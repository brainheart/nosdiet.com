Hi Mashavu,

Welcome! Your pattern of months of &quot;meticulous
adherence&quot; followed by unrestrained binging is exactly
what the nosdiet is designed to disrupt. A week on a
typical diet builds resentment at all the wonderful
things you can no longer eat or all the work it takes
counting points or carbs or calories. There are only
so many of these you can take without an explosion. A
week on the nosdiet builds good, long term habits.
There are only so many of these you need before habit
starts carrying you along rather than fighting against
you tooth and nail.

It's not easy, and it's not fast, but it's possible,
and it's really rather pleasant once you get into the
swing of it. Keep us posted as to your progress, and
bug us if you run into trouble.

Reinhard

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a new member and I just wanted to say hello to
&gt; everyone. My name 
&gt; is Mashavu (don't even try to pronounce it), I'm 30,
&gt; and I'm in 
&gt; Ohio. I begin my Nosdiet on Monday. 
&gt; 
&gt; I found my way to this site by way of the FIRM
&gt; Ya-Ya's board. I am a 
&gt; FIRM addict, and have been for the better part of 7
&gt; years (waaaay 
&gt; before the awful infomercials). I have found what
&gt; works for me when 
&gt; it comes to exercise. My diet, however, is another
&gt; story entirely. 
&gt; Finding what works for me, dietwise, has been a
&gt; rather tenebrous 
&gt; journey. I am cognizant that all my sweat is
&gt; largely futile until I 
&gt; get a handle on my diet.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't do complicated diets. After about 3 months
&gt; of meticulous 
&gt; adherence, they send me into a murderous rage, and
&gt; in between rages --
&gt; I binge eat. Just not a good combo.
&gt; 
&gt; It is my sincerest hope that this is the last diet I
&gt; will ever have 
&gt; to try.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Have a great day!
&gt; 
&gt; Mashavu
