&gt; hello deborah.. i hope this post finds you well. i hope that you 
are having a great weekend and that you have not mentally given up. 
...Thanks very much Donna :)
I feel lots better and am enjoying my weekend..
Giving up, not an option.
Just felt sad that night and had to lean on all your shoulders :)
By the way, regarding calcium, I read in a Tums ad about relieving 
some pms moood symptoms, that it actually takes 3 months straight of 
taking the calcium daily (I think they recommended about 700-1000 
mg?) to see any marked improvement. So try it out, but 10 days might 
not show any results... Also, I read an article that often the 
copper/iron levels in the blood get all out of whack, with copper 
getting too high...and also I think magnesium is necessary too.
My suggestion is consult a clinical nutritionist and I have found 
also, personally, that I crave salty foods, but the one time that I 
decided to limit my salt intake by really not eating processed foods 
and putting almost no salt into foods (but the processed stuff is 
the worst in terms of sodium, you know salad dressings, soup, 
pickles) My symptoms were much better... I think the sodium would 
raise the blood pressure and also contribute greatly to bloating and 
water retention, which puts pressure on you physically and mentally.
It's a catch22 though, because salty foods are what seem to be my 
craving food before my period. Getting proper rest is crucial too.
I was really not getting enough for a day or two and that messed 
with me too. Knowing that NoS isn't a crazy plan which will once 
again after other crazy plans, leave me stranded one day, I am happy 
to have it as a reliable friend. As are all my Nosser compadres :)
Peace and Love,
Deb
