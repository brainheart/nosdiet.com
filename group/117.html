The &quot;orthodox&quot; nosdiet position, as Justin stated, is
to have the fruit with your meals.

&quot;with&quot; doesn't mean you have to mix them together.
I'll eat the fruit before or after, but as part of the
same conceptual (if not actually physical) plate. You
don't have to physically put it on the same plate if
that weirds you out (though it's good practice and I'd
recommend it for beginners) as long as you budget for
it when your putting other food on your plate. An
imaginary apple next to your hamburger will do just
fine.

Most of the fruit I eat is attached (however
tenuously) to a meal. And that's what I'd recommend to
beginners especially. Sure fruit is a healthy snack,
but eating it with a meal keeps you from eating
something less healthy in its place. What if you break
down and have fruit as a snack? Don't worry too much
about it. On the scale of nosdiet violations, it's a
minor misdemeanor. Much better that reaching for the
chips ahoy.

I wouldn't recommend eating just fruit as a meal. I
can't imagine it would fill you up enough, and it's
probably not even healthy. And fresh fruit never
counts as a &quot;sweet,&quot; in case you're wondering.

&gt; I try to incorporate fruit in a meal. For example,
&gt; yesterday at
&gt; lunch, I didn't eat everything in one sititng. I
&gt; had a leftover
&gt; banana that I ate about an hour later. Still, I had
&gt; originally
&gt; included it in my lunch. Usually though, I try to
&gt; eat everything at
&gt; one meal and not slip in to snacking! Just my
&gt; thoughts. Reinhard
&gt; might have a different view.

&gt; &gt; It's me again. So are you saying one can eat fruit
&gt; during the week with meals
&gt; &gt; or as a meal, which ever? Or are you saying only
&gt; on S days? Because to me,
&gt; &gt; fruit is more of a &quot;snack&quot; than anything else.
&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for your help,
&gt; &gt; Jackie
