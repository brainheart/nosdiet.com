I have tried numerous diets, not always in an attempt
to lose weight but more in an attempt to conduct
&quot;experiments of one.&quot; These diets included low carb
and high carb, low fat and high fat, vegan, raw foods,
and even the beer diet found at
www.beerisgoodforyou.com.\

I've tried eating all of my meals before 4 PM and then
after 4 PM, and versions of the old adages, &quot;eat
breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner
like a pauper.&quot; Or the more brutal Russian version,
&quot;eat breakfast alone, share lunch with a friend, and
give your dinner to the enemy.&quot; 

One of the most frequent problems that I encountered
while conducting my experiments of one was while
eating socially. I often was unable to find foods to
fit my diet when I was on these diets. I turned down a
number of lunch and dinner events because the meal
timing wasn't right or I thought food would be
unavailable to meet my needs. 

The 'no s' diet quietly resolves just about every
peripheral issue one might have while dieting. Most
people will not even recognize that you are on a diet.
They may praise you for your temperance when you
refuse seconds and decline dessert, but other than
that the no-s diet is portable and compatible with
practically any social event.
