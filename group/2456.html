I am certainly guilty of the black and white approach to dieting or the all or 
nothing approach. I have discovered that if I am not ON A DIET, I eat all of those 
foods that are not traditionally allowed on said diet and NONE of the foods allowed 
on the diet. In other words, if I am not following a particular diet, I would never 
think of having a salad for lunch. Instead, I will have a huge sandwich, chips, 
cookie.... I am 47 years old and have spent most of my adult life either on a diet or 
on a binge. I gain and lose the same 20-30 pounds every year. Definitely not healthy 
and very frustrating. I did maintain a weight loss for about a year following low 
carb -- but then I met my fiance and thought I could just eat anything and everything 
and for the last 3 years have been back on the diet yo-yo. 

I discovered NoS last summer and have yet to get 21 days slashed off. My black &amp; 
white approach means I am either following the NoS rules (which are not difficult, 
really) or I am eating out of control. This past week I realized that even if I am 
not ON NoS, I can still have a NoS day as I work my way back. One day is better than 
no days. So, I have realized this but have yet to put it into practice. I think I 
will do that this week. 

I really do wish it were as simple as eating 3 meals a day but there is a lot of 
baggage that needs to be cleared out.

Valerie. If we were to take a poll of this group, and I am 
suggesting that you all chime in here, hint hint, I would venture a 
guess that your black and white view of &quot;things&quot; in general, is a 

common trait amongst many others of us.. I am that way, and I'm 
slowly trying to see the &quot;grey&quot; in life... It's a very unproductive 

way of thinking, as you mentioned, and can be downright 
detrimental...The reason is, I feel, that this thinking comes from a 
place of Judgement...and in terms of diet, when you &quot;fall off the 

horse&quot; instead of saying &quot;oops I hurt my heinie a little, now I will 

just get back on and try some more&quot; the thought processes usually 

lead to a very vicious cycle of &quot;I failed, this stinks, I stink, why 

bother, eat more because I stink, gain more weight, feel 
stinkier&quot;...you get the idea..
As Reinhard says in the Mainpage for NoS &quot;Zero percent of 100 is 
still zero&quot; something is infinitely better than not trying at all.
