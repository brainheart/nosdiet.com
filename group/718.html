Hi 
I didnt think about that. I have brown sugar on my oatmeal in the morning. I guess I 
thought that was ok. Anyways I have been terrible this last couple days. I have had 
some family trouble. I dont know how many of you are emotional eaters, but 
unfortuanately I am. But Im working on it. Ive promised my self no more slip ups the 
rest of the week.

Oh, yeah? Well, I have some pretty fast Corgis. Imagine them racing 
your greyhounds on a straightaway. Watch out.:-)

I'm on spring break, slept in late, and felt like making waffles. 
Then I realized that the only thing I put on them are jams or syrups. 
Oh well. Some things aren't worth worrying about. I'll tend to keep 
my waffle urges for the weekends. Applesauce is a good substitute, 
but I didn't feel like it.

After no change the first two months since starting in January, I am 
now down 5.5 kilos, I mean 12 lbs. - that sounds better. Weigh 
yourself in kilos, lose weight in pounds.

Hana, do greyhounds fall down and roll on their backs when they get 
the giggles? I think my Corgis really have a chance.

Tom
