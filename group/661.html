you're wrong on writing it all down...just like money...if you dont account for 
it..most of time you don't know what u did wrong...you gotta have some consistentency 
in your life..the old body has to be known its not in charge..you are...so write it 
down..no matter how boring..at least you know for sure if you don't eat right or when 
you';re sticking to it.. working for me.. and I have tried many many diets...they 
can't be temporary..so make it a good interesting one for health sake mostly!!!!

I posted my intro and I
left a lot out. It was after midnight where I am so I was a little
tired and forgetful. I have been trying to lose weight for about a
year with some success and mostly set backs. I have 4 children
7,5,3,1 and a husband I have been nuts about for 9 years and counting.
I am a big believer in learning more from your failures than your
successes. So when a diet fails, it's one less diet that works for
you. You can rule out all diets that have X as part of the weightloss
equation.

In regards to food diaries, they work, they get monotonous and then
you stop writing in them so they stop working. I did it this summer
faithfully for about a month and a half loseing 10lbs. then I stopped
and the 10 lbs came back and brought friends. 

Regarding working moms. I have done this too, (I have been a SAHM
since my last child was born) My advice from other diet failures, plan
all your meals, pack yourself a healthy tasty sack lunch. If you have
access to a microwave you could bring leftovers,or open a can of
soup to go with a sandwhich or a salad some of those frozen meals are
pretty good. Sit at your desk or whereever and eat while you reward
yourself by reading a book you've been wanting to read. Depending
on how much time you have you could go to a park and walk before after
or during your lunch. If your kids are in daycare, if you have time
you could eat lunch with your kids.

Regarding pop. I have been off the Sodapop wagon multiple times what
I have found works the best. Make your own flavored water. I like to
add a tsp of lemon juice to every quart of water I drink. you could
add any flavor juice to your water,cranberry,lime, apple, grape,
berry. You get the idea. 

Good luck everyone. I look forward to chat with you.
Melanie
