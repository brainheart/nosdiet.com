Hey everone :)
I was thinking how helpful it is to be part of this group and have 
that much needed &quot;lifeline&quot; of support.
Knowing that we are all in this together makes it really nice.

Yesterday as I was pondering this first idea when I had a flashback 
to that old episode of The Flintstones when Fred decides to join 
overeaters anonymous...That scene where he is about to eat a whole 
turkey in the middle of the night, and his group leader catches him 
in the act by peeping into the window. Then he snatches the turkey 
out the window using a bow and arrow attached to a string, 
accompanied by an official group &quot;alarm sound&quot; that resembles a 

turkey blowing a &quot;raspberry&quot; I couldn't stop laughing.

If you didn't see it well I guess you had to in order to laugh.
It is a visual joke.

But if you did let me know...I was cracking up thinking about it
(juvenille sense of humor that I have LOL)

Our group reminds me of that
Without the club turkey call of course :)
It's like we are monitoring everything together, even in our 
&quot;middle of the night&quot; moments..Which I think is great, actually.
Some people I have been emailing directly, have mentioned that they 
read every post and try to gain wisdom from what they have read. And 
it sure beats paying 15 dollars a week to join Weight Watchers
Except for Reinhard that is, sorry coach, I did look at your post 
about residual &quot;revenue&quot; and I did, infact, feel &quot;sorry for you&quot; 
LOL

Shovelglovving went really well today, but it is 3 or 4 hours later 
now and I am still totally floored from the amount of energy 
expended during those, very, very, long 14 minutes. Now I am in 
full shlepping mode, and slowing down more and more with every 
passing moment. The 14 minutes was just enough time to listen to 
Good Times Bad Times, Your time is gonna come, and most of I Can't 
Quit Her..PS Rondelle, whole lotta love is on Led Zep II
And I'm gonna do it again tomorrow, because I think I am a glutton 
for punishment...In all honesty, like I told SG group right after, 
it was really exhillarating...I liked it alot..But very demanding

&quot;Willlllmaaaaa&quot;
Love,
Deb
