Savells &quot;I've been doing for 2 weeks and doing NoS for a week now...&quot;

Engels: This isn't a significant amount of time either for the
diet or the exercise. You've got plenty more left on this frontier. 
Opening up new ones will just be a distraction and an excuse to 
fail. 

....Amen Reinhard, it really isn't a good amount of time, I totally 
agree... Here is where we are seeing the extremely detrimental 
effects of &quot;quick fix&quot; diet mentality... Every weight loss plan sell 

itself by advertising a certain amount you will lose in the first 
week or two, so we are really seeing a serious mental obstacle, in 
Kirsties thinking, which I believe we all have in us, which really 
needs to be addressed directly...To drop the &quot;immediate satisfaction 

with immediate results&quot; thinking... I have thought this way many 
times, and I will even venture a guess that our erudite and 
wonderful leader has encountered thinking like this in his life 
before &quot;NoS&quot; dawned on him :)
It's a societally driven setup which we all buy into on some level...
If I think of more on this I will add to it later, but I've actually 
got 3 clients today, a record for this first year of business! So 
I'll pick up on this train of thought later.. Meanwhile, please 
someone else jump right in! Okilly dokilly?

&gt; Cool it with the pecan pies and you'll see a
difference, trust me. Just give it some time.
Reinhard

...Again, amen to that. Kirstie, come on! You have 15 lbs to lose 
right? Let me give you something to think about... You are young 
and I assume your metabolism is up higher than mine, but maybe not 
quite as high as my 8 year old son, soon to be 9 in the end of March.
Last year at this time of year, we had a unhealthy tradition of 
having a &quot;little&quot; dessert each night.. I didn't really have that 

much of this and my problem was seconds and just huge portions...
Richard however, had 3 to 4 cookies an evening for dessert... I also 
allowed him about 2 or 3 sodas a week. He started to get a little 
chubby after several months, and believe me, he is a very very 
active child and can run around for hours a day. Still the cookies 
were adding up on him. We started NoS in September and he decided to 
support my decision and do it with me... Since he has cut out the 
cookies and soda only (since I allow him a healthy snack, like a 
slice of bread with some peanut butter or a string cheese or a piece 
of fruit, when he gets home since he is really hungry and he is 
growing, unlike yours truly) he has gone down probably about 10 lbs, 
since his very tight pants are all now loose on him and you can 
really see he has lost his stomach... If you only have 15 lbs to 
lose and can stick it out for a few months of really cutting out the 
very fattening sugary stuff, not in a week okay!, you will do 
great! :) In the meantime I think it's just time for some tough love 
and you should stop bringing in sweets to the house which you find 
impossible to resist...Only you can make or break the decision to be 
successful here, and you are worth it....I let Richard have sweets 
still but he has them on S days...So pecan pies?,,,save them for 
Saturday and then &quot;geh gesint&quot; enjoy them then :)
Love,
Deb
