You don't sound defeatist... Anyone who thinks they can go a whole 
lifetime without some failures (look Reinhard I used fail in a 
sentence!) is a fool...
You're no fool and you know what you are dealing with...
Just recognizing that and coming to terms with your demons is a step 
in the right direction... so many would prefer to jump ship or just 
stay in denial... I actually think that the short term quick fix 
mentality is way more fatalistic... Every now and then I can hear 
that &quot;come on go on slimfast&quot; or some other bs voice trying to 

reroute my already highly squandered willpower on yet another 
fruitless effort... This is because I too have ups and downs and I 
guess it's just more gratifying to be constantly succeeding... but 
where will that lead me? I know in my heart of hearts that it's not 
a solution.. just more or a setup for future &quot;habit deprogramming&quot;
Quick fix mentality is such a formidable foe in this society... We 
can't even imagine trying to be patient at something... Everything 
is &quot;now now now&quot;... NoS is probably the last hope for normal eating 

this country will ever know, but it's not the &quot;norm&quot; when we are all 

programmed to either &quot;overdo&quot; eating with supersized stuff 
or &quot;undereating&quot; with crazy diets... Okay my rant is done...
Thanks for listening to me all you people.. I will send you some 
ibuprofen if you have a head ache now! LOL...

Reinhard and I have some difference of opinion regarding the use of 
words sometimes... Setback, screwup, failure...Whatever..
If you don't give up and you want it bad enough you can create the 
life you desire... No one said it would be easy and congrats for 
staying realistic...
Good luck!
Love,
Deb
