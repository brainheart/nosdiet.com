 Hello Amanda,
This past weekend I did an S day on Saturday, and decided yesterday,
Sunday, to no S for a change because I felt I was going overboard on the
weekend,,,erasing all my hard work during.the week..I know Reinhard says 
not
to do that, but I am in Menopause
and it is very hard to lose a pound, not like when we woman are younger. 
As
I tend to go a bit crazy with bread, pasta , and pizza, I 
try to just avoid those things...the only sweet I love is ice cream, so 
that
is difficult as it is a Sugar and a Snack, but also my downfall in my &quot;3rd
Age&quot; as the French say. So although it is kind of a low carb diet, no 
sugar
and no white flour, I do enjoy some whole grains, like oatmeal, and some
fruit, along with some bean dishes, like lentils, some dairy...cheese and
sugarless yougart,
and lots of lean meats, fish and veges...not potatoes-however, green veges..
.lots of Salads.
No S says you can eat white flour, but I do not &quot;wear it well&quot;
no Sugar is the best part of no S, as again that is a &quot;momment on the 
lips,
forever on the hips&quot;.
What fills me up other than Big Salads, the mainstay of my husbands and
my diet, are lots of Stir frys....meat or Shrimp, and green veges, and
Sometimes almonds or cashews thrown in, fried in olive oil. we also avoid
deep fried and trans fatty foods.
Well this works pretty well for us.
Bonnie

I'm wondering if you all could post some favorite
meals. Not the recipes, necessarily, just thought we could share
what we eat during the NoS week.
