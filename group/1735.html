OK Deb,
Don't worry about the earring, the hole is small and when he tires
of the earring, the hole may heal over or barely be noticeable.
In 1972 when I was in the Army I pierced my ear, really out there in
'72. Eventually I ended up with four. When earrings became more normal
then non-conformist I quit wearing them. 
Now to the point. My three oldest boys got their ears pierced when
they were 10, 9, and 5 respectively (1984). The oldest went on to have
the earrings with a 1/2 inch hole in the centers you could look through.
None of them wear earrings now, and unless you know to look and get up
close you would never know.
Long hair and earrings - no big deal. Save the battle for TATTOOS.
noS'ing and lovin it, David H.

&gt; Nice photo Deb. Your son is adorable. My boys are 24 and 20. I 
&gt; guess my oldest boy is 56. :)


Thank you Lee :) That was Richard at 5 when I was still doing home 
haircuts (with crayola safety scissors to boot) and I was going for 
a Beatles moptop look :)
He is blossoming into a very handsome young boy and will be nine in 
March...He is also counting the months until then because he thinks 
I am going to let him get an earring! OY VEY!
I just hope he loses interest by then....What next? 
So I am venturing a guess that your &quot;oldest boy&quot; is your hubby?
Good luck on your next scale &quot;showdown&quot;...High noon.
Here's a little message about being scared about things in the 
future.

&quot;Release that which is going out. Embrace that which is coming in. 

Leave alone that which has not yet come. Want nothing, and embrace 
everything.&quot;

With this being Fall it's the time of year for letting go.
I am trying to let go of so much, and I am starting with my old self 
destructive behavior and habits...
Thanks for everyones ongoing help and support!
Love,
Deb
