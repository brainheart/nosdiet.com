Wow Deb! How old is Richard? I'm lucky to be able to do simple addition in my head . 


I can relate to being happy just to maintain. For the past year as I've tried to gain 
weight I've watched the scale slowly creep higher and higher. So far this two weeks 
on NoS, my weight has stayed the same. If I maintain the same weight for the next 
couple months I'll be thrilled. 

Here's a good quote I saw today, wanted to share it with you all. Have a great day 
guys!

Carrie :)

&gt; dear deb, ......you know what it is to be &quot;normal&quot;
.....Now *that's* funny! I am certainly unfamiliar with normal, but 
if you say so!!! :)

&gt;looking forward to being at that point myself. love and 
&gt; best wishes.. donna o
....Same to you Donna O :)
I found the group in the end of August...I know what you mean Donna, 
I was just goofing around :)
You are right about my perspective truly changing for the best.
Oh NoS! You have *ruined* me for all other diets! LOL
Once I start to move my booty, some more pounds should fall off :)
I know this sounds a little lame, but even if I only maintain this 
Winter, and don't gain anything, I would be somewhat pleased...
Of course, I wouldn't be upset if I lost some weight, but the 
tendency to gain gain gain during these months is so strong, that if 
I can cruise through the Winter and get clear of the &quot;red zone&quot; 

without more damage, I will still be pretty happy. I must move my 
tuchus and plan on having a nice walk tomorrow with Richard... I had 
some treatments at the Spa today and just came home very mushed 
out...
We had a nice fire and spaced out... I almost fell asleep watching 
it. Richard, on the other hand, was doing math equations in his head 
for fun...this, to him, is entertainment... He was figuring out how 
many days are in 5 years, then dividing it into hours, then into 
minutes, etc.... Child prodigy? He astounds me!
Peace and Love,
Deb :)
