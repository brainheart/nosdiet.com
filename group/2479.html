Hi guys you didn't actually think I wouldn't post something today! 
LOL :) I'm feeling better...Thanks Listerine! (gag choke blech!) 
just kidding.... Sleeping for 24 hours did the trick :)
Well I guess everyones out stuffing their stockings and wrapping 
their gifts... I picked out a sweater for my partner Robert, and 
came in today, wanting to surprise him... He said, &quot;why are you so 

happy?&quot; since I cleary was beaming from ear to ear with 
anticipatory happiness of giving a gift... I had so much fun just 
picking out his present, it gave me more joy than receiving one...
So on a holiday note I figured that I'd write a little ode to the 
group, just to say that I have had so much fun being part of the 
posters here and the support I have received, both from getting 
feedback, and collective &quot;rooting&quot;, plus having an outlet to voice 

my (numerous! LOL) ideas and feelings, has been invaluable in my 
quest towards health and happiness...
I hope when the holiday business is passed more people come back 
into the picture (besides me because that would be pretty boring!)
and our collective NoS efforts are rewarded!
Meanwhile have fun with your families and friends
and a wish to all for a harmonious and cheerful holiday!
I hope Santa brings you all a nice present!
Love,
Debbie
