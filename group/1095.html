Portion size seems to be a useful key. I saw something on a TV programme
once, which showed a plate with a design inside the central part and another
on the rim.The idea was &quot;you may cover the central pattern with food, 
but
not the rim.&quot; I personally have plain white plates, but keep my portions 
of
everything except steamed veggies to the centre of the plate and it's
working for me.

&gt; Wow, thanks for all the responses guys! True, sometimes I tend to
&gt; get a bit impatient (hehe). Anyway, as for the warrior diet question
&gt; and why I like the philosophy:
&gt;
&gt; Basically, a few reasons
&gt;
&gt; 1. The ultimate aim is to limit total daily caloric intake to 1
&gt; sitting. And for someone like me, who can be &quot;good&quot; all day if 
he
&gt; knows a good dinner is on the way, that is a godsend.
&gt;
&gt; 2. I live at home with my family, and coming home, a good Indian
&gt; dinner is always ready (and is pretty nutritious) so I don't have 
to
&gt; worry bout constantly eating the wrong kind of food on this diet.
&gt;
&gt; 3. I enjoyed feeling light on my feet and not having an excuse to 
be
&gt; lazy (the approach of mealtime sometimes tends to do that to me)
&gt; throughout the day since I work at an Investment Bank.
&gt;
&gt; HOWEVER, there are a few reasons why I chose the NoSdiet instead:
&gt;
&gt; 1. I am not what you call a consistent person in much of anything. 
I
&gt; have the all or nothing mentality. Thankfully, up until now,
&gt; the &quot;all&quot; phases in my life have balanced the &quot;nothing&quot; 
phases in my
&gt; life in terms of fitness and gotten me to 170 lbs. But I know I could
&gt; have already reached my goals if I had not been so extreme. The
&gt; warrior diet, I fear, might just enhance my extreme nature towards
&gt; diet and I don't want that. I want to be able to adhere to a plan
&gt; centered on moderation with some rules, like the NoSdiet. Then, when
&gt; I am ready, mebbe I can switch to the Warrior diet.
&gt;
&gt; 2. I fear the physiological effects of the WD. I think that people
&gt; who are overweight are more sensitive to storing extra calories
&gt; ingested in one meal as fat then slim people. To that end, I think
&gt; the WD would be better as a maintenance type of diet once you reach
&gt; the weight you want.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Reinhard,
&gt;
&gt; The main problem I have with &quot;maybe&quot; overeating is that in my 
case,
&gt; it's not so obvious. The problem is mostly centered around dinner.
&gt; That is where the &quot;no seconds&quot; part is harder for me. The type 
of
&gt; food I eat is vegetarian and not too fatty, so the calories are less.
&gt; The problem is that I can't not have seconds unless I absolutely cram
&gt; my plate with food the first time! However, it's slowly getting
&gt; easier to guage how much I need so that the next day, I am not
&gt; starving but not stuffed either. I am also working out daily so that
&gt; tempers this problem a bit until I get a handle on it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
