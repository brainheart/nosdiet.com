Well, after my first full week, yesterday I had an early lunch, leading to 

early dinner, and found that at 7:30pm I was starving. I didn't touch 
anything for another half hour, then I thought. &quot;If I get 2 'S' days during 

the week, why can't one of them be a 'W' day?&quot; So I decided to bend the 

rules a little bit. I'm taking Sunday away from myself, and put it on 
Wednesday. I had a can of root beer (non caffinated, slightly lower in the 

calorie/sugar than the coke I would normally have) and a couple crackers. 

I think this is pretty acceptable, and if it's not...Well...oh well. That 

seemed to help quite a bit..Today we got a pop order in and I barely wanted 

to open one up while organizing. Had a trusty water bottle (that I brought 

from home) by my side to keep me company. If this idea helps anyone...

&gt; Lynda,
&gt; Those are great suggestions! I drink water all day now out of habit.
&gt; I like it just plain and hadn't thought about &quot;kicking it up 
a
&gt; notch&quot;. I can almost feel it cleansing my system. Oddly enough, 
I
&gt; even like to have warm water as a replacement for coffee sometimes.
&gt; It's comforting!

&gt; &gt; My thoughts on the soda topic:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Soda prevents your body from absorbing vitamins and nutrients. 
Maybe
&gt; &gt; knowing that your soda intake cancels out most of the benefits of 
the
&gt; &gt; healthier foods you eat will help you think twice when you are making 
a
&gt; &gt; decision whether or not to get your soda &quot;fix&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you decide to drink the soda and gradually cut back, I'd go with 
the
&gt; &gt; regular soda. There are too many health risks associated with the 

imitation
&gt; &gt; sugars and the taste of the imitation stuff is much sweeter than sugar 
is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You can make water a ritual if that will help.
&gt; &gt; *	Buy a pretty crystal wine glass or pretty tea cup and saucer that you 

use
&gt; &gt; only for your water.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *	Have lemon wedges prepared and available to squeeze into your 
water.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *	Put a few cherries into your water or a few pieces of frozen 
fruit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *	Put juice into ice trays and use a few frozen juice cubes in your 

water.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *	Get one of those cool drink stirers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *	Pamper yourself and put your feet up when you drink your water.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You can make it as much of a ritual as you want it to be. Try it, you 
will
&gt; &gt; feel MUCH better. :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Keep us posted on your progress.

&gt; &gt; Hi Tammy,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you've been able to pull off no-s except for soda,
&gt; &gt; you've got a firm foundation of willpower to stand on.
&gt; &gt; Congratulations, and give yourself some credit!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now for the pop issue. As you suggest, pop isn't just
&gt; &gt; pop. Psychologically, it's a lot more to many people.
&gt; &gt; It's a break, a ritual, and a drug like cigarrettes.
&gt; &gt; So we need to find you a surrogate, something to take
&gt; &gt; it's place.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These are the things pop does and the categories on
&gt; &gt; which we'll have to evaluate a potential replacement:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Health impact
&gt; &gt; Ritual
&gt; &gt; Drug appeal
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Water has a positive health impact, not much ritual,
&gt; &gt; and no drug appeal. Cigarettes are wonderful for
&gt; &gt; ritual and drug appeal but have a nasty tendency to
&gt; &gt; kill you. Tea or coffee (easy on the sugar/cream, I
&gt; &gt; drink mine black) do pretty well in every department.
&gt; &gt; If that's not up your alley, diet drinks are probably
&gt; &gt; better than non diet drinks, except 1) I'm suspicious
&gt; &gt; about what the awful chemicals in there are going to
&gt; &gt; do to you down the road and 2) the sweetness messes
&gt; &gt; with the habit forming portion of your brain.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So from best to worse:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Water
&gt; &gt; Tea (green, especially)
&gt; &gt; Coffee (black)
&gt; &gt; Diet Soda
&gt; &gt; Sugar Soda
&gt; &gt; Cigarrettes
&gt; &gt; 12 gauge shotgun in mouth
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Go as far up the scale as you can... if diet soda is
&gt; &gt; the best you can do right now then don't beat yourself
&gt; &gt; up about it. Revisit the issue in a couple months when
&gt; &gt; you've graduated to the next level of willpower.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Congratulations on making it your first weekend,
&gt; &gt; &gt; even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it was only part of a week and there were some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stretchers. If it takes a few days to find your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stride, don't worry about it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Strictness is a tool, not an end in itself. But I
&gt; &gt; &gt; find
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that strictness makes it easier, and it's what I'd
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advise most people to try. I'm thrilled that
&gt; &gt; &gt; Teresa
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has lost weight using No-s, and I don't begrudge
&gt; &gt; &gt; her
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her few candy corns (congratulations, Teresa, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sorry for responding to two posts at once). But I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personally would rather not have to worry about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;some&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turning into &quot;way too much.&quot; &quot;No&quot; is harder 
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; sneak
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up on. Do what works for you of course, and best
&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; luck.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, at the mid point of day 2, let me tell you
&gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit more about my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;situation.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I work in the athletic department of a high
&gt; &gt; &gt; school.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not a teacher, I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a coach, I just do random stuff. I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; basically
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an assistant athletic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; director, though this district doesn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; officially
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have one. The point of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this, is I make dirt for money, but the
&gt; &gt; &gt; department
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes up for it by giving
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me kick backs. Coke, which we stock the
&gt; &gt; &gt; machines
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; throughout the school, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sell at sporting events, is mine for the taking
&gt; &gt; &gt; (and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dasani water is what we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sell, which is the sodium containing
&gt; &gt; &gt; water...yuk).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is kinda the point where it doesn't matter
&gt; &gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm late, so long as I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in by the time school starts, I'm SUPPOSED to 
be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there a half hour ahead of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway...Yesterday I did well, until I realized
&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was going to dinner with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some old co-workers, we went to Baker's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Square...Couldn't pass up some pie,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I kinda made it a special day, that was all 
I
&gt; &gt; &gt; did
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though, no snacks, no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pop.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today at work, first we get the concession stand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delivery in, so what do I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do for a half hour? Yeah, I stick M&amp;M's and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Snickers on a shelf. That was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard to pass up, but I made it. Then we get a
&gt; &gt; &gt; fund
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raiser rep. in showing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us his different candy options, and since last
&gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he came around, we got
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him 2 of our coaches buying from him, he gave 
us
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free samples...We each got
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about 5 bags of M&amp;M's. Wow, was it hard not
&gt; &gt; &gt; eating
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them on the way home.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll save 'em for those S days though.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right now, I'm hungry, and wanting a snack, so
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gonna go mow the lawn. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guess 2 good things will come about with this,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; housework will get done too,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'eh?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again for listening, and giving out this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole idea.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome and good luck! Here's my take on 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues you raise:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the pop, nothing beats water,
&gt; &gt; &gt; obviously,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you might want to consider tea as well. If 
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of those hot water spigots at the cooler
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fast, and if they give away pop, they probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away tea, too. If you are sensitive to
&gt; &gt; &gt; caffeine,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; green
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tea is very weak and supposed to have all
&gt; &gt; &gt; kinds of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; health benefits. Herbal teas have no caffeine.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crazy about tea, I prefer coffee, but it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; just so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy and less contentious in terms of health.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hot, so you drink it slow, and the little
&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the tea bag seems to fulfill my &quot;looking 
for
&gt; &gt; &gt; oral
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distraction&quot; requirement.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the pop-tarts/nutrigrain bars for
&gt; &gt; &gt; breakfast
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issue, I'm not a picky eater, and since my
&gt; &gt; &gt; wife
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get up way before I do, I tend not to be 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; huge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rush in the mornings. So I can't speak to 
your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from vast personal experience.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've always considered cold cereal pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt; quick,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it sounds like you need to be out so fast
&gt; &gt; &gt; you're
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating in the car... not the most conducive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; environment to cheerio consumption. You know,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes might put cold cereal within striking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; range.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would setting the alarm clock 5 minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; earlier be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the question? Or could you keep a stash 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cereal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and milk at work? Or do what I do, keep a
&gt; &gt; &gt; stash of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oatmeal, nuts and dried fruit at work (though
&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usually eat this for lunch). If you could 
do
&gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these it would expand your horizons
&gt; &gt; &gt; significantly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are *a lot* of different kinds of low/no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sugar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cereal.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bread is also a big category - it's not just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; toasted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wonder or thomases english muffins. Mix it 
up
&gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different cheese and a different piece of
&gt; &gt; &gt; fruit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning and even the same old bread can seem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novel. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't know your exact tastes in this
&gt; &gt; &gt; depeartment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spend some time seriously scoping out the
&gt; &gt; &gt; bakery,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cheese and fruit sections are your
&gt; &gt; &gt; supermarket.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll wrack my brains about it a bit, but 
for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being I'd suggest not letting this problem 
be
&gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breaker for you. Pop tarts are clearly out.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nutrigrain bars might be considered
&gt; &gt; &gt; temporarily
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exempt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until you can think of something less sugary.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, they are *marketed* as healthy, and 
all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considered, are probably less awful for you
&gt; &gt; &gt; than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pop
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarts. Emphasis on 'temporary,' and don't 
let
&gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every day. Hopefully you'll get enough
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alternatives
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested here in this group (and by the
&gt; &gt; &gt; mother of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invention) that you won't have to resort 
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often/at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question I had, but it wasn't even 
about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loss. I decided
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this may very well be the way I've 
been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for to loose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight all this time. I've gained ~60
&gt; &gt; &gt; pounds in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last 4 years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most being in the last 2 years. The 
other
&gt; &gt; &gt; night
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to stop drinking pop like I do...Which
&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constantly. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard since I get it free at work, and 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water here has a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant amount of sodium, so you 
just
&gt; &gt; &gt; end up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more thirsty after
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drinking it, but I'm gonna do it. This 
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step up for me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I'm pretty sure I can handle most of 
it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the bat, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of it soon. Thanks for making this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; availible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now for a question that I know has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addressed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not &quot;to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfaction.&quot; Breakfast, I wake 
up
&gt; &gt; &gt; litterally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes before I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to be at work, and it's a 20 
minute
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (yes I'm late
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every day, but that's a whole 'nother 
story)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nutrigrain bars and pop
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarts have been a Godsend to me. Not 
only
&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm a VERY picky
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eater, and most common breakfast foods 
are
&gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liking. I do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love a good bowl of Cheerios or something
&gt; &gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I frankly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't have the time for them. Toast 
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; great,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; english muffins
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too...but every day? I don't think I'd 
like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that...Any other ideas
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out there...Maybe there was some of 
this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addressed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I either
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glanced over it or missed it in the 
archive,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sorry
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it is just a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repeat. Thanks for the help!!
