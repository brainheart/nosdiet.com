&gt; i know i told deb &quot;nothing is worth ruining ur day for&quot; and 

eventhough i still think this way... the fact remains the same: it 
took so little to ruin TWO DAYS for me......! just one phone call 
from my ex, followed by a reeeeeeeeally bad day at college was all 
it took for me to feel it s&quot;OK&quot; to screw up..! not solely is it a 

matter of &quot;comfort eating&quot; but more of &quot;every single aspect of my 

life is a total mess so why sould this be an exception?&quot; - kind -of 
-
thing...! i couldnt handle it as well as u did, deb..

....Deeyala :)
I have some pretty screwed up days too my friend! Just move on baby!

&gt; and my screwing up wasnt a matter of quantity but of returning 
back to my 12 meals per day.. no shovelgloveing.. and loads and 
loads of &quot;seconds&quot;.. i am not really a &quot;sweets person&quot;.. but even 
a 
packet of those came in handy... he he he...!
&gt; so i screwed it up... and i ll try not to do it again (a more 
bright attitude)... but i am sort of worried cause nosdiet worked 
great for me as long as i was feeling great..... it didnt work when 
i was depressed.....!love dee


...Deeyala, you're just still sad that Reinhard is married...Get 
over it girl! LOL...
..Well here's some food for thought...
How do you think you would have behaved had you been on some other 
diet...If you are just reverting back to old ways, which by the way 
are not so old okay! You've only been on this thing for a really 
short time... Darn Girl.. Don't give up on us now!
This is a Life plan.. it will take you practice and since you have 
had such a &quot;grazing&quot; kind of life for so long, lets face it, you are 

up against some pretty ingrained behavior...
But it's behavior...It can change..
Think of every time that you succeed, even if this means cutting 
down from 12 meals to 10 then 8 then you get the picture, as a 
reason for something &quot;Going Right&quot; in your life when you feel like 

everything else ain't...
And please, tell your ex that he can take a flying leap for me!
Then shove a glove where the sun don't shine, and get medieval on 
his ass,,,phalt....

As my friend Richard, from Shovelglove has said before in a 
conversation about &quot;ex's&quot;
&quot;The best revenge is living well!&quot;
And when that don't work...
Pop some Grateful Dead on the stereo, because no one can stay down 
when they hear Jerry sing and play! Woo hoo..
&quot;Wave that flag, wave it wide and high!!!&quot;
---from US Blues, Grateful Dead...

Don't give up hope!
Oh and &quot;hee hee hee&quot; to you too!
Love,
Deb
