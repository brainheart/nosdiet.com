I am aware that there are cultural patterns to this, but has anyone any
ideas on what to have for a quick breakfast. On days when I work, 3 a week,
I need to be at school for 0830 and have 4 dogs and a cat to see to before 
I
leave home, so time is tight.I know that I need to control fats as well 
as
sugar, so toast isn't the best for me and I don't have time to cook. Just
occasionally,I go to the school canteen at morning break and buy a bread
roll with a rasher of bacon in. They grill the bacon well in the school
kitchen, so there isn't a significant amount of fat left, but break isn't
until 1045 and by then I am genuinely hungry.I have a salad from the salad
bar for lunch.
