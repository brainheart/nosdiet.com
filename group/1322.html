Hey Jen, how about Reinhard is the Antiguru, messiah of diets? Or is 
that just going to go to his head?
Love
Deb

&gt; dear deb
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for responding to my first post ..... and so thoughtfully 
too :) it
&gt; is great to get feedback :)
&gt; 
&gt; what is your favorite fragrant flower?
&gt; My personal fave is Night Blooming Jasmine, but Roses aren't too
&gt; shabby either : )
&gt; 
&gt; yes, to most important things first - I can't restrict myself - 
different
&gt; seasons different flowers ..... and here boundless love doesn't put 

on
&gt; weight
&gt; 
&gt; I adore jasmine, but I haven't come across night blooming ones .....
&gt; bouvardia, honeysuckle, freesias, daphne, boronia, lily of the 
valley,
&gt; violets, mock orange blossom, ginger lillies, and yes roses. I 
adore roses,
&gt; not just for their scent, but for their evanescent beauty.
&gt; 
&gt; I live in Tasmania, which is 42 deg south of the equator, so we are 

just
&gt; coming into spring and the air warming and the lots of fragrant 
flowers are
&gt; starting to bloom.
&gt; So
&gt; 1.you look at your food
&gt; 2.you chew your food
&gt; 3. you think about your food
&gt; and then
&gt; 4. you swallow your food
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, absolutely, that is the ideal. It chimes with the scientific 

approach
&gt; too - that we needs to chew at least 30 times each mouthful and 
reduce it to
&gt; a paste full of saliva. That is what the stomach expects and 
prefers.
&gt; Chewing is actually the first stage of digestion.
&gt; 
&gt; What you describe also reminds me of buddhist mindfulness. They 
have an
&gt; exercise which involves eating a sultana, and great practitioners 
of
&gt; mindfulness can get it take 5 mins! It revolves around your 4 
steps - the
&gt; looking, considering, feeling it when you pick it up, feeling the 

movements
&gt; and muscles you use when you pick up the sultana to take it to your 

mouth,
&gt; the sensations in all 5 senses when you put it in your mouth, when 

you start
&gt; chewing ....... etc. I'm sure you get the idea.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that Mr. E is going to appeal to smart people who are
&gt; hoping to better themselves, not some diet guru...so hats off to
&gt; all of us for being those lucky bastards : )
&gt; 
&gt; 'Mr E', I like that. Diane's email about promotional material got 
me
&gt; thinking about a catchy title for Reinhard. I agree re anti-guru, 

but I want
&gt; to also have an expression that acknowledges his importance and 
brilliance.
&gt; I was thinking about 'right on reinhard', which is a bit of a pun 

as well.
&gt; Reinhard and Engels aren't easy names to do catchy things with :)
&gt; 
&gt; And yes, the beauty of No S is its simplicity. But I love it for 
its subtle
&gt; subversiveness. It and the other systems and a big finger at the
&gt; corporatist, materialistic, driven consumer (by the producers) 
society. I
&gt; love it.
&gt; 
&gt; Also I think No S appeals to us cos we've been through the 
destructive
&gt; 'diet' cycle again and again and know the cruel exploitation it is, 

and that
&gt; something else was needed.
&gt; 
&gt; love
&gt; 
&gt; Jen
