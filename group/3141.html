Hey Karen this is Lisa and I totally understand where you are coming from.
Staying home with hungry kids is NO good for you waistline. I have 3 kids,
(3 year old twin girls &amp; 11 month old daughter) and even though I knew
better then to take a bite here and there from their plate....it makes for 
a
heavier mom. Who wants to see food wasted?

Since being on NoS (for about 1.5 months now) I have a &quot;rule&quot; in my 
head
and it helps so much (for me) to have it there. For me it was
snacking/portion control more then anything. I can happily say I'm down 
to
were I was pre-twins. Now that is still heavier then I need to be, but
seeing as I've been pregnant or nursing since 2001, I see that has a
success.

Now I just need to work in the energy to exercise. I know I can do it. 
I
did my first marathon in Jan 2005 (walking it). What a huge accomplishment,
but since then no exercising.

I think for me, I see this as a life style and not a diet. If I fail at
lunch...there is no need to throw my hands up for the rest of the
day....just start over at dinner or even the next day.

Take care, and you can do this,
Lisa

Hi all. I feel so fortunate to have stumbled upon this group. My
name is Karen, I am married with a 15 month old son named Benjamin.
I have been using him as my excuse for not getting back in shape
after the pregnancy. I quit my job when he was born, and this is the
first time I have ever stayed at home for so long. It is so easy to
eat all day long, finishing what he leaves, and then snacking at
night after he goes to bed. My biggest weakness is definately pop.
And loads of sugar. My esteem is slowly slipping, and I hate it that
I can't stand to look at pictures of myself anymore. My husband is
fantastic and I feel blessed and fufilled in many ways. I am ready
to put some focus back on myself and feel better about my body. The
nosdiet just simply makes sense; So here goes.....Day one.
