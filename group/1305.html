Hi Diane,

Thanks for posting this. I do have a cafepress store
ready, just no products:

<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/nosdiet">http://www.cafepress.com/nosdiet</a>

My idea idea is pretty simple: just splash the whole
system (all 14 words) on a bunch of items (plates
would be ideal but it doesn't look like they do them).
Simple as this is, it will take a bit of tinkering to
get it to look like something even the most generously
inclined nosdieter would consider buying. I'd hoped to
get around to this tinkering in August, but then our
little daughter came along.

Do send me your ideas/designs. I think I can put up
multiple types of each product, so we can experiment a
bit. If any sell, I'm happy to split any profit with
the designer, though I imagine it'll be so
insignificant as to not be worth the trouble (hoping
otherwise, naturally).

&gt; Hi all -
&gt; 
&gt; I'm writing to ask all of you to put on your
&gt; thinking caps and help me with
&gt; a worthy project. I have checked with Reinhard
&gt; first about this and he has
&gt; approved the idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Recently someone requested No S Diet &quot;stuff&quot; like
&gt; mugs, T-shirts, etc.
&gt; Reinhard said he had wanted to do something like
&gt; that but it wasn't really
&gt; his thing...but he hoped to get to it soon. I'm
&gt; semi-creative and
&gt; semi-skilled (self-taught) in computer graphics, and
&gt; I've been mulling over
&gt; some ideas ever since then. I know that Cafe Press
&gt; will put anything on a
&gt; T-shirt, mug, mousepad or what-have-you if you
&gt; simply upload your graphics
&gt; and tell them who to donate the (small) commission
&gt; to. (See
&gt; <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/">http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/</a>) 
The money could
&gt; help support the No S
&gt; website, and we'd all feel better about paying top
&gt; dollar for a coffee mug.
&gt; (If anyone knows of a similar site that's better,
&gt; please share.)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm hoping that if this is a good idea, you'll help
&gt; me think of a few
&gt; designs that I can play with. And by the way, if
&gt; any of you is really good
&gt; at this kind of thing or will get it done sooner
&gt; than I will, please
&gt; volunteer! My goal would be maybe three designs
&gt; available through Cafe
&gt; Press within a month. I might not know what I'm
&gt; promising, but I do hope to
&gt; &quot;keep it simple.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; When I say &quot;designs,&quot; I'm imagining some provocative
&gt; text, or catchy motto,
&gt; or a good quote like the one about habits I shared
&gt; recently, coupled with
&gt; the No S logo (or maybe a new variation?), which
&gt; would pique people's
&gt; interest if they see it on our T-shirt, or inspire
&gt; us as we sit at our desks
&gt; wishing for a snack (but not really), virtuously
&gt; sipping tea and
&gt; contemplating the mug.
&gt; 
&gt; I've thought of a few starter-ideas but as I said,
&gt; I'm only SEMI-creative
&gt; and I feel the best method is to ask this big group,
&gt; and pool the creativity
&gt; of many to come up with something really good.
&gt; 
&gt; And once again, if anyone else wants to volunteer
&gt; instead, speak up! My
&gt; life is busy enough already and I'll be happy just
&gt; to buy what you create!
&gt; =)
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; That quote again was...
&gt; --------------------------
&gt; &quot;Habit is either the best of servants or the worst
&gt; of masters.&quot;
&gt; - Nathaniel Emmons
&gt; --------------------------
&gt; Is it catchy enough for the front of a T-shirt, with
&gt; the NoS Diet logo on
&gt; the back? Opinions needed.
