Nols,

Six meals a day *is* better than three. If you can eat
small meals. But then you have to worry about cooking
them, transporting them, etc. etc. In other words, you
stay focused on food ALL the time. Much simpler to eat
like a normal human being. That being said, if you
like dieting as a hobby or as a way of life (for
self-discipline purposes or whatever) help yourself.
Make sure to count calories, because those six meals
are going to be really small. As you can see, counting
calories completely defeats the point of NOS. 

On Shovelglove: having visible abs comes down to two
things: 1) having a low enough bodyfat percentage, and
2) having built-up the abs through work. The
abdominals do have a flexion function (i.e. the one
that is used in crunching) but further, they have a
stabilization function. Stabilization is the main
function of the abdominals, and if you swing around a
heavy sledgehammer for 14 minutes a day, you will
develop this function (i.e. objective #2). In
addition, you'll burn some extra calories that will
help you achieve objective #1. If you're serious
about building up your abs, you shouldn't be doing
crunches, anyway... they're useless. 

On Jared from Subway:

NOS succeeds where Jared's plan is weak: that is, it
allows for variation in the diet. I originally read
about Jared's plan a few years ago in Men's Health,
and they said it was critically low in several
nutrients. The reason for this is that he had the same
stuff for lunch and dinner, every day! Now, he
mastered portion control, but at the cost of
nutrition. The funny thing is, too, if you look at the
guy, he's still kinda rotund. (Skinny fat). He was
getting somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 g of
protein a day... which isn't terribly good for anyone.
The point is, a varied diet is rule #1 for any good
eating plan, and NOS succeeds (at least, insofar as
your natural eating is varied).
