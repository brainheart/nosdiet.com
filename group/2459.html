Studies have actually shown that the weight loss is more if the calcium actually 
comes from dairy. Here's a couple articles. <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/85/98720.htm">http://my.webmd.com/content/article/85/98720.htm</a>

Personally when I started NoS I would occasionally have a glass of chocolate milk 
with breakfast. For me having that bit of chocolate helped me keep from totally 
binging on chocolate later. So it was the lesser of two evils. It is an S though so 
probably should be kept for S days. 

Thats my two cents. :)

chocolate milk, and had cheese at meals.

.....Hi Heidi :)
Chocolate milk is a definite S... just as caloric as a chocolate 
bar... Save that for your s days :)
Well of course the Dairy Industry is going to tout the weight loss 
benefits of milk because thats their product.. As Bonnie wrote, it 
may just be any food which has both calcium and protein...
Almonds are a great source of both, as well as the little canned 
fish sardines :)
You can get calcium from lots of green leafy vege sources...
Kale, and especially seaweed, incase you go for Japanese food...
Good Luck :)
