&gt; &gt; Deb you are killing me with the descriptions of

her.
&gt; 
&gt; ....Good control Jool, maybe next time sidestep the whole issue by 

&gt; taking an alternate route which doesn't include passing 
the &quot;valley

&gt; Yes, thanks to Beignets and Po Boys, plus unlimited evening visits 

&gt; to buy crap at convenience stores, I had a cholesterol level of 
&gt; about 350 after living down there and going &quot;hog wild&quot; for 2 
years.
&gt; When I returned to NY, even when I was still heavy, since my 
dietary 
&gt; intake of fat and sugar was so much less, within one year my 
&gt; cholesterol went down over 100 points, still not perfect, but much 

&gt; less likely to have a coronary....
&gt; 
&gt; Okay a different thread for today. She had a horrible day 
yesterday 
&gt; in school boys making fun of her big breasts and that her teeth 
are 
&gt; &gt; a bit crooked(braces in the spring). Poor thing, 13,5'8 and 
&gt; &gt; 38C,blonde nordic blue eyes. I told her in a few years the boys 

&gt; wont be making fun of her, they will be ogling her. Why do they 
have 
&gt; to be so stupid? 
&gt; 
&gt; ...Why does the sky have to be blue? Kids in general can be 
really 
&gt; hurtful to each other, I wouldn't relive childhood if you paid me.
&gt; Usually, any hurtful criticism is somehow a projection of your own 

&gt; feelings of inadequacy or low self esteem... I asked my son 
Richard 
&gt; what his take on your busty daughters plight was, esp. with regard 

&gt; to your question &quot;why do they (boys) need to be so stupid&quot;, hoping 

&gt; to get an inside scoop from a budding young man, not so completely 

&gt; uninterested in the fairer sex...(he acts so cute in front of the 

&gt; girls in his yoga class, which started 3 weeks ago, he's the only 

&gt; boy. He almost blushes around them!)
&gt; This is what he told me to write to you... The response is a 
classic 
&gt; mix of universal wisdom, and 8 year old knowledge of anatomy...
&gt; He said:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Most people say things about other people, but they are thinking 

&gt; that way about themselves...So those guys must think that they 
have 
&gt; big nipples!&quot; 
&gt; LOL
&gt; 
&gt; Did you ever hear about the kind of guys who flirt with the girls 

&gt; they like by &quot;pulling their pigtails&quot; and other juvennaile forms 

of 
&gt; adoration? Let her know that, most likely, they are just nerdy, 
zit 
&gt; covered, immature morons, who actually just don't know how to 
behave 
&gt; around such obvious beauty, so they act like idiots just to get 
her 
&gt; attention.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a nice weekend :)
&gt; Peace and Love
&gt; Deb

HI Deb, a long weekend spent repairing my daughters ego. You are so 
right about the flirting. I am still laughing over the nipples 
OMG.LOL. she went clothes shopping and was squeezing into a ten. woo 
hoo. she was so excited. was a 13.i am so happy for her.She does 
have alot going for her.Not only beautiful, has a great singing 
voice. still blossoming. She spent some phone time with her big sis 
this weekend and that helped immensely.Heather was picked on for 
being different(happy,smiled alot,petite 5'3):]
I am so sorry you had a rough weekend, that sucks. Glad you are over 
it and on to happier days. I go thru major pms. Have you ever tried 
Indoplex PMS formula. Works very well. A mood lifter without the 
addictions:)I figure i have enough addictions. Plus i only take it 
when DH comments on my mood. Other wise he suffers.I do know that 
the thimmer I am the less i seem to notice it.
Heh does anyone out there know of anything that burns belly 
fat ????? :)). It won't budge.UGH.(besides the obvious of lipo)
Peace and Love to you sister Jools
