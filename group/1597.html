&quot; my kid is suspended from school ...he has developed serious bad 

attitude secondary to failure to properly diagnose and treat 
dyslexia and dysgraphia. i cannot believe that it has taken me to 
the 7th grade with him to finally get a correct diagnosis....&quot;

DF...Hi Donna :)
That is really a frustrating situation...I have personal experience 
with similiar stuff, and yes when it's your childs happiness and 
well being at stake, it can be overwhelming...

&quot;we have been told since 3rd grade that he has a visual/perceptual 

deficiet... ia m beginning to find out that no one would even 
mention dyslexia b/c that means that the school will have to provide 
him with a speech pathologist.&quot;

DF...When my son was between 2-3 the local Barber, to whom I will be 
eternally grateful for his involvement, mentioned that Richard 
didn't seem to say much for his age...He was my first and only son 
and I had nothing to gauge against in terms of an older siblings 
development...I figured this man who cuts kids hair for a living, 
must be mentioning this because he cared and really had enough 
experience with children of that age to have a point...
I listened...It would have been easy to go into denial and cop an 
attitude like some parents might (eg: &quot;where does this guy get off? 

My son is fine&quot;) He even suggested that I go to get his hearing 
checked...Again, I listened and got him tested...It was fine, but I 
decided to go to the Department of Health and have an early 
intervention worker come set us up for an evaluation.
He had about 3 hours of testing and what they found was that, due to 
very loose, and flexible musculature around his mouth and pretty 
much around all of his joints, he wasn't getting the proper input to 
sense himself in the space around him...The term they used 
was &quot;Proprioceptive Disorder&quot; On the cognitive level he was passing 

the Psych abstract/creative thinking tests a year ahead of his age, 
but he was more than a year behind in speaking...The way the first 
speech therapist described it &quot;He doesn't know he has lips a mouth 

or a tongue, because he wasn't getting enough feedback from his 
muscles and joints&quot; This also made sense to me and explained why he 

usually &quot;pummeled&quot; into me when he went for a hug, and loved to 

smash into stuff, get into very tight corners, do fidgety stuff...
He was simply trying to sense himself and needed the input to be 
fairly strong...Yes most children when they are young exhibit much 
of this &quot;hyperactivity&quot; etc...bouncing around, but with Richard 

there was more going on...He got speech therapy for a year and when 
he was preschool age, between me and a very supportive Day care 
owner who fought tooth and nail to make sure they didn't cancel his 
therapy, due to money, he continued to get speech and occupational 
therapy for another year or so...I was lucky Donna, I live in a 
pretty affluent area and there are great services through the 
schools. But I had to fight to get them. You may not have the 
services available to you where you live...Did you ever consider 
going to a teen therapist and a language specialist directly through 
your Health Insurance, if the school won't pay?

If the school is suggesting you put your acting out son into a worse 
school, do *whatever* you can to get some other &quot;specialists&quot; to 

advocate for you. This is your calling. See if a private 
institution with specialists might be able to suggest a better 
route...Adolescence is such a tough time anyway, and acting out is 
part of that stage.., all I can say is try to be as patient as you 
can be and pray alot...Let him know you are on his side, even when 
he is &quot;bad&quot;...He must be very frustrated...I know you are upset that 

he only has received a proper diagnosis by this late, but it is 
still better than never...

Please feel free to share with me directly on my email :)
I hope you find the help you need.
Peace,
Deb
