Hi Lee,

&gt; I made it though my first day. I can't believe I
only &gt; ate 3 meals. 
&gt; Big ones but only 3.

Happy to hear you made it through your first day
without any fudging! Pay in strict willpower up front
and you'll reap the dividends of habit that much
sooner.

&gt; On the S days what would a snack be. Anything I
&gt; want? Since this 
&gt; weekend will be my first S days I am sure I will eat
&gt; more than I 
&gt; should. I can have seconds also?

Technically, S days are rule free. You can have
snacks, seconds, whatever you want. Yes, this gives
you plenty of rope to hang yourself with, and yes, the
first few weekends will probably be excessive (you are
right to budget patience), but with a little attention
and good non-S habits carrying over, I find my S-days
are better than my pre-nosdiet ordinary days. As I've
mentioned in previous posts, I like to plan a limited
but highly desired treat to keep excesses in line.
Keep the tubs of ice cream etc. out of the house.

Hi Max,

&gt; I eat so early in the morning then I have class then

&gt; Im hungry . . . Do you think eating pretzels or
&gt; animal crackers that are both low in fat would be
ok.

Tom's answer was right on. Unless your schedule is
such that you have to wait 8 hours between meals or
something, I'd strongly recommend just eating a big
breakfast to get you through. Once you start snacking
it gets very difficult to stay in control, or even
have a precise idea what is going on. Also, charming
as animal crackers are, and delightful to eat on
S-days, as Tom points out, they're empty calories. No
thinks stuff like that is a good idea, except maybe
the (thoroughly discredited) &quot;fat is the only evil&quot;
crowd. If you decide that rules-be-damned, you must
snack, there are fruits that are as
sturdy/compact/portable as a box of crackers, like
apples. 

*******************************************************

Welcome, and good luck to you both,

Reinhard

&gt; This is my first day. This sounds so crazy it makes
&gt; sense. I will 
&gt; be patient with myself.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This morning I found I ate a bigger breakfast than
&gt; usual (on one 
&gt; plate) scared I wouldn't make it until lunch.
&gt; 
&gt; Wish me luck.
