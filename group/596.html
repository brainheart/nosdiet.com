Hi everyone! I'm Jeanette and I am new to No S and this group. I found
the No S site and was so excited to start. I have been on all kinds of
&quot;plans&quot; since having my third baby 2 years ago with no success. 
The
whole diet, feel deprived, binge, feel bad about it, binge some more,
vow to start new plan on Monday.....argh! What a vicious cycle! Needless
to say I have lost and regained the same 10 pounds over the last 2
years! LOL! I would love to lose about 30 pounds total - this would get
me back to my pre-pregnancy weight. And I thought I was chunky at this
weight before having babies! LOL! Not so - it was a healthy weight for
me. I exercise a LOT so I have that part down. I think No S will really
work for me as a TON of my calories were coming from late-night sweets
and snacks! And I like that these things will be allowed some days, too. 

I started &quot;officially&quot; Monday after playing around with it some 
last
week. I thought I would be DYING in between meals but I really am not.
And he is right - if you know you only have 3 meals for the day you WILL
make them count! LOL! Not that I am stuffing myself at meals, but I am
eating nice, balanced meals with yummy and healthy foods. 

Can't wait to start seeing results! :)
Like I said, I ate at night a LOT so this will substantially lower my
caloric and sugar intake! 

Jeanette
