dear deb

thanks for responding to my first post ..... and so thoughtfully too :) 
it
is great to get feedback :)

what is your favorite fragrant flower?
My personal fave is Night Blooming Jasmine, but Roses aren't too
shabby either : )

yes, to most important things first - I can't restrict myself - different
seasons different flowers ..... and here boundless love doesn't put on
weight

I adore jasmine, but I haven't come across night blooming ones .....
bouvardia, honeysuckle, freesias, daphne, boronia, lily of the valley,
violets, mock orange blossom, ginger lillies, and yes roses. I adore roses,
not just for their scent, but for their evanescent beauty.

I live in Tasmania, which is 42 deg south of the equator, so we are just
coming into spring and the air warming and the lots of fragrant flowers 
are
starting to bloom.
So
1.you look at your food
2.you chew your food
3. you think about your food
and then
4. you swallow your food

Yes, absolutely, that is the ideal. It chimes with the scientific approach
too - that we needs to chew at least 30 times each mouthful and reduce it 
to
a paste full of saliva. That is what the stomach expects and prefers.
Chewing is actually the first stage of digestion.

What you describe also reminds me of buddhist mindfulness. They have an
exercise which involves eating a sultana, and great practitioners of
mindfulness can get it take 5 mins! It revolves around your 4 steps - the
looking, considering, feeling it when you pick it up, feeling the movements
and muscles you use when you pick up the sultana to take it to your mouth,
the sensations in all 5 senses when you put it in your mouth, when you 
start
chewing ....... etc. I'm sure you get the idea.

I believe that Mr. E is going to appeal to smart people who are
hoping to better themselves, not some diet guru...so hats off to
all of us for being those lucky bastards : )

'Mr E', I like that. Diane's email about promotional material got me
thinking about a catchy title for Reinhard. I agree re anti-guru, but I 
want
to also have an expression that acknowledges his importance and brilliance.
I was thinking about 'right on reinhard', which is a bit of a pun as well.
Reinhard and Engels aren't easy names to do catchy things with :)

And yes, the beauty of No S is its simplicity. But I love it for its subtle
subversiveness. It and the other systems and a big finger at the
corporatist, materialistic, driven consumer (by the producers) society. 
I
love it.

Also I think No S appeals to us cos we've been through the destructive
'diet' cycle again and again and know the cruel exploitation it is, and 
that
something else was needed.

love

Jen
