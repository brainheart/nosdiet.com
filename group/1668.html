I live in Britain and have a wonderful General Practitioner who cares for 
me
brilliantly with all my problems. I cannot imagine needing to see a so
called &quot;Really good doctor &quot;privately, because no-one could do better 
for
me than my GP. My 86 year old ,far from wealthy mother lives in another 
part
of the country and also has a wonderful GP.Last year I was in hospital for 
a
while and very well cared-for.Our system in Britain is imperfect and there
are undoubtedly some less good doctors.My Godmother always saw a doctor
privately and when she became ill and died in my parents' home,I had to 
call
her doctor and inform him that she had been suffering from lung cancer,
which he had failed to diagnose.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, the healthcare system is far from perfect but the
&gt; point remains is how is the best way to fix things?
&gt; Government intervention will most likely be needed at
&gt; some level through legislation i.e. - tax credits or
&gt; stipends for employee health care and individual
&gt; insurance plans and limits on malpractice settlements
&gt; , but how much can we rely on the government to REALLY
&gt; fix things. If you think putting up with the long
&gt; lines at the DMV or the social security office are a
&gt; pain in the neck imagine trying to sit around waiting
&gt; for a doctor while you have a bad cold or the flu in a
&gt; place like that.Ever taste &quot;goverment cheese.&quot; And the
&gt; fact remains that in countries where healthcare is run
&gt; by the government you pay through the nose to get
&gt; private treatment from a REALLY good doctor and
&gt; usually only the wealthiest can afford that.
&gt;
&gt; The fact remains that many doctors, lawyers and
&gt; insurance companies are killing the goose that is
&gt; laying the golden egg through plain old fashioned
&gt; greed and stupidity.
&gt;
&gt; That all being said, one of the reasons people are on
&gt; this board is to improve their own health and although
&gt; we cannot cure all sorts of diseases without a doctor,
&gt; eating sensibly and exercising may be the ultimate
&gt; lesson for us all to follow is we want to avoid having
&gt; to go to a doctor in the first place. Obesity rates
&gt; and the related illesses are at an all-time high and
&gt; that is overtaxing an already strained healthcare
&gt; system. There is something a doctor cannot help us
&gt; with and that is effort on our part.
