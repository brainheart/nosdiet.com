Hi Kitrin,

I don't think Melanie was intending to &quot;preach,&quot;
though I understand why you might think so. I don't
ask that people hide or compartmentalize their
religious views (or lack of them), but let's be civil,
OK? The last thing anyone wants to read about here is
a religious war. I've heard they get even uglier than
wars about aspartame. Melanie, this might be a good
time to turn the other cheek and not respond...

Sincerely hoping this thread ends here,

Reinhard

&gt; &gt; D's posting with this subject line had little to
&gt; do with religion. 
&gt; &gt; this one does. if you are thoroughly convinced of
&gt; the lack of a 
&gt; god 
&gt; &gt; or the inefficacy of prayer, then you can
&gt; blissfully ignore the 
&gt; rest 
&gt; &gt; of this post. i think the majority of you may
&gt; benefit from it. 
&gt; &gt; some people can drop a few pounds successfully by
&gt; &quot;putting their 
&gt; &gt; mind to it.&quot; i have relatively few pounds to
&gt; lose, but my weight 
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt; an issue that has plagued me for years. i've also
&gt; got youth on my 
&gt; &gt; side. i came to the conclusion awhile back that i
&gt; am incapable of 
&gt; &gt; losing this weight by my own strength. for those
&gt; with a lot more 
&gt; &gt; weight to lose and who have ingrained bad habits a
&gt; lot longer than 
&gt; i 
&gt; &gt; have, i can imagine that you would find it even
&gt; more difficult. if 
&gt; &gt; you look at any 12 step program- AA, overeaters
&gt; anonymous, etc., 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; first step, i think, is to acknowledge your
&gt; dependence on a higher 
&gt; &gt; power. i expect that even with complete faith and
&gt; openness to God, 
&gt; &gt; the process will still be trying and long. 
&gt; although i am not 
&gt; &gt; yet a weight-loss &quot;success story,&quot; i have seen
&gt; prayer work in 
&gt; &gt; amazing ways in other parts of my life. i am
&gt; actually greatful for 
&gt; &gt; this particular struggle, because it forced me to
&gt; turn to God and i 
&gt; &gt; am more committed to my faith. maybe it was part
&gt; of His plan. 
&gt; &gt; maybe not. give prayer a try. i don't think Zeus
&gt; will strike you 
&gt; &gt; down with a thunderbolt for asking.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In my reply I was trying to find something I could
&gt; compare the need 
&gt; for flexibility to and was expressing why and how i
&gt; had to flex my S 
&gt; days.
&gt; If I really wanted to be preached at about prayer
&gt; and my weight at 
&gt; the same time I would have called my mother thank
&gt; you very much.. I 
&gt; am sure YOUR beliefs are fine for YOU but I do not
&gt; come to this group 
&gt; for prayer advice. I came here to lose weight which
&gt; I am doing since 
&gt; I stick to the basics and do not try to complicate
&gt; myself in calorie 
&gt; counts and fat grams and what is a healthy snack. I 
&gt; eat my three 
&gt; squares a day and none of them involve &quot; grace
&gt; before meals&quot;.
&gt; This does not make me an ungrateful person; just my
&gt; beliefs and 
&gt; theories on the world do not mesh with yours and I
&gt; will thank you 
&gt; very much to not preach at me anymore
&gt; 
&gt;
