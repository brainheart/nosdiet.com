&gt;

&gt; on diet #1.=A0 It is fully compatible with &quot;No S&quot; lifestyle, and 
I=20

&gt; When you have a &quot;setback&quot; don't let it bring you down, instead
&gt; embrace it, welcome it, be proud of it...
&gt; Only people going somewhere have setbacks,
&gt; Successful people have setbacks,
&gt; Setbacks are for people on their way to a better place.
&gt; You will keep moving forward if you think of them that way, so don't=20

&gt; Good luck to all and I am happy to be sharing this experience with 
you!

&gt; &gt;Hello Everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Welcome all of you new comers. I am very proud to say 
th=
at I
&gt; &gt;have been on Nos for almost a month now. I am really enjoying 
the
&gt; &gt;level of control that I have over what I chose to put in my body. 
I
&gt; &gt;truly believe in the lifestyle change.What I have really noticed 
is
&gt; &gt;that I use to eat so much to where the only time I thought I was
&gt; &gt;full was when I was completely stuffed. Now I only eat three meals 
a
&gt; &gt;day, one plate per meal and I am satisfied. I still cannot believe 
I
&gt; &gt;am doing this. The only other time in my life where I was able 
to
&gt; &gt;eat only three meals a day and no snacks was in military bootcamp,
&gt; &gt;which by the way was when I was in the best shape of my life.
&gt; &gt;Remember the system works only if you work it. I am really=A0 happy 
I
&gt; &gt;found Nos!!!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Good luck to all,
&gt; &gt;Mike
&gt; &gt;
