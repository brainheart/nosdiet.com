Right - Starbucks..... the fat and caloric intake of a Starbucks or 
Panera non fat cafe mocha is not bad.... It's 170 calories - only 5 
from fat....
A cafe latte non fat is 120 calories and 0 fat calories....
This of course is without whipped cream! :c)

So - that's not so awful, is it??
Because I do these drinks once in a while - used to be every single 
day - sometimes a couple of times a day... but this week I think I 
have had one. Has it done any good? All of this cutting out I have 
done? No, I still feel fat. I just hid my scale last night but hadn't 
lost a pound :c(
Well, I'm not quitting - I'm sticking this out for the next 3 weeks 
like you all said - and maybe forever, since this isn't extreme to me 
at all... I'm going to be very careful on weekends too - since this 
really is similar to how I've been eating forever now... :c)

&gt; &gt; I've been doing nos a little over a year. I drank a
&gt; &gt; big cup of coffee every morning - it got 
&gt; &gt; into a habit. I see no problem with it - it's just a
&gt; &gt; big cup. I don't put sugar in it and don't 
&gt; &gt; believe in lowfat milk, whole milk, or half and
&gt; &gt; half. I believe in doing it right - I use only 
&gt; &gt; heavy whipping cream. Anything else is water.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for posting this. I drink my coffee black (and
&gt; strong), usually, but that's mostly because I like it
&gt; that way. I don't pretend there's a huge health/weight
&gt; loss benefit in doing this, and when I do put
&gt; something in, it's something real. The amount of time
&gt; people obsess about the tiny little splash of milk or
&gt; the couple sugar cubes in their coffee seems totally
&gt; disproportionate to me. Especially when they wolf down
&gt; half an Entenmann's cake at midnight to make up for
&gt; this little virtue. You'd have to pour a *lot* of
&gt; cream and sugar in your coffee to get anywhere near
&gt; the caloric content of a coke. Keep the focus on the
&gt; egregious offenders. If you feel the need to knock out
&gt; coffee calories and are capable of making this
&gt; sacrifice, great. But that's bonus at best. You
&gt; shouldn't be worrying about bonus unless you've got
&gt; the basics down.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to undercut the resolve of successful
&gt; dieters, no-s or otherwise, who have knocked out cream
&gt; and sugar in their coffee. If this is you, great,
&gt; you're a champ. But I do want to warn those who are
&gt; having trouble sticking to the basics that stuff like
&gt; this can be a dangerous distraction. If you're wolfing
&gt; down coffee cake as a midnight snack, it doesn't
&gt; really matter what you put in your coffee.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: by coffee I don't mean the candy drinks they
&gt; serve at starbucks and dunkin donuts (&quot;frappe
&gt; mochachino,&quot; &quot;coolata,&quot; etc). These are essentially
&gt; coffee flavored milkshakes. If this is what you mean
&gt; by cream and sugar, then yes, it's a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, don't expect 3 lbs a week. My advice, don't
&gt; &gt; expect anything. Just do it.
&gt; 
&gt; Amen. That's the secret of this diet: there is no
&gt; secret. You just have to do it. Don't worry &quot;will it
&gt; work?&quot; It'll work as long as you do. And it's not that
&gt; hard. The hardest part is resisting the sneaking (and
&gt; erroneous) suspicion that there is a solution out
&gt; there that does not involve work.
