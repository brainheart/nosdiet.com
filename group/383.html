Hi, Saleta,

It sure is great when you get the hang of it, then it comes naturally, u some how now 
what and how to eat. I was doing very ok and almost got to my ideal weight. I noticed 
that taking out more Carbs from my diet helped my digestive system. So I mixed a 
little bit of Atkins and the no s. Sadly I have put on 2kg. But now I now where my 
problem is coming from

Cause I taught I had mastered the act of eating properly by depriving my self when I 
get to the s days I over eat. and so has been the circle. Which I have broken today. 
I am not discouraged because I know I can do it. 

Take care all, Thanks for your emails
Chyna.

Jason,
Yes, it makes perfect sence! Slow and steady wins the race! I 
agree whole heartedly. The no s diet is not just a diet it's a 
lifestyle change. Bad habbits like popping sweets into our mouth 
willy nilly, filling our plates as many times as our heart desires, 
and snacking on things just because they are there not because we 
are physiclly hungry are abolished in turn creating a healthier 
leaner us. It's a total package deal and I am loving it. I also love 
that I am not obssessing over food! Another person posted about 
their family was on the Atkins diet and all they did was talk about 
food and fixateon what they could and could not have. No counting, 
no points, just plain old common sence. It's great!
Saleta
