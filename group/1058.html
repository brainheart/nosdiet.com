&gt; Congratulations on the 10 lb. loss!! How long did it take you to 
lose it? The No &quot;S&quot; starts today for me. It will be a little bit 

harder because my parents surprised the whole family (they live in 
Florida, we live in Michigan) and came up to the family party on 
Saturday. Just strolled right in!! ;-) Anyhow, they are here for a 
week so there will be lots of family get togethers this week. I will 
just need to be more conscious of what I eat when, etc.

Thank you

it has been two to two and a half months now.( maybe three i would 
have to go back and look). i am not tracking that closely.. and only 
weighing myself every few weeks.
I am not counting calories, worrying about carbs, figuring out my 
foodgroups or weighing foods. WHAT A BONUS! I still eat some 
desserts like yogurt with stuff stirred in.. or fruit dipped in 
peanutbutter. Yeah i slip from time to time, but my body is getting 
very use to three squares a day and some walking. Healthier food 
choices are starting to come more naturally too. It is not as if i do 
not like healthy food it is just that unhealthy stuff was always at 
the ready before.

Tonight i even went to a buffet and only had one plate. It was a 
large plate, but i only had one, and avoided the fried foods.... and 
skipped the dessert table that came with the price of the meal.. a 
big thing for a penny pincher like me.

good luck this week kim
