Deborah,
All fast food restraunts have nutritional information for their products
listed on their websites. Go look up your favorite fast foods and read 
the
info listed. When I see numbers like 850 calories and 42 grams of FAT (and
that is just for the burger)... it is easy to stay away!!! :)

Subway has a great 6&quot; turkey club with only 280 calories and just a 
little
bit of fat. It's loaded with lots of great veggies. When I'm on the run,
that's where I head for something quick to eat. Chick-fil-A also has a
sandwich that is low in calories, especially if you ask them to NOT toast
the bun. And if you are watching your glycemic index, then you can ask 
for
the chicken patty without the bun (since it is white bread instead of
wheat).

It's not that you can never eat at a fast food place. It is a matter of
educating yourself so you can make better choices where to go and what 
to
ask for. :) If it is your special day and you choose to have an 1800
calorie lunch (burger, fries, shake), then go ahead. Just keep it for
special days like the program says and you will be fine.

Go to your calendar now and circle the next special day that you will treat
yourself to your big mac. Look forward to that day. If you plan for it
now, then maybe it will help you so that your big mac attacks don't over
take you in the mean time. Set a goal to not eat one until the day arrives
that you circled on your calendar.

I know you can do it! :) Holler if you need help.

Hello,
I think I am addicted to fast food. Has anyone else ever experienced
multiple big mac attacks and been able to overcome the addiction? Thanks
for any help you can give me.
