HI Everyone, WEll here i am in my office again, knowing i gained 
weight over the weekend. It started wed, night with KFC,which 
bloated me and I felt horrible Thursday am. Ate very little til 
lunch at 2pm then it all just went down hill from there. My MIL 
cooked ala Emeril :)and it was incredible to say the very least.I 
have been eating at her table for 21 years and that had to have been 
the best meal she has ever prepared. Of course she sent me home with 
platters of food, a whole pie and a cake(from DH birthday)(yes we 
had a double S day)OMG.WE started at 2pm and left around 8 still 
nibbling. Of course we had to eat the LO on Friday, sandwiches at 
lunch and full dinner later. Pie that night. Saturday being an s day 
i hit the caramels and had an extreme sugar high. Scary :O, Dinner 
out that night at Flemings for steaks. as you can see it was an all 
out pig out weekend :O oink oink. I had to force myself to stop 
eating last night. limiting myself to one bowl of chili and 2 corn 
muffins and no sweets last night. So after four weeks on this diet i 
can truly say that it has changed me for i feel awful with the 
previous bad habits coming back.I cant wait to feel in control gain 
and less full. So far so good today, and i think i am going to start 
slashing along with you Deb.Haven't really felt the need to before. 
But i think it will be eye inspiring.:)
Tootleloo &amp; Love Jools
