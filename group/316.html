 &gt; horses, he began to like the taste of oats. All his ailments
&gt; cleared up and he said he never felt better.

I was just thinking that the steel cut oats don't sound much different 
than
the recleaned racehorse oats you can get at the feedstore. And they only
cost $11 a 50 lb bag. A coffee grinder or processor and you'd be in
business :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Also, people who work with their hands for a living, like farmers,
&gt; for example, don't have time to graze all day long.

Not in this day and age -- trust me, farmers are just as fat as everyone
else now. A hundred years ago, it was certainly different and physical
labor was intense. Now, when that $250,000 combine breaks down, you wait
for the service rep to come fix it :)

Anyone watch the PBS documentary called Frontier House? It was where they
took 3 families and had them live in Montana like it was 1883. (Actually
lots of it was how our family lives in 2004, so we laughed at them alot)
The men lost something like 40-50 lbs each. One thought he was seriously
ill to be so &quot;gaunt&quot; -- he wasn't -- he was simply a healthy 
weight.
Interestingly, they were all at what was considered an average weight for 
a
man in that time era. Compared to current times, they were lean!
