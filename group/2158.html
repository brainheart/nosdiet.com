....Good for you Jool! And hey, thanks for sharing that I am not the 
only person who has sat on their remote, oblivious to it! LOL. 
Well, in my defense, if you look at the neurological &quot;map&quot; of the 

human body, called the &quot;homunculus&quot; or &quot;little man&quot; it shows that 

most of our sensory nerves are in high concentrations in the fingers 
(roughly 50,000 per square inch!) and in our *mouths*! And the least 
innervated parts of us (just motor/sensory, not the internal 
organs), is the legs and butt! We simply don't feel as much there :)
So we are at a disadvantage, because, in a way like Navin described, 
the relative mass of our heinies could skyrocket and we might not 
feel it until way too late! LOL
And then we might *never* find that remote!
Hey remember that gross scene in Austin Powers, when they plant the 
tracking device on &quot;Fat Bastard&quot;? so gross! LOL

How is Richard dong after 
&gt; his last murphy incident ??neck okay? We are hard at work on our 
&gt; remodeling project so will talk to all on monday.
&gt; TTYL Love Joolio

....Good luck on your project, you are like a real life &quot;renovate my 

family&quot;...that's cool!(ooh I lust over the head foreman on that 
show! LOL)
Thank you very much for your concern, and asking about Richard! You 
are a nice poyson :)
He is much better... I actually took him for a chiropractic 
adjustment by my chiro-partner/landlord, Robert... I work in his 
office, in my own separate little &quot;massage sanctuary&quot; aka room 
:)
Richard has complete trust in me, and I have complete trust in 
Robert, having gone to him several times this year, and without any 
exceptions, *always* walking out feeling relief and improved 
mobility. He is a total pro, and he helped Richard immensely..
I had Richard write and decorate a little thank you card to Robert 
and yesterday he called and said he had received it and that it was 
very &quot;funny cute&quot; :) He doesn't normally treat youngsters...
I was proud of how brave Richard was...My own feeling is that since 
we are such strong role models and can exert very good influences on 
our kids, why wait till they won't listen, or are already in trouble.
I would much rather Richard use natural means of healing than get to 
be another &quot;pain killer popping&quot; person... Our bodies have the 

capacity to heal themselves, and not many people understand how, but 
I really believe in homeopathic remedies and wholistic healing.
Again, thanks for asking Jools
Love,
Deb
