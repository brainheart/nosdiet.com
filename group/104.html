I stumbled upon this site today through ask jeeves. I don't remember 
the question I had, but it wasn't even about weight loss. I decided 
that this may very well be the way I've been looking for to loose 
weight all this time. I've gained ~60 pounds in the last 4 years, 
most being in the last 2 years. The other night I decided I was 
going to stop drinking pop like I do...Which is constantly. It's 
hard since I get it free at work, and the bottled water here has a 
significant amount of sodium, so you just end up more thirsty after 
drinking it, but I'm gonna do it. This is just one step up for me, 
and I'm pretty sure I can handle most of it right off the bat, and 
all of it soon. Thanks for making this availible.

Now for a question that I know has been addressed, but not &quot;to my 

satisfaction.&quot; Breakfast, I wake up litterally 2 minutes before I'm 

supposed to be at work, and it's a 20 minute drive. (yes I'm late 
every day, but that's a whole 'nother story) Nutrigrain bars and pop 
tarts have been a Godsend to me. Not only that but I'm a VERY picky 
eater, and most common breakfast foods are not to my liking. I do 
love a good bowl of Cheerios or something like that, but I frankly 
don't have the time for them. Toast is great, english muffins 
too...but every day? I don't think I'd like that...Any other ideas 
out there...Maybe there was some of this addressed, and I either 
glanced over it or missed it in the archive, sorry if it is just a 
repeat. Thanks for the help!!

Kevin
