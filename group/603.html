Reinhard,
Thanks for the welcome! :)

That is funny you mention it, because I was just about to post to the
list how much more I am ENJOYING eating since starting!! I have really
been making my meals count since I know I only have 3 each day. Instead
of picking the first thing I can get my hands on, or stressing out about
calories, etc. I have been eating nice, YUMMY, well-balanced meals. I
love delaying things just a bit....especially the sweets.....gives me
something to look forward to. LOL! Having something to look forward to
always makes life a little more fun. When you can eat a candy bar
anytime you want it's not as enjoyable. I am truly loving eating again!
:)

I also think forgiving yourself when you slip up and moving on is key. 
I
had a slip last night (eek) on only day 4 of this, but it's ok. I
learned from it and am back on track with (3!) healthy meals today. I
used to have the &quot;what the heck, I already screwed up...&quot; attitude but 
I
am trying to get over that. Looking at the big picture, one slip isn't
going to ruin my progress, as long as I stop right there and turn it
around. 

I LOVE No S! :)

BTW, a friend of mine who I just turned on to No S and I were talking
the other day. I was saying that back in the 1950's when snacking
between meals was considered &quot;bad&quot; for you, people were just NOT 
obese
like they are now. Not saying that snacking is bad for you physically,
just unnecessary! 

Jeanette
