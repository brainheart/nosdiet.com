First, how does this email dealie work? You send an email, as you did, 

to the  and anyone and everyone who signed up for 
the group recieves the email, some once per day (it collaberates them 
all into one email) some get each individual email. So if you ask 
questions...There's plenty of people out there to see and reply to your 

questions....With much insight, including the creator of the diet, 
Reinhard. Hope that answers that.
I really dont' have a reply to your question about lunch...That's a 
tough one...Everyone always says to eat slow to enjoy your meal, 
especially when dieting. (I wouldn't know...I hold a record of being the 

fastest eater at work, and in my circle of friends). But stay away from 

the pop and chips...Try a bottle of water and something 
not-chippy...Though chips don't fall under taboo if that's your lunch in 

this diet (correct me if I'm wrong) they're frowned upon if that's all 

you eat...but they're not an S technically. I personally have found 
making sandwiches a godsend...They dont' take long to make in the 
morning/night before...Different breads, toast, different 
fillings...They're easy and quick. I make a little flub by using jelly 

occasionally...Peanutbutter and Jelly, sometimes just peanutbutter, 
often turkey..Either left over from a breast I cooked for my dinner one 

night, or deli slices. That's about it for me, but since I'm such a 
picky eater, that's good enough for me. Pack some lettuce in a seperate 

back, or a few slices of sandwich stacker pickles...you've got about the 

same amount of filling as a bag of chips, to me much better tasting, 
same amount of time to eat (yes, added preperation, not much though) and 

so much healthier. So, that's my suggestion. I'm sure you'll hear other 

people's. Good luck!

&gt;Hi:
&gt; 
&gt;I am new to this diet but I do not eat sweets that much anyway maybe once a month 
I want chocolate. my down fall is Coke and chips and really want to know is how diet 
works, because I get a 30min lunch break and I do not eat. The reason I do not eat is 
because I feel I do not have a enough time to sit and enjoy my lunch, I eat slow and 
everybody tells me this, so I grab a soda and chips and another question who does the 
email work I have lots of email from a lot of people and I lots of question

&gt;Hi
&gt;I have had another good day. No sodas and no seconds. I did stick a candy kiss in 
my mouth before I thought and a tiny piece of cheese when I gave my dog a treat. But 
other then that it has been good. Im on my way to eat my dinner then I will be home 
and in bed. I have to get up early for work.

&gt;&gt;The best thing about No S was the simplicity. 
&gt;&gt;Suddenly it's become very complicated with everyone
&gt;&gt;discussing what's good for you and what will kill
&gt;&gt;you. Let's remember what drew us to this diet in
&gt;&gt;the first place. The simplicity. No snacks. No
&gt;&gt;seconds. No sweets. Period.
