&gt; Hi everyone
&gt; Marianne here in Germany
&gt; I have been a silent observer for several months now - some of the 

comments are really amusing, some people seem to be quite enamored 
with their socalled literary creativity

....Gee, everyones a literary critic! LOL :)Just trying to keep the 
conversation &quot;socalled&quot; lively...

&gt; I was hoping you would see your error- here this gal was all 
excited and you really slammed her 

.....This is why I wrote my apology, however, I will say, 
that &quot;slam&quot; is a bit extreme... I went into a negative place, but I 

also offered some kind comments, not in my opinion, a total &quot;slam&quot;

&gt;I know what I am talking about, believe me - so I am glad you have 

corrected yourself and now carry on....
&gt; Marianne

....Pardon me Mariane, I seem to have offended you more than little 
ol'Jeanette (and again Jeanette, feel free to tell me I am a big 
poopie pants for that first &quot;dumb letter&quot; I'll say it again, it was 

an unthoughtful comment and I'm sorry it even got posted! Mea 
Culpa!! :)
I *will* continue to &quot;carry on&quot; and would have anyway... I am an 

unstoppable force! LOL :) I will end this letter saying that two 
wrongs don't make a right....If you feel happier now that I have 
been scolded, for my &quot;slamming&quot; and &quot;socalled literary&quot; writing, 

then I'm glad it's off your chest...
It is easy to judge others...I realized that on my own, thank you 
very much...I can only be an authority on my own feelings, and not 
other peoples...I also believe in forgiveness and compassion when 
someone makes a mistake...I corrected myself and said I was 
sorry.....
Peace,
Debbie
