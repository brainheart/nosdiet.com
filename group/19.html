Angie,
Howdy! Welcome to the NoSDiet! I've been on Reinhard's plan for
about a year now. I started the NoSDiet because I used to be a
sugar-holic and I'd snack all the time. I spend all day in front of
a computer and to deal with stress, I'd snack on any candy I could
find. It wasn't an uncommon day for me to eat three Snickers bars in
an afternoon plus any other sweet I could find. Like you, I'm able
to eat snacks/sweets guilt-free on the weekends now. It's great! As
an added bonus, I've found that I appreciate sweets much more now.
It really is like a drug. I would need more
sugar/chocolate/ice-cream to satisfy that craving and I was out of
control. I used to wonder how the heck a half cup of ice-cream was a
single serving! Now, I feel content after a small ice-cream and I
definitely enjoy the taste more. Plus, I don't crave sugar in the
afternoons like I used to. I've also noticed that I don't tend to
have that 3:00pm slump like I used to.

As far as breakfast goes, that's a tough one for me. I'm often
running a bit late in the morning, so I used to skip that meal a lot.
Now, I force myself to take the few extra minutes to sit down and
enjoy a good breakfast. I'm not a huge fan of the &quot;healthy&quot; cereals
either; however, I've found a couple that are quite good. Give your
local health/whole foods store a try. You might find something
tasty. For a while, I was eating steel-cut oats with little bits of
dried fruit/trail mix added. The oats take about 30 minutes to
prepare. It was perferect timing: as soon as I got up, I would put
the oats on the stove to cook. By the time I showered and got
dressed, they were ready. Mostly, I eat toast made out of a heavy
bread (such as a hearty whole wheat or something with grains in it.)
I figure the loaf of bread should weigh about the same as a brick! I
also highly recommend the butter that Reinhard mentioned: Plugra.
It's really tasty! In addition to toast, I sometimes will have an
egg or two or some yogurt. Also, fruit everyday. I love fruit!

Keep us posted on your progress. I think it might also be kind of
fun for all of us to keep a little journal of our meals for a few
days/week and post them.

&gt; That is my word to describe you, my new German librarian cat-loving
&gt; best friend. (Obsessed, perhaps a word for me...jk). Seriously. I
&gt; feel as though I should begin by saying, &quot;Hi, my name is Angie, 
and
&gt; I'm a foodaholic.&quot; You could welcome me and THEN I get to report
&gt; that it's been five, FIVE days since my last beloved CocaCola, that 
I
&gt; am now not only caffiene-free, but SODA-free. I ate a few snacks
&gt; yesterday without guilt, something I haven't experienced since
&gt; childhood, and today I am SO on the wagon. I've been doing the
&gt; NOSDiet for less than a week, so yes, I'm still perhaps a little
&gt; overenthusiastic. My next step is to rid my pantry of all the little
&gt; sugary snacks that have been begging me to binge, the snacks that 
my
&gt; children and husband adore but need to be gone. Wish me luck. For
&gt; today, know that I am feeling successful, I am SO loving you and your
&gt; no-nonsense free program, and I'm recruiting! :)
