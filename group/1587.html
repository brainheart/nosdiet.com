Hi Noessers :)
I have had a very very very stressful last two months...My office is 
in it's infancy and any first year business person will tell you 
that this period can be like hell...Well, anyway with *all* of the 
stress (ie: having to move out of my apartment and back with parents 
even though I am an adult, having every single bill that I have 
overdue, trying to stay positive and &quot;go for it&quot; anyway...You get 

the picture, and I'm sure I'm not the only person in this country 
with financial worries) and having been sick with a cold for about 
two weeks, plus my eight year old too...This was a potentially binge 
producing time, where if I wasn't doing NoS I would probably put on 
between 5 to 7 lbs just due to stress eating, and lack of activity.
But I am holding fast with my 6 lbs down and I consider this an 
amazing triumph...When I stepped on the scale for the first time in 
about two weeks, I won't lie, I was really worried and scared that 
maybe my little loss might have been erased.. It was not...I am so 
happy about this, and so relieved :)
My mom went to Costco the other day and came home with industrial 
sized everything, lol.
She bought a 3 lb bag of individually wrapped string cheese for, 
presumably my son Richard, and I noticed something really great when 
I picked it up...
That was one big giant chunk of cheese. When I thought about it, 
cheese is primarilly milk fat, so here I was, holding up and staring 
at a physical representation of what 3 pounds looks and feels like.
It was a big honkin' slab...If everyone who feels bad that they 
don't lose 20 lbs in five minutes would just go out and pick up a 
huge 3 lb costco bag of string cheese, they might actually feel 
surprised that it is such a substantial amount of fat.
And it helps create a feeling of pride for anyone who is 
losing &quot;small&quot; amounts...On the scale, the numbers don't look so 

great, but in the real world 3 lbs, or 1 or 2 etc...is really alot.
So go to your dairy department when you are sad that you only lost 2 
or 3 pounds and hold a huge chunk of cheese.
Then you may find yourself saying &quot;cheese&quot; and smiling :)
Love,
Deb
