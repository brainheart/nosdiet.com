Dear Dave :) I thought your letter to Donna was very sweet caring 
and proactive, and I'm happy you have found something that works for 
you and helps you in your times of &quot;M&amp;M&quot; need :)
May I add to those ideas? :)
The eating on the run trap, is one that most of us, at one time or 
another, fall into...I agree with you that Donna should try to be 
prepared with a healthy and satisfying &quot;emergency&quot; food, should a 

situation arise, but I am really opposed to eating on the run.
1. Because it doesn't really register. Your mind is still running, 
and it is usually, fairly unconscious, so although you may be 
putting the right fuel into the system, the enviornment is just as 
important to consider when it comes to experiencing a feeling of 
satiety. Maybe this is not what you envisioned anyway, when you 
said &quot;on the run&quot; and that was just lingo for &quot;at work, or 
wherever&quot;
2. Wherever a person may be they can create a safe haven for 
a &quot;meal&quot; and it doesn't need to be a long one...If during a frantic 

day, I have to have food because I waited too long, this is a bad 
setup for mood swings and angry feelings to crop up. But even when 
I am a complete lunatic timewise, and I have to &quot;hurry up and eat 

SOMETHING soon&quot; (actually that happened yesterday, similar scenario, 

I was about 2 hours past due for food, and had just massaged my 
friend/mentor for about 90 mins, which usually gets my appetite 
fired up) I pretend the rest of the world doesn't exist, I sit down, 
I say &quot;thank you Lord&quot; and then I attempt to eat as peacefully as I 

can. Yesterday my very late lunch was a banana, on the run friendly 
food, but I thought of it as a meal and I tried to, for 1 minute, 
stop the mental &quot;running&quot; and just eat my food. If I was at an 

office, I would sit down at my desk, close my eyes, and try to calm 
down before taking that first bite.
Eating and running are an unsatisfying mix.

&gt; From: alexfallsmom@a... [mailto:alexfallsmom@a...] 

&gt; got really busy with some people in really bad shape and i had to 

delay my lunch by 2 hours...i was so hungry by one ish that i 
grabbed some candy...
...Ah Donna, we have all been there you are not alone :) Can you 
prepare yourself for future instances like this with home prepared 
stuff like baby carrots (also a sugar booster, but not the kind 
which will prompt you to mentally go down the drain after) or a 
small pbj sandwich? Like the boyscouts say &quot;Be prepared&quot; :)


i was truly afraid that if i did not eat something that i would 
make an error that i could not afford to make.

...Okay, so now you know that your brain functions best when you 
keep your blood sugar level. This sounds like a stressful job, and 
stress hormones like cortisol floating around in your body will 
wreak havoc on your mood and being...Breathing lowers cortisol, next 
time you feel &quot;afraid&quot; like that, seriously, take several slow, deep 

breaths and see if it helps the situation :)

after that, it was pick, nibble and nosh the rest of my shift. i 
think that i could have handled today better, but after having a 
slip i got a really bad attitude. i am sick and tired of eating bad 
and being fat. i will stop eating for tonight, and tomorrow will be 
a no s day ( or else ! )

....Donna, I am sure that Reinhard would agree that getting into a 
Blood Feud with *yourself* and your appetite is counterproductive to 
success... I'm sorry you felt so crappy after your slipup, but jeez 
you are just beating yourself up and you need to *build yourself up* 
instead :)
I have made this quote in the past so please, all who have already 
seen it, forgive me for being redundant, but I just love the take on 
this, hope it will help you Donna... It was from a Prevention 
Magazine self help tape about weight loss and I am pretty sure it 
was a guy named Mark Brickman, one of the editors of the magazine....

I will paraphrase:
When you have a setback, rather than get mad about it and upset,,,
Welcome it!
That's right. Embrace your setback...Only people who are going 
somewhere have setbacks and it's proof that you are going 
somewhere...
People who don't care about making a change in their lives are the 
ones who don't have setbacks...
If you go into any successful business and visit the executive 
offices, you will find people whose list of setbacks are as long as 
their arms...
So again, rather than get sad about your setback, just try to keep a 
positive perspective, and keep moving forward.
If you try to view these setbacks as evidence that you are on your 
way, maybe you won't feel so bad when they happen. 
&gt;
Threatening yourself by saying &quot;I will do my NoS 'or else' &quot; is just 

negative reenforcement...Try instead, when you are beefing yourself 
up, to think &quot;We are all doing the best we can&quot; and forgive your 

imperfections...Be the best friend you could be to yourself.
None of us would tell you &quot;do this diet *or else*&quot; why should you 

treat yourself with any less respect?
Love,
Deb
