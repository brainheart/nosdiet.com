Hi everyone :)
Even though this is about walking (ie Urban Ranger) that group is as 
sleepy as sleepy hollow, so I decided to stay with the Nossers.

Had such a great outing with Richard this afternoon. We went for a 
walk through a very large woodland park/preserve in our town...Got 
to watch leaves fall, squirrels scamper and chipmunks chatter. Even 
had a moment where we saw Woody Woodpecker himself up in the tree 
tops. 
On our way back I decided that we might as well use our fireplace 
this afternoon to bring a little cheer and warm up the cooling air.
So we actually gathered up wood along the path and trekked through 
till we finally made it back to the car with our bundle of fire 
kindling...Got some pretty nice dry branches and broke them in half 
to fit the fireplace...Came home and got cozy infront of the 
flickering flames, with a bowl of fresh popcorn...Nice break from 
the usual, get home and flip on the tube, so much more relaxing.
Low tech and yet fascinating to watch, and let's face it how much 
longer will I get to hug and cuddle my son before it gets totally 
uncool to him? We have to make this a weekend ritual. Maybe next 
time we'll get some stones and make a pit out there in the woods for 
a campfire, and some S days toasted marshmallows!...What is it about 
fire that is so attractive and soothing?
Between picking up the wood and carrying it about a mile (switching 
arms when I got tired) then breaking it up by hand, carting it away 
etc...I got a little workout too...I felt like I was in some old 
fairy tale or maybe Peter and the Wolf being in the woods. It was 
great.
This is a terrific time to get out and commune with nature. 
Lucky chipmunks!
Hope everyones weekend was fun :)
L&amp;P
Deb
