<pre>
    
Just wanted to share another one of those diet at the dinner table stories.
Yesterday, I invited myself to my parent's for dinner, when I did this, 

my mother invited her sister and brother. It was a nice dinner. I had 
my serving of turkey, corn, salad, and a biscut. My aunt had about the 

same as me, maybe a LITTLE less, but I'm a younger male...So anyway, 
after dinner, my mom pulls out a pie, I turn it down, to all of our 
amazements...I had no want for it at all. Aunt and uncle ask me why, I 

explain that I've cut out sweets from most of my days, that's all. My 
aunt then goes &quot;oh, I'm on the Jenny Creig point system. I normally 

wouldn't get to have this, but I worked out yesterday for an hour and a 

half, so I earned an extra 13 points.&quot; I just smiled and nodded....I 

tried that on the coat tails of someone else...Counting points, 
especially when working, became so hard after the first day....And 
earning points by working out? I didn't get that....I explained to her 

that I had lost weight without even working out with what I'm doing, and 

I don't have to count points...But I'm probably within my own point 
range, just by watchign what I eat, and not over doing it. She was 
interested....I wouldn't be suprised if we didn't find her here soon. 
I don't think that story came out like I was thinking it.....but you get 

my drift..

Take care all
Kevin
