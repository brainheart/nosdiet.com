Hi everyone!

I'm new to post here, but I've read many of the archived posts and 
the website and have to finally chime in with my 2 cents..:)

This is the sanest, most doable, real world &quot;diet&quot; I have ever come 

across. It gives just the right amount of guidelines without going 
overboard. The &quot;S&quot; days are always just around the corner. You can 

actually eat with everybody else, even when going out to eat. Thank 
you, Richard, for not only putting the plan into words, but making it 
free to all. I recommend your website any time the question of diet 
comes up in various forums that I frequent.

As far as how this has worked for me, I recently completed a rotation 
using the Slim in 6 program that I'm sure many of you have seen 
advertised on TV. Let me tell you, the exercises are hard and they 
work! However, the diet that is included with the kit is pretty 
restrictive. You are supposed to start out with a 3-day fast, then 
stick to the old &quot;6-minimeal-a-day&quot; plan, eating only small amounts 

(and of course counting calories on top of it!!!). Ugghh.

About then, I did a Google search on diet (not sure of the exact 
terms) and found the NoSDiet website. I have tried &quot;hunger and 
fullness&quot; approaches to eating before, but as Richard mentioned, they 

left out some restrictions that are needed--I could eat from hunger 
and fullness all day!!

So I started the NoSDiet, combining it with the Slim in 6 exercise 
plan. They worked great together!! I lost 7 pounds in 6 weeks 
(which was my goal), and didn't have to give up eating the foods I 
loved. I recently had an extended &quot;S&quot; time (vacation and camping), 

but am now happily back to the NoS plan.

Sorry this rambled, but I wanted to let everyone know my positive 
experiences with NoS. Hopefully, this will give some encouragement 
to those who wonder if it really works. It worked (and still works) 
for me, and is definitely a plan for life. I'm even trying to 
convince my DH to give it a shot! :)

Thanks for the website and this group, Richard. I'm happy to be 
aboard. :)
