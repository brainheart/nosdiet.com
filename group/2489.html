....Yes Betsy, sugar drinks are a quick weight gainer, sorry you are 
having so much trouble with them... At least you want to change your 
habit, and that's a start :)

&gt;About 2 yrs. ago, I had kidney infection and the dr. took me off 
nearly everything but water. After 2 weeks, I had lost 30 lbs. But, 
I gained all that back after my infection had gone. I just have no 
will power 
.....Betsy, that is serious stuff. I am a licensed massage therapist 
with training in both Western and Eastern methods of evaluation and 
treatment... It is interesting that you say you &quot;have no will power&quot; 

as in Chinese Traditional Medicine all of our vital organs have 
emotional components as well as physical ones and the kidneys are 
the &quot;Seat of the Will&quot;... Clearly that infection zapped alot of your 

inherent &quot;willpower&quot; and maybe the Kidney energy was deficient to 

begin with, resulting in that infection... I would suggest as a 
suppliment to trying the NOS diet out (which would be pretty much 
Cold turkey, can you handle that? :)
Why not find an accredited licensed acupuncturist and see if they 
can help you tonify the energy of your kidneys... There is probably 
an imbalance of the Stomach and Spleen meridians (energy pathways 
where the points lie) as well, as the taste preference associated 
with the Spleen is &quot;Sweetness&quot; (as opposed to sour, bitter, spicy, 

salty)
This is my input as a therapist. I wish you good luck no matter 
what you do and hope you find the support here, or wherever, that 
will help you!
If you have any questions about the issues I brought up, please feel 
free to email me at my regular address.
Peace and Love,
Debbie Feder
