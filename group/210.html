Hi Chloe,

It doesn't surprise me that you've independently come
up with something similar -- it's not all that
complicated, after all. I'm glad you've been doing
well on your version, and hope the nosdiet mnemonics
etc. give you a little something extra.

&gt; Hello all. I found this group and the nosdiet site
&gt; through a link 
&gt; from Amazon regarding a book I put on my wish list,
&gt; &quot;Naked at Noon&quot; 
&gt; about sunlight (I have severe seasonal affective
&gt; disorder and 
&gt; sunbathing and vitamin D/calcium-magnesium have
&gt; helped). 
&gt; 
&gt; Amazing. I had come recently to similar conclusions
&gt; about how to 
&gt; approach food. The alliteration of the S words is a
&gt; great way to 
&gt; remember the principles. I decided I was not
&gt; &quot;dieting&quot; anymore. 
&gt; Dieting kept me morbidly obese and bingeing, always
&gt; feeling deprived, 
&gt; always overeating (because if I couldn't really have
&gt; a verboten food 
&gt; item then I had to eat as much of it as possible
&gt; when I 
&gt; had &quot;transgressed&quot; because I would never be able to
&gt; eat it again). 
&gt; So I just eat no-sugar meals (in fact just purchased
&gt; stevia and use 
&gt; tiny amounts for decaf and occasionally a
&gt; vinaigrette) and on the 
&gt; weekends and special occasions I eat what I want
&gt; (the difference is 
&gt; that because I know the weekend will come again I do
&gt; not binge--I am 
&gt; not compelled to--because I know I can have those
&gt; formerly forbidden 
&gt; items again). After about eight weeks of doing
&gt; this, my blood 
&gt; pressure is down and my clothes are very loose, so
&gt; loose I shall have 
&gt; to go down a size. I haven't weighed yet, but
&gt; will...The scale is 
&gt; under a table currently being used by my houseguest
&gt; whose house 
&gt; burned down in the Paradise Fire in San Diego
&gt; County, and I frankly 
&gt; can't get to it right now, and when I do I will post
&gt; some stats. 
&gt; Looking forward to seeing the progress of everyone
&gt; here, including 
&gt; me, to regain some sanity so we can live and eat in
&gt; the real world.
&gt;
