i never realized i had a problem with &quot;seconds&quot;.. turned out i did.. quite 
strange how i never noticed it..and even stranger how it only took me one day of 
nosdiet to see it...
so how was my first day???
i had 4 meals (no medical condition) and that s the least i could come up with.. i 
absolutely had to starve myself..! ( i am usually closer to 12 meals per day or 
so)..so i consider 4 as starvation.. and &quot;seconds&quot; was an issue too , 
because i never sit down and eat, i just grab something out of the fridge every two 
hours or so... never noticed before that i actually keep walking while eating ( that 
cant be healthy.. can it? )
mum made me a cheeze cake today.. i love it.. i am still fighting the temptation, but 
i wonder if it will still be around on saturday.. he he he..
just kidding.. i am still so motivated about it.. but ofcourse i could consider 
thursday as &quot;sursday&quot; and every &quot;single&quot; day as an 
S-day.......!

and hill, i joined in (for a day and half now) mainly because i could relate to what 
reinhard was saying.. i have these annoying 8-10lbs that i keep gaining over winter 
and lose by summer... so now as winter is almost over i was searching for means to 
shed those lbs (noway summer clothes is gonna see me like this) i put a search on the 
net and it was about the only site that didnt have &quot;and now to get ur personal 
profile u need to pay xx$) sentence... that s why i read on. the part i liked the 
most was the shovel glove part, it didnt need special equipment and seemed quite easy 
and effort - less (turned out it wasnt)... mmm.. i liked reinhard (oops.. adored him 
to be more precise, and i currently am devastated cuz he turned out to be married.. 
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...) anyway , that s why i joined the group and then i kept closely 
watching their emails for 3 weeks or a bit more (makes me sound like a mad stalker) 
before i decided they seemed nice and &quot;normal&quot; .. people&quot;.. people 
just
like me.. who arent obsessed abt their weight

so in short hill ( i know that s the point u like the most because i have this paper 
i am working on right now whose subject is a s vague as &quot;bleeding&quot;.. and i 
just wish that someone gets right to the point and tell me what it s about
anyway, i joined because:
1- no fees involved
2- the diet creator is someone who actually succeeded at it (not some sort of 
dietitian who sits at his desk and tells me what to eat )
3- i liked reinhard s sense of humor, and his ability to clearly put the rules in 
what seemed like a simple uncomplicated way
4- i am in no hurry to lose weight, those 10 lbs are gonna go away by themselves so i 
might as well search for means to stop them from creeping back on next winter (ie 
long term vs rapid results)
5- i really liked the way conversation ran smoothly.. and the fact that reinhard 
still reads them (ie if he wasnt sure it was gonna work for most people, he would 
have abandoned the group )
mm.. that s about all
Dee
