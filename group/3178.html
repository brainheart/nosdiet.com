&gt; To put it in perspective, it's taken me about a year and a
&gt; half to drop 22 lbs, so y'all are at a nice, steady pace.

&gt; It really is amazing how something as simple as &quot;eating less&quot; 

&gt; actually works. :-) 

Nathan, thanks for sharing this (and congratulations!). It's amazing
that the solution for being overweight is both obvious *and* not
unpleasant, and yet people still refuse to believe it. 

Yes, it's slow. But that's intimately bound up with &quot;not unpleasant,&quot;
which is in turn intimately bound up with &quot;sustainable.&quot; The 
change
we're striving to make here is for a lifetime. If it takes a year or
two to reach our ideal, so be it. Better than get there in mere months
only to fall off within that year or two. &quot;Slow expectations&quot; are 
not
low expectations, they're high. I don't think you can realistically
separate the two.

&gt; This is the &quot;hurry up already I want it now!&quot; 
&gt; immature way of viewing weight loss. But as immature, and
downright 
&gt; silly as it is to think this way, it seems to be a very hard 
&gt; argument 
&gt; toresist when basically *everything* in our society is geared 
&gt; towards 
&gt; *NOW NOW NOW*... 

Deb, I don't think it's a coincidence that patience, that stodgiest of
old fashioned virtues, is on the wane, while we wax ever more obese. 

&gt; I 
&gt; myself just had a very annoying few weeks of &quot;doubt&quot;, and if 

&gt; Reinhard 
&gt; hadn't been the great and awesome problem solver he is, I might be 

&gt; flip flopping mentally (yet again) and sucked back into the 
&gt; &quot;desperate dieters mode&quot;...

Deb, I'm happy my pep talk did the trick!

Reinhard
