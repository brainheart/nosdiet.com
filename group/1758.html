&gt; &gt; Well its my first day of nos, its almost 9am and for
&gt; &gt; whatever reason 
&gt; &gt; i am already hungry,
&gt; 
&gt; It's probably psychological: you know you've got to
&gt; hold out and you're afraid you'll be hunger, so you
&gt; start getting anticipatory pangs. I think you'll find
&gt; it's not actually that bad. Just make sure, as Lee
&gt; warns, to give yourself big enough portions to carry
&gt; yourself through. This might mean a bit of excess at
&gt; the beginning. That's ok. Proper &quot;mealing&quot; habits are
&gt; worth a few extra calories up front. It's an
&gt; investment.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Friday is a great day to start
&gt; 
&gt; Yes! Except I find that a lot of newbies get thrown by
&gt; the weekends. They can't actually enjoy them yet, they
&gt; feel guilty. Better than worrying a whole lot about
&gt; eating too much this weekend, you might do better
&gt; trying to find something you especially want to eat.
&gt; Counterintuitive as this is, I think you'll find you
&gt; eat less and enjoy it more.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; this by the way. 
&gt; &gt; I am talking to my 13yo daughter about this and
&gt; &gt; hoping to convince 
&gt; &gt; her to join me. 
&gt; 
&gt; The most convincing thing you could do is stick with
&gt; it yourself a few weeks. In any case, she'll have to
&gt; feel like it's her own initiative. Best of luck to you
&gt; both.

&gt; &gt; I have
&gt; &gt; been pushing thru, not doing the mental reprimand I
&gt; &gt; was used to before and it is working. It's been a
&gt; &gt; while.. like 3 months maybe? I'm not really keeping
&gt; &gt; track. I've lost 12 lbs.
&gt; 
&gt; Congratulations! Not doing the mental reprimand may be
&gt; the single most important factor. Remember those
&gt; decadent, skinny French.

&gt; 
&gt; This is beautiful, Lee. Mind if I quote this on the
&gt; home page? It's a huge stumbling block for so many
&gt; people and I've never managed to put it this
&gt; succinctly.

HI Reinhard-Thanks for the great info. I did have a good weekend and 
chose my sweets well. As for my daughter,You are right she is always 
watching what I am doing as far as food, and she has lost some 
weight jusst cutting out the sugar drinks. She is a beautiful girl- 
her father is Norwegian and she got his genes,lucky girl. Thanks for 
your support. Julie
