&gt; HI Cranky Karen

Girl i am right there with you just ask Deb !Ive been bitchin all 
day,for many reasons. I think my sugar addiction will always be with 
me, its just getting control of myself to say no no you can wait til 
saturday or friday at midnight. Why is it we find it easy to tell 
our kids no but not ourselves.Must be a control issue. also karen 
take into consideration what time of the month it is for you. not 
good around here let me just say! some days are just easier than 
others.today i would have walked a mile for a choc. bar. instead i 
bitched LOLOL

Skinny people: everyone knows at least one who eats like your 
husband for me its my 18 year old daughter. really now... some 
people have all the fnn nerve dont they? when i was a nursery nurse 
eons ago, we always hated the moms who looked liked that hadnt even 
had a baby, chipper, hoppin around the room, running down the halls. 
for them we brought the babys out every 1 1/2 hours.. they had to 
pay somehow ! :)

Hey dont worry about exercise right now you've just started Nos. No 
ones watching to see if you are exercising or not except maybe the 
husband.:)my dh actually had the nerve to say if he could start the 
treadmill going for me, grrrrrr. not a smart comment to make after 
21 years.
That is so awesome 3 years not smoking ~!good for you~~!, this 
should be a cinch for you gf.

well must get dinner prepared oh yeah 

talk soon
Julie
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all! I can't tell you how much all of your stories and words 
have 
&gt; inspired me. Yet I feel so cranky. I hate thinking about food all 

&gt; day long. I hate that I can't control it. I feel like I have PMS. 

&gt; Sugar is worse than heroin. Vent Vent Vent.
&gt; My husband is a basketball coach and personal trainer. Needless to 

&gt; say, he is in great shape. Partly because of his job but mostly 
due 
&gt; to genetics. My son has definately inheriated his body type, They 

&gt; are both tall, slender and lean. Not to mention they can eat 
&gt; anything they want and not gain a pound. Then theres me. I look 
like 
&gt; the odd man out.
&gt; Yet I am more determined and optimistic than ever. I quit smoking 

3 
&gt; years ago. Hardest thing I have EVER done. Including labor. But I 

&gt; did it. I am addicted to sugar. I must also break this habbit. 
Today 
&gt; is a tad easier than yesterday. But not much.
&gt; Karen
&gt; P.S. not tackling the exercise yet. Afraid to know how out of 
shape 
&gt; I am.
