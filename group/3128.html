--- Penny Felton &lt;croc_hunter_penny@...&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; im just about to begin my long and wonderous journey
&gt; along the NoS 
&gt; path to eternal happy eating.
&gt; 
&gt; i don't think i'll have any problems with it but you
&gt; never know ;) 
&gt; one main problem i foresee is that in about 2 months
&gt; i'm flying to 
&gt; america for my 2nd year working at a summer camp.

Welcome to the group, Penny. And welcome in advance to
America for your summer trip. Some people find the
nosdiet easy and it clicks right away, others need to
get a few failed attempts under their belt. Either
way, it pays to get started.

&gt; i know we 
&gt; walk around all day, but i lack time for other
&gt; exercises, 

Don't underestimate walking! Especially if your camp
has hills. A little extra conscientiousness in this
regard could pay big dividends for minimal investment.

&gt; last year all
&gt; i did was a 
&gt; bunch of sit ups and pushups in the tent when i got
&gt; up/went to 
&gt; sleep. anyone have any other ideas of exercises i
&gt; could do at camp 
&gt; with minimal time to myself?

Don't underestimate pushups and situps either! I don't
like to do them, but not because they don't give you a
workout. I just find a sledgehammer more fun. If the
sledgehammer I prefer is inconvenient for you or
otherwise unappealing, you can still get a lot out of
the shovelglove principle of &quot;schedualistically
insignificant time,&quot; (intense, 14 minute weekdaily
workouts), using just the simple exercises you mention
(and maybe some squats and jumping jacks). If more fun
exercise opportunities (hiking, dancing, whatever)
present themselves on a given day, take those instead,
but keep something like this as a backup, a minimum
default. Just a suggestion. It's what I do when I
travel. I think you'll be amazed at how thoroughly you
can exhaust yourself, even without equipment, in a
mere 14 minutes.
