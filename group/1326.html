Hi Bonnie :)
Hmmm? Favorite song by the Dead? That's pretty hard for me to nail 
down, but recently I have been pretty into Friend of the Devil, the 
live version on the album &quot;Dead Set&quot; and that whole first live album 

which had Bertha and Mama Tried, Wharf Rat and Johnny B Goode...that 
one is a total classic.
But back to food and disfunctional dinnertimes :)
Ok...the Jewish/American families would say &quot;Eat or, ironically Es&quot;
the German/Yiddish word for &quot;to eat&quot; is, Essen,(so no essing is 

literally &quot;no eating&quot; ) and the Italian equivalent of the mantra was 

&quot;Mangia!&quot; Actually I think thats the country's national motto, 
lol!
Mmmmm, lasagna :)
Well we are learning something new and the responsibility is in our 
hands now.
I have found it very funny that two or three out of the people who 
have joined this group are from Canada (Rich L) and Tasmania (Jen)

I think that American culture has very little to offer these days in 
terms of healthy eating habits, only trendy commercialized products 
and false prophets. Because of the fact that NoS is so bluntly 
presented as a common sense, uncommercialized format, makes is appeal 
to a world audience, and &quot;subversives&quot;, as Jen put it. People who 

are more into PREVENTATIVE health, (wow what a concept!) not people 
who are just waiting till they have hypertension and blocked 
arteries, and then have to take lipitor, instead of just trying to 
control their destructive eating patterns. 
It is really surprising how many people subscribe to these ways of 
thinking. I am often in contact with people who don't even allow 
themselves to trust their feelings about their own bodies unless 
medical tests are there with outside empirical evidence to verify 
their concerns...Asking them &quot;how do you feel?&quot; is like asking what 

color the food is on the planet Zantron, a completely alien concept. 
They also would prefer to ignore their symptoms and wind up only 
paying attention by the time their problems are already a 
pathology...There is a painkiller for everything and an OTC cure for 
everything. Have you noticed how popular Pepcid and Prilosec are 
these days? Poor eating habits and stress? Lets just ignore it and 
take a pill instead.
The healthcare industry here is so pharmaceutically driven that, 
unless there is a pill involved, whats the use of even discussing it?
Eating healthy just doesn't benefit those pharmaceutical mega 
industries.

We give away all of our personal power and leave the responsibility 
for our health in other peoples hands. There is another way, and No 
S fits in with that self care, preventative model.
Once more, 
Three cheers for our little group of worldly, subversive, 
intellectual, and fabulous No Ssers! Hip-hippy hooray!
and of course our founding father,

Reinhard the Magnificent!
Master of Shovelglove!
Keeper of the Sledgehammer and 
protector of NoS'sers around the World!
Ruler of Sledglandia! (ha ha)

Hey what about those for a mug?
Love,
Debbie
