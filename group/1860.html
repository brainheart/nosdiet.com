&gt; Hi all
&gt; I'm starting this for the 1st time tomorrow but am still a little 

&gt; confused.
...That's ok Davina, I am confused 50% of my waking life...I will 
try to help answer your queries :) and good luck...

&gt; If we are supposed to eat each meal on one plate (btw what size 
&gt; plate do you use?) how is it possible to have apple desert, like 
on the post i read from yesterday? 
....Start out with normal to big plates if you think you will need 
to begin with good sized, but not gigantic meals...The thing about 
the &quot;one plate&quot; rule is that it deters one from going for 
seconds...and with most overeaters, without clear limits, this 
sometimes turns into thirds...So even if you eat a bit too much in 
the beginning or it seems loaded up and not diet-style, that's fine 
because you 1. don't want to feel as if you are dieting anyway 2. 
and,I should have maybe reversed the order of these goals in terms 
of priority, you are creating a solid habit of not going for 
seconds and eating a meal that is satisfying enough nutritionally, 
and otherwise, that you feel able to pass up unnecessary snacks 
which usually plague the average overeater, between meals....

&gt; also, is the only diet outline that main page of www.nosdiet.com 
or is there any other information i can read up on as to portion 
size and what to eat/not eat etc?
&gt; 
...Well actually, the main site has all the info you need to answer 
these ones, and I encourage you to look over it daily for all your 
NOS needs, and because it's so darn entertaining :)But if you want, 
here's the Debbie's Digest version...No foods are off limits except 
ones where the main source of calorie/nutritional content is 
sugar....The blatant &quot;bad&quot; sources of empty calories which one 

doesn't need to even think twice about...ie: soda, candy, cake, you 
get the idea... In the beginning first three weeks it's really not 
so much the portion you should concern yourself with it the habits 
of having regular meals...The number of meals is generally thought 
of as 3 but I believe it is ok to make it 4 smaller ones if this 
just doesn't conform to a life friendly plan for you...Build your 
regular eating at mealtime habit first and worry about portion way 
later on..This is because in time your stomach will really be more 
or an accurate gauge on how much will satisfy you, and by that time 
it will be sufficiently &quot;trained&quot; to not need as much. I started 

out eating really full plates, and visually this was great because 
it was nice to be thinking &quot;non-deprivation&quot; here... This plan is 

for life, and who would want to go around having to measure 
everything they eat all the time? That doesn't mean I am 
uninterested in calorie count and ingredient info in food 
(especially in processed food, and this is when you realize that 
there is alot of crappy stuff in most processed food) or don't care 
about making good choices, because I do...but keeping the rules 
simple and just using common sense (eg: don't choose to eat half a 
plate of deep fried pork rinds and the other half 15 mozzarella 
sticks! you get the idea... make some kind of choice that is vaguely 
healthy, in the traditional view of health). In regard to the 
applesauce or pureed fruit for dessert issue, I had a similar 
question a while back regarding soup. Obviously it's hard to eat 
soup on a plate : ) so with regard to portion, Reinhard mentioned 
the &quot;virtual fruit rule&quot; which is, either leave a space on your 

plate where the fruit or soup *would have been* so that you aren't 
eating too much, or just use a smaller plate for the rest of your 
meal, like a salad size one... I found that after the first 2 weeks 
or so, I was downsizing my portions naturally, because it took less 
to satisfy me.
Good luck :)
Debbie &quot;Old and Confused&quot; Feder
Peace
PS How is the Sceptered Isle :)
