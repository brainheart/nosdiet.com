HI All,okay i am missing my caramels today :) Deb, 3 inches, that is 
so inspiring !! I wore a shirt this weekend i couldnt get on over a 
week ago, much better now. I have approx.15-20 to lose. But i guess 
knowing i have control, am not on a crazy diet that i am going to 
quit in a month, i know i will make it thru and beyond. My husband 
is impressed by my resolve,my loss so far.Its not alot but every 
inch and every # counts.Someone was asking about lunch ideas on the 
road, did anyone have any suggestions?? Personally i do 
sandwiches,salads,soup if in the office.,fruit,leftovers from 
supper. Basically whatever i feel like having that day as long as 
its no s. Anyone else have any suggestions? I believe no matter 
where you live or dine, you can find something healthy to eat. 
Remember its not just quality but quantity of it that we eat. Last 
night we got take out from Chilis-burgers and fries. i ate 1/2 the 
burger and 1/2 the fries, and i was stuffed and satisfied.Most impt. 
i didnt over eat,no seconds and no sweets. I was reading someones 
post and it reminded me of all the bad press food has gotten when 
really we all just eat too much of it and dont exercise or work it 
off.So the person in the mirror is at fault, not Mcdonalds. No one 
to blame but myself for my jelly belly. No one forced the food down 
my throat. Its time to take responsibility for my actions. How many 
times have i warned my kids of the consequences of their actions and 
ignored it myself? hellooo :) have a good night everyone. Julie
