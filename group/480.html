How long does it take? That really depends on the person. Reinhard 
claims on the site that it takes about 3 weeks. For me, that was kinda 

true, but at the same time, I &quot;fell&quot; as you put it twice since those 

three weeks. The first time was a short period around Christmas...Then 

again when I got back to work (work at a high school) after the 
Christmas one I gained all my weight back, and started over...Got back 

to work, went for a week fine, then I started working so much that all I 

could do was snack. It's been about a month since I restarted again, 
and I still have a hard time passing up those candy bars that we sell at 

the basketball games, that I get for free. Yet, I force myself as much 

as possible, and if I slip...Well, I try to not slip again that day 
(though often if I do, the whole day seems to be craving sweets) but I 

weighed myself for the first time since I restarted this weekend, and 
I'm back down those 15...So, from here it's all progress, and I have no 

holidays that should mess me up. So basically, what I'm trying to say 
is, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and give it another go...and 
another, and another. If you need help, look to the group, they'll be 
happy to give you the support, I'll be happy to take anything you say 
and turn it into a long story about myself : ), if you need more 
physical help, tell someone to slap your hand every time you're caught 

with an S, or put money in a jar each time you fall as someone suggested 

a while back (I've toyed with that idea...I need all the money I make, 

would stop slips pretty quick).

&gt;someone pick me up ?? :-\
&gt; 
&gt;Honestly...I added another S...no eating after Supper...okay, it's just 
mine
&gt; but that's the ONLY thing I've kept so far this week. I wonder if 
all
&gt;this snacking and sweets is because of the other S word....Stress. 
My
&gt;brother is coming to stay with our family for undetermined amount of time. 

&gt; 
&gt;I knew I had fallen..and fallen hard when I ate...gulp....a peanut 
butter
&gt;and jelly sandwich **gasp** really....and now I'm sooooooooooooo hungry
&gt;for the munchies. My fruit supply is gone and I need to drink more water. 

&gt;I noticed when I started this change that when I ate good I felt REALLY 
good
&gt; And when you fall into temptation and eat that &quot;M&amp;M left on your 
computer
&gt;desk&quot; that it's really hard to say, &quot;hey it was only an M&amp;M, 
doesn't mean
&gt;you have to eat that bag of *insert favourite food here*. Which, well 
I'm
&gt;prone to do a lot more, here a nibble there a nibble so it doesn't 
&quot;Seem&quot; as
&gt;much, but in the end (like the one I'm sitting on) it all adds up. 
Right?
&gt; 
&gt;I always keep in the back of my mind, tomorrow is another day. ( so 
eat
&gt;more and start over then *jk*) But really, how long will this &quot;binge&quot; 
go
&gt;on? Is there any hope for us who lay by the roadside wading in our
&gt;chocolate syruped mudpuddles? 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I've babbled, I'll return you to your previous programming.
