well.
&gt; 
&gt;I agree. I've tried so many diet techniques, some of them quite 
similar to No-S, and this is the first time I've stuck with any of 
them longer than two weeks! Could it be possible that it was the 
mnemonic aspect that finally made the difference?! Maybe Dr. Phil's 
plan would have worked just as well, if only there'd been more 
alliteration in the (big fat) book. 

I also like being able to eat meals that others are eating -- no 
making one meal for the kids, one for my lo-carbing husband, and one 
more for me. And though they haven't all been delicious and/or 
healthy, they're sufficient. And if I didn't like the last one very 
much, there's another one in a few hours anyway. 

Also no abandoning the diet when I run out of some obscure but 
necessary item, like whole-wheat tortillas or Splenda. 

I love it! Still don't get why it's working when so many have failed 
for me; maybe I'm just plain ready now, and wasn't before this. I 
wonder how many diets Reinhard Engels tried before hitting on this. 
It's hard to tell by his narrative. Anyway, glad to see new posters; 
welcome all.
