My pleasure, as Shakespeare said
&quot;nothing is good or bad, only thinking makes it so&quot;
Congratulate yourself for every little choice which makes your life 
healthier : )

PS I had my first &quot;no soft drinks day&quot; today, and I feel totally 
motivated!
Yay no S!

&gt;What you said about setbacks was so helpful! What a new way to think
&gt;of them--very motivational. Thanks!

&gt; &gt; Yes Mike : )  I also love the feeling I have right now of being 
able
&gt; &gt; to make
&gt; &gt; good choices and eliminate that old eating on &quot;unconscious&quot;
&gt; &gt; autopilot.  I am
&gt; &gt; a massage therapist and the beauty of our bodies is that inherently
&gt; &gt; they do
&gt; &gt; want to be healthy and give us many signs that things could be out 
of
&gt; &gt; balance.  When we don't listen to our own signals, for example 
our
&gt; &gt; stomachs
&gt; &gt; being full or maybe being in pain, possibly due to dragging our
&gt; &gt; carcasses
&gt; &gt; around at a less than optimum weight, eventually we wind up hurting
&gt; &gt; ourselves, being depressed and just everything, well for a lack of 
a
&gt; &gt; better
&gt; &gt; word, sucking!
&gt; &gt; Reinhard gave us a reminder to really respect ourselves and take 
care
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; ourselves in a clear, empowering, simple and liberating way.
&gt; &gt; God gave us free will.  No government, dark force, secret agency, 
can
&gt; &gt; tell
&gt; &gt; us how to use it, especially in terms of our bodies.  We must 
be
&gt; &gt; respectful
&gt; &gt; and responsible for that ourselves.
&gt; &gt; When you really think about it, this is all about bringing
&gt; &gt; consciousness and
&gt; &gt; choice into our lives.
&gt; &gt; When we stuff ourselves (and believe me I have been &quot;putting it 
away&quot;
&gt; &gt; now
&gt; &gt; for a year and really wanted to end this &quot;shovelling&quot; and gorging 
but
&gt; &gt; couldn't face another &quot;diet&quot;, and ps now can you believe that 
even
&gt; &gt; Burger
&gt; &gt; King is spoofing that whole short fix diet industry in its
&gt; &gt; commercials, you
&gt; &gt; know &quot;Dr. Angus&quot;....It's really a joke)  we are totally not 
exhibiting
&gt; &gt; free
&gt; &gt; will or choices....It is pure autopilot and just plain old bad 
habit. 
&gt; &gt; When
&gt; &gt; we really go with the things our bodies need and truly make an 
effort
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; think before we &quot;stuff&quot; we are communicating with our inherent 
wisdom
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; that can never steer you in a wrong direction.  As a result we 
feel
&gt; &gt; more
&gt; &gt; alive and in tune with the flow of life, instead of that &quot;dead&quot;
&gt; &gt; feeling,
&gt; &gt; that depressed and totally apathetic feeling.
&gt; &gt; Nice to share feelings with you all and I welcome any inspirational
&gt; &gt; thoughts
&gt; &gt; or anecdotes you may have :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will leave you with one nice idea I utilized years ago when going 
it
&gt; &gt; alone
&gt; &gt; on diet #1.  It is fully compatible with &quot;No S&quot; lifestyle, and 
I
&gt; &gt; picked it
&gt; &gt; up from an audiotape by the then editor of Prevention Magazine, 
Mark
&gt; &gt; Brickman, I think....Here it is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When you have a &quot;setback&quot; don't let it bring you down, 
instead
&gt; &gt; embrace it, welcome it, be proud of it...
&gt; &gt; Only people going somewhere have setbacks,
&gt; &gt; Successful people have setbacks,
&gt; &gt; Setbacks are for people on their way to a better place.
&gt; &gt; You will keep moving forward if you think of them that way, so 
don't
&gt; &gt; guilt
&gt; &gt; yourself out if you have a setback along the way : )
&gt; &gt; Good luck to all and I am happy to be sharing this experience with 
you!

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hello Everyone,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;      Welcome all of you new comers. I am very proud to say that 
I
&gt; &gt; &gt;have been on Nos for almost a month now. I am really enjoying 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt;level of control that I have over what I chose to put in my body. 
I
&gt; &gt; &gt;truly believe in the lifestyle change.What I have really noticed 
is
&gt; &gt; &gt;that I use to eat so much to where the only time I thought I 
was
&gt; &gt; &gt;full was when I was completely stuffed. Now I only eat three meals 
a
&gt; &gt; &gt;day, one plate per meal and I am satisfied. I still cannot believe 
I
&gt; &gt; &gt;am doing this. The only other time in my life where I was able 
to
&gt; &gt; &gt;eat only three meals a day and no snacks was in military 
bootcamp,
&gt; &gt; &gt;which by the way was when I was in the best shape of my life.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Remember the system works only if you work it. I am really  happy 
I
&gt; &gt; &gt;found Nos!!!!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Good luck to all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;Mike
&gt; &gt; &gt;
