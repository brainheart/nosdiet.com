How about just having a proper meal, instead of snacking on high-energy rubbish? Just 
a thought.

Subject: [nosdiet] Musings of a Pre-dieter


Kudos to the developer of the NoSDiet plan and website--I was a 
little over halfway through reading all the information posted 
(rather entertainly presented, by the way) when I realized I had not 
encountered any glaring typos or grammar indescretions. Refreshing! 
[Thank you, dear librarian/unofficial-computer-programmer, for your 
commitment to the purity of the English language--a shining example 
that one can be both conversational AND grammatically conscious]

That said, the NoSDiet looks like something I maybe, possibly [yikes! 
I don't REALLY want to watch what I eat! Sometimes I'd rather eat 
terribly, live happily, and die young!], if I have some support, 
could do. I found this diet when it popped up after I google-searched 
for Dr. Gott's No Sugar, No Flour diet. I was searching for that diet 
for a number of reasons, and I think this diet will instead be 
better, so I'm glad you appeared and distracted me from my original 
search! 

Here's why I need a diet that virtually eliminates sugar: I'm 
addicted. I also have low blood sugar, so it's really not healthy for 
me to consume as much as I do. The biggest reason I'm searching for 
this diet, however, is because my best friend is wanting to lose 
weight. She says she'd like &quot;to exercise a little more and cut back 

on carbs.&quot; She wants me to help her. Hmph. We need a plan. I'm going 

to show the NoSDiet to her, and I think she'll be interested. It 
seems simple, straight-forward, and [I thought it would be fun to 
find another s-word to describe the diet, but it's just not going to 
work] fairly cheap.

I forsee a problem when I present this to her, though, so if you're 
still reading this :) and have a suggestion, I'd appreciate it: I 
think the no snacks thing will kill us. We're college students and 
will move back into the dorms in a month. I'm just not sure we can 
survive college life without snacking. All-nighters (which I LOATHE, 
but sometimes still pull to finish papers) require extra fuel--so, 
ugh! What to do?

I'll be eagerly awaiting any feedback and I'll let y'all know if she 
decides this is the diet for her. [Though I'm thinking--I may do it 
anyway...hmm. I'll think on it.]
