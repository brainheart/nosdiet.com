&gt; I feel awful, because not only did I have a snack, but one of them 

was a sweet. And I did it just because I was too lazy to explain my
current mindset and eating habits. How do you guys refuse things
offered to you in the course of a normal day?

...Michael :) Don't feel awful for such a tiny deviation, that 
isn't going to help...
I've been on NoS for months now and it's a day to day learning 
process... Start new right now :)
As for a polite way to handle the offer of &quot;snack&quot; food here's two 

options:
1. Wrap it up and take it home for part of your dinner, then you 
can enjoy it with no guilt attached...
2. Just say &quot;That looks delicious, but I am cutting out eating 
inbetween meals&quot; You don't have to get too indepth with lengthy 
explainations, and I feel anyone who has a brain in their head will 
respect you and won't get offended.

I actually brought in a couple of home made cookies last month to my 
chiropractor and partner Robert, but he just said &quot;No thanks&quot;... I 

know he has had weight problems too, so I just understood that he 
was trying to cut calories and just gave them to someone else.
Now, if you are trying to cut people off at the &quot;pass&quot; so as not to 

be tempted, it is perfectly okay to tell the people working with 
you &quot;I started a new plan and please don't bring any snacks my way 

since they are hard to resist and I want to lose some weight&quot;...
Out of sight out of mind...
Good luck :)
Deb
