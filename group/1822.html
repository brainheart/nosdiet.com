&gt; &gt; HI Deb, 
&gt; 
&gt; ....HI Jool! :)
&gt; 
&gt; how about limiting the # of houses you go to this year-
&gt; &gt; less homes less candy, or weeding out the ones that arent his 

&gt; &gt; absolute favorites. face it you always get ones that arent any 

&gt; good. 
&gt; 
&gt; ...Sounds like that Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin scenario
&gt; (&quot;What did you get?&quot;,,,&quot;I got a Rock&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck Julie
&gt; 
&gt; We discussed this last night...It was a scarier scene than 
Halloween!
&gt; I caved and decided to let him have around 40 mini candies, as the 

&gt; idea of 20 didn't really fare too well, LOL, to save and dole out 

&gt; over the next few months...I am really going to have to say some 
NOS 
&gt; mantras if that stuff is going to be around here...Maybe I'll bury 

&gt; it in the backyard and then we can dig it up every week like a 
&gt; treasure chest...*Then* we could make our *own* Diet of Worms! :)
&gt; When Richard asked me about &quot;What are we going to do if I want to 

go 
&gt; to more houses? This sucks!&quot; (or something to that effect)
&gt; I suggested that instead of asking for candy we would then tell 
&gt; the &quot;tricked and treater&quot; parents that since Mommy and me are 

doing 
&gt; NOS and limiting sugar, could they please donate a quarter, 
instead, 
&gt; to his savings account :)
&gt; I'm going to try and make him into a great Mummy, with bandages 
and 
&gt; black eyes, and focus on having a great time dressing up...
&gt; 
&gt; Hey Hana thanks for the good idea of walking to school...Being a 
&gt; very protective parent, and things aren't quite as 
blissfully &quot;safe&quot; 
&gt; as back when I was a kid and walked the 6 blocks to school (they 
&gt; probably weren't too safe then either, but it was a much more 
&gt; lenient time regarding kids safety) Richard takes the bus since 
he's 
&gt; just 8...He will probably walk once he's around 10 or 11? Also, 
the 
&gt; school doesn't allow candy or fruit rollups junk in their snacks 
or 
&gt; lunchboxes...A NOS school! Plus, back to the walking thing, 
Richard 
&gt; runs around like a wild monkey and has plenty of exercise, but no 

&gt; matter what, I really and truly want him to develop those good 
&gt; habits now...controlling snacks and sweets is a huge task for 
&gt; parents in this day and age, since we are just bombarded with 
crappy 
&gt; food choice alternatives on kids tv, etc... Once he hits 
adulthood, 
&gt; my job will just be to observe and support, but right now, I feel 

a 
&gt; duty to him *and* myself to be sincere and serious about curbing 
the 
&gt; junk food...2 days a week of that is plenty...
&gt; Have a great day, and say hi to the puppies :)
&gt; Love,
&gt; Debbie
&gt; PS I went to Kings Point Park yesterday and spent about 2 hours 
&gt; wandering around and taking photos...I really hope they come out 
&gt; well...If I can get them onto some CDRom maybe soon I can upload 
&gt; some new photos of both the famous woodland park *and* Richard 
&gt; as &quot;The Mummy&quot; :)

HI Deb, yeah i always was a charlie brown fan. LOL.That was the 
funnest part, was trading the ones you didnt like. I am sure you 
will do just fine. Do you remember getting caramel apples and 
popcorn balls at homes when you were a kid?? I do, then it all 
stopped when some kid got a razor blade in one. After that we just 
made them at home. Theres a half way healthy snack. News on my 13yo. 
as i mentioned before she has been trying to lose some weight and 
was all excited coming down stairs this am. MOM MOM i fit into the 
size 9 pants. you couldnt wipe the grin off her face. I am so happy 
for her. she is now in a smaller size than me at a 12.She has worked 
so hard and is seeing the fruit of her labors.she is going to keep 
going for a 7. which is a good size for her at 5'8&quot;. I am 5'6' and 

the least i have weighed as an adult was 115# (after the rice diet-
700cals a day)who wouldnt lose weight. pure torture i tell you. well 
gotta go meet a client. Later Jules
