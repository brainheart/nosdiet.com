&gt; Most of us have probably read the book, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Years ago a fellow dieter in my office burst out laughing while 
reading it, because the following passage reminded her so much of 
our faulty little cycle of thinking about eating. I've been meaning 
to find and share it for a long time, so here it is:
&gt; 
&gt; -------------
&gt; The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short 

visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;What are you doing there?&quot; he said to the tippler, whom he found 

settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and 
also a collection of full bottles. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I am drinking,&quot; replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air. 

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Why are you drinking?&quot; demanded the little prince. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;So that I may forget,&quot; replied the tippler. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Forget what?&quot; inquired the little prince, who already was sorry 

for him. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Forget that I am ashamed,&quot; the tippler confessed, hanging his 

head. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Ashamed of what?&quot; insisted the little prince, who wanted to help 

him. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Ashamed of drinking!&quot; The tippler brought his speech to an end, 

and shut himself up in an impregnable silence. 
&gt; 
&gt; And the little prince went away, puzzled. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,&quot; he said to himself, 

as he continued on his journey. 
&gt; -------------
&gt; 
&gt; I've been reminded of this many times and it has helped me see--
sometimes in time to avoid one--the ridiculous traps we (I) fall 
into. If you find no application, that's okay. If you do find one, 
I don't need to explain it to you!
