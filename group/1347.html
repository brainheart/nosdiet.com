Hi Cat

This is a hard one, especially if you have family and you keep 'bad' 
things in the house for them! You could try a couple of tactics: make 
sure that you eat well at your last meal of the day so that you can say 

to yourself that you don't need anything else and find yourself plenty 

of things to do that will keep your mind off food. If you're having 
problems with items such as sweets or snacks maybe you could keep them 

in something like a red tin or a cupboard that you have no other reason 

to visit. If I see food then I want to eat it so keeping it out of 
eyesight helps a lot. The red tin happened by accident but it's become 

a bit of a stop signal for me now - it gives me a chance to ask myself 

if I really want to eat what's in it before I've seen it.

hth

best wishes

Alison

PS Can I be cheeky and remind everyone about clipping previous messages 

when you reply to the list? We've had some pretty long posts lately!
