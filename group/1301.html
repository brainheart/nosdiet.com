Just had to comment about your comment below -- if you go on ANY diet and lose weight 
and then go off that diet and go back to what you were doing before (the same eating 
habits that caused you to gain in the first place) -- you WILL gain the weight back 
and probably more than you lost. Doesn't matter if it's low carb, low fat, low 
calorie or even NoS. Whatever you find that works for you to lose weight, you have to 
also figure out how to maintain that loss. I know for me -- I have lost weight many, 
many times. I go ON a diet, lose weight and the go OFF the diet. What happens when I 
go OFF the diet? I go back to eating the way I used to and gain it all back -- and 
very quickly, I might add. The beauty of NoS is that it is really teaching us how to 
maintain -- losing weight is really the wonderful side effect.

Mary
who after years of yo-yo dieting has embraced the concept of NoS but has still not 
been 100% successful putting it into practice -- I am doing NoS along with 
controlling carbs (which means no sugar or flour, even on S days) and trying to make 
NoS a permanent way of life.

seems some of those real
low carb diets are bad if you are not careful when you stop doing them, 
the
weight comes back.
