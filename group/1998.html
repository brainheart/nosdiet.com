From: &quot;Debbie Feder&quot; &lt;deborahfederlmt@...&gt;
&gt;...That is terrific news Diane! Super Sheats! Away! I bet you feel like a 

&gt;million bucks :)

Thanks, Deb! I've never been called Super Sheats before. =D You have a 

gift for nicknames--I'm sure you know that!

&gt;Try the measuring approach Diane...There is no room for guessing 
&gt;there...Your above statement is one of almost, disbelief (you know me and 

&gt;my over analyzing ways) &quot;apparent 2 lbs&quot; &quot;inclined to believe 
it&quot; With the 
&gt;scale it's more of a gamble whether or not you lost, it's water, it's a 

&gt;crappy scale etc....

Yup, I'm a skeptic. However, I've been in the Diet War so long that I 
don't think anything fazes me any more. I'm not doing No S to lose weight; 

I'm doing it to change my bad habits so that someday, eventually and slowly, 

I'll at least have a fair chance to lose weight--and then keep it off!

&gt;You can't argue with a tapemeasure...[snip]

Oh, yes I can! =) Take a closer look at my personality and you'll see. =P 

I find tape measures just as depressing as scales--perhaps more so. I'm a 

real mess. (Don't read anything into that because it's probably just a 

joke!) I am willing to get on the scale once a month but I can't be 
bothered to get out the tape measure. Do you know how many times I've taken 

my &quot;before measurements&quot; and how many times (zero) I've been able to take 

&quot;after measurements&quot;? It's like taking a &quot;before picture.&quot; I have 
too 
many, and I won't do that either. I'm not superstitious but it just feels 

like asking for trouble!!

After all that, I will say I'm willing to keep trying on clothes that were 

too small, until they fit. Not yet, though...maybe in two months. Thanks 

anyway for the ideas, because maybe they'll be perfect for someone else!

As long as we're on the subject of personality, you don't have to guess--you 

can read all about me at a cool handwriting analysis site I found. (Go to 

www.handwritingwizard.com if you want to take the test yourself.) If you're 

interested in me, go to <a href="http://www.handwritingwizard.com/login.phtml">http://www.handwritingwizard.com/login.phtml</a> 
and use 
my e-mail address and &quot;diane&quot; as the password (I don't consider this 

private!) and you'll see my analysis. Pretty accurate, too. I was 
interested to find out that I am an ambivert! This explains something I've 

been thinking about recently. I was wondering why I am able to adapt both 

to outgoing people and to introspective people. I seem to change my own 

personality to suit theirs, when I am with them. Well, here's what the 

analysis says: &quot;She has the unique ability to get along equally well with 

what psychology calls introverts and extroverts. This is because she is in 

between. Psychology calls Diane an ambivert. She understands the needs of 

both types.&quot; Hmm! Now we know.

I've always been interested in handwriting analysis and although this is 

simplistic, I was impressed. I think it's fun but also scientific.

Diane
