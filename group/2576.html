Hey, Deb -

I was with you all the way through on that one... =) (I guess my life has
slowed down a bit!) You are so funny, and I'm sure that verbalizing your
thoughts helps you reach better conclusions than if the thoughts just swirl
around in your head.

I just wanted to say that if someone gives in and has a snack, a pure
protein snack (or a piece of fried chicken, as you had) is not so terrible,
in my opinion. I've been more or less &quot;low carb&quot; for several 
years--not
always sticking to it, obviously--and I still believe it's the best option.
&quot;Low carb&quot; doesn't mean zero carbs per day. A low-carb lifestyle 
should
include a variety of proteins, good fats, generous quantities of vegetables,
and limited fruits and grains. Nothing wrong with that, right? It's right
in line with No S because overeating and sugar are always the common enemy.
Keeping carbs/sugar low moderates the appetite naturally.

Anyway, if I were truly hungry between a meal, or just &quot;thought&quot; I 
was
hungry and couldn't get past it (feeling shaky, perhaps), a piece of
chicken, cheese, lunchmeat, or a few nuts would be the answer. No guilt,
just count it as part of the next plateful. It's the cookies/chips/candy
bars/whatever between meals that start a bad cycle. And obviously one 
shouldn't bend the rules every day or even every week.

I was interested to learn on my low-carb Yahoo group that if one is actually 

experiencing low blood sugar--feeling faint or weak--a glass of juice is not 

really the quickest solution. I had always heard that something sugary was 

needed to immediately enter the bloodstream, but my expert friends (who do 

tons more research than I do!) tell me that protein is actually absorbed 

more quickly. It seems to work for me. I have very few of these episodes 

but it has happened.

Onward!
Diane

(as the creepo boyfriend was also a snob for
fresh mocha java and french roast, and he &quot;indoctrinated&quot; me 
too
LOL, seriously he did lot's of indoctrination back then, and I
rarely made any decisions for myself...sorry guys this is cheaper
than calling a shrink, okay back to sugar...)

**I thought this was hilarious! Yes, we're better than a &quot;shrink,&quot; for 

sure.**
