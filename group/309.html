Here's the offical subway page on jared:

<a href="http://www.subway.com/subwayroot/MenuNutrition/Jared/jaredStats.aspx">http://www.subway.com/subwayroot/MenuNutrition/Jared/jaredStats.aspx</a>

It looks like he ate just 2 meals a day, unless you
count coffee as a meal. Very impressive numbers, but
oh the monotony...

Thanks as usual, Dan, for fleshing out my hunches with
facts!

&gt; Nols,
&gt; 
&gt; Six meals a day *is* better than three. If you can
&gt; eat
&gt; small meals. But then you have to worry about
&gt; cooking
&gt; them, transporting them, etc. etc. In other words,
&gt; you
&gt; stay focused on food ALL the time. Much simpler to
&gt; eat
&gt; like a normal human being. That being said, if you
&gt; like dieting as a hobby or as a way of life (for
&gt; self-discipline purposes or whatever) help yourself.
&gt; Make sure to count calories, because those six meals
&gt; are going to be really small. As you can see,
&gt; counting
&gt; calories completely defeats the point of NOS. 
&gt; 
&gt; On Shovelglove: having visible abs comes down to two
&gt; things: 1) having a low enough bodyfat percentage,
&gt; and
&gt; 2) having built-up the abs through work. The
&gt; abdominals do have a flexion function (i.e. the one
&gt; that is used in crunching) but further, they have a
&gt; stabilization function. Stabilization is the main
&gt; function of the abdominals, and if you swing around
&gt; a
&gt; heavy sledgehammer for 14 minutes a day, you will
&gt; develop this function (i.e. objective #2). In
&gt; addition, you'll burn some extra calories that will
&gt; help you achieve objective #1. If you're serious
&gt; about building up your abs, you shouldn't be doing
&gt; crunches, anyway... they're useless. 
&gt; 
&gt; On Jared from Subway:
&gt; 
&gt; NOS succeeds where Jared's plan is weak: that is, it
&gt; allows for variation in the diet. I originally read
&gt; about Jared's plan a few years ago in Men's Health,
&gt; and they said it was critically low in several
&gt; nutrients. The reason for this is that he had the
&gt; same
&gt; stuff for lunch and dinner, every day! Now, he
&gt; mastered portion control, but at the cost of
&gt; nutrition. The funny thing is, too, if you look at
&gt; the
&gt; guy, he's still kinda rotund. (Skinny fat). He was
&gt; getting somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 g of
&gt; protein a day... which isn't terribly good for
&gt; anyone.
&gt; The point is, a varied diet is rule #1 for any good
&gt; eating plan, and NOS succeeds (at least, insofar as
&gt; your natural eating is varied).
