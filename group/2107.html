&gt; Dear Deb,
&gt; Seems to me that exercise builds more muscle that probably weighs 

more than fat...but sure look better than fat. Two people can be the 
same height and height, but the one who exercises will look better 
in their clothes....
....Yes, and they will certainly *feel* better too...if there was 
some way we could all take that great feeling and crystallize it 
into something more permanent, it would be a wonderful motivator for 
healthy eating choices and maintaining exercise...I don't know about 
you, but as soon as my blood gets pumping, it's an instant mood 
changer and I feel inspired to do and treat myself the best that I 
can, in all aspects of my life, not just eating. You know what they 
say, respect and treat your body like the temple that it is...

&gt; that is what it appears when I look at those &quot;I lost 100 
pounds .....look at me now&quot; in the magazines, some ladies still look 

pudgy and others...maybe even weighing more than even me -a size or 
two smaller!
....Bonnie, I really have a firm belief that:
1. Those pictures are all doctored up and a false representation 
meant to sell something. Truth isn't in advertising.
but I know what you are saying and getting at, and I just don't 
think that the body will look and function at it's best if you don't 
keep challenging it, and do *some* moderate exercise...You don't use 
it, you lose it, is a saying I like.
but,
2. I don't believe in looking at others on the outside, to compare 
myself in how I look and feel. At least not anymore. I used to do 
that but it is very counterproductive, and even damaging, to my 
soul. That's not to say that occasionally I will come across 
someone who somehow inspires me, with the way that they take care of 
themselves, but the looks part of that is almost secondary to the 
fact that they seem to eminate &quot;self love&quot; and *that* is the part I 

am inspired by...Not just an abstract concept like &quot;they are a size 

8&quot; It's a very hard thing to resist, not looking externally, and 
comparing...That is what most of us are taught and conditioned to do 
in this society, and it takes a herculean effort, to not base your 
idea of personal beauty, on how others look..We must cultivate this 
love through our own efforts, and through methods which nurture us 
in body, mind and soul.
Did anyone listen to the NPR link Diane posted? It was a monologue 
from the writer of the Vagina Monologues, but it's a new piece 
called &quot;Good Body&quot;
Interestingly enough, there is a line in the script, spoken by a 
Masai Tribal Woman who likened a womans body shape to a tree, and 
and asked whether you would think that one tree is more beautiful 
than another just because their shapes were different? I say 
interestingly enough, because when I walked through the woods (and 
guys please check out my photo page on Urban Ranger if you have a 
moment) I was thinking a similar thought then...I thought, as the 
leaves were falling so gracefully from the boughs, &quot;trees don't 
resist change like us...They let go of their leaves without a 
struggle, and let nature run its course. If we could all shed 
our &quot;leaves&quot; (ie: past negative body or emotional baggage) we all 

could move on and be transformed, without a struggle, without 
judgement...Does a tree think about whether others approve of it? 
We could all learn a lesson from the trees&quot; (hey this reminds me of 

the Lorax!)
Well it's my feeling and I hope you get my meaning :)

&gt;I have not lost any thing so far this week, but had bought a pair 
of a size smaller pajamas, and my DH said those are cut nice and 
look nice on you....
....Kudos to Walt for saying a nice and supportive comment. I bet 
you felt fantastic!

I know it is not cause they just fit, but because I lost a lot of 
Marshmellow fluff in the middle
....No more Stay Puff Marshmallow Lady for Bonnie :)!
That is a great feeling, so put it in your storage warehouse of good 
feelings and take it out whenever needed!
Congratulations Bonnie :)
Love,
Debbie
