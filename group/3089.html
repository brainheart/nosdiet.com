Hey Nossers... Any of you like Monty Python? LOL...
Anyway, please forgive me Reinhard and group but I wanted to reach a 
large audience on this... I will not peddle any penis enhancing 
products or the like in future... So here's a mini &quot;Spam&quot; for a good 

cause... Me! LOL....

I am very big believer in the power of prayer...
Many of you folks, I consider dear friends and, pretty much my &quot;NoS 

Family&quot;... 
I just came home from an interview for a job that would be very 
helpful to me in my life right now... It's as a part time secretary 
at a Holistic Podiatry office very nearby where I live... The hours 
are great, the pay is great... I would be very appreciative if those 
of you who are inclined to, would please send out a good prayer for 
me that I land the job... There's actually evidence for the power of 
prayer in scenarios where anonymous people were asked to pray for 
the health of an ailing person in a remote hospital...they compared 
the progress of one group of sick people to the group that received 
these &quot;anonymous&quot; prayers from afar.. Well the group which received 

prayers got considerably better... Sorry guys but no footnote on 
that.. Just take it as anecdotal for now... So I'm just hoping to 
turn up the volume so that the Universe will hear me better :) 
There's power in numbers... Ask St. Patrick if necessary, this week, 
or perhaps the patron saint of Feet...Whovever that is..
I think that may be &quot;Santa Odiferous&quot; LOL...
If I get this position, I believe it will be a great blessing and 
will help take a huge burden of worries off my mind...
The doctor said he is going to interview others until probably next 
week around this time...
Please cross your collective fingers for me guys!
Peace and Love,
Deb
PS... I thought what you wrote to Mayo was really fab Reinhard!
Enjoy the day!
