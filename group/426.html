Thanks Reinhard, 

96 pounds is alot of weight......and if I lose it all I will be the same weight I was 
when I was a Junior in High School.....over 10 years ago. My husband says that I only 
need to lose about 70 pounds because I'll never be the same size I was in HS 
again.....lol. The way I look at it is, if I lose 70 I may as well go for the gold ya 
know what I mean. I just had a baby in August and I still have 11 pounds on me from 
that pregnancy, but it is coming off. I really can identify with your diet. I have 
lost weight before, and gained it back because I stopped doing my own version of the 
no-s diet. After my 2nd child I lost all but those last 26 pounds that I referred to 
previously. I did that by limiting my sweets, no snacks, and having balanced meals. 
Also, absolutely no soda. Not even a diet one. Those things give me migraines 
anyways. Unfortunately, I went through a divorce, moved halfway across the country 
and basically started a new life. When that happened I fell back into
my same old bad eating habits and gained just about all of that weight back.(Doesn't 
it stink that the weight comes on so much easier than it goes off?) Then, after 
remarrying, I found out that I was expecting baby #3 and (even though pregnancy is no 
excuse) gained the rest of it back. So here I am now, back where I started. I tried 
the Atkins diet for ONE day and failed at it miserably. I am a vegetarian, and don't 
know why I tried it in the first place. I love vegetables and pasta and can not eat 
meat or eggs. I decided that I could not live on cheese and mayonnaise. That's when I 
found your website and it just hit me like a sledgehammer....( :) ) DUH, that's what 
I needed to do.....not eat different foods persay, but eat less and better food. It's 
really just common sense and what nutritionists and doctors have recommended for 
ages. Congratulations to those of you who have made it thus far in my post! I'll stop 
telling my life story now and go drink a big ole glass
of water! :)

Welcome, Jenifer. 96 pounds is like running a marathon
(or 2). My biggest piece of advice to you is don't
sprint. Patient discipline over time = enormous,
permanent results, and a much happier life doing it.
