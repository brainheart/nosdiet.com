 If it's a more retrained soup, then use the &quot;virtual fruit&quot;
&gt; rule: eat the soup in a separate bowl but just make
&gt; sure to adjust your subsequent portions accordingly,
&gt; either use a smaller plate or leave a patch of plate
&gt; clear. 

Thanks Reinhard, That seems like a functional plan, and now my guilt 
of eating soup is a thing of the past :) Don't worry I am sure 
Campbells isn't checking out No S and you are out of copyrighting 
danger, but I guess it might be conceivable.
I will probably opt for the smaller sized plates, because there is 
something satisfying about a full plate, even if it is a small one. 
Looking at an empty space, I know, won't work for me...And it 
probably will get filled in, somehow, later on in the day. When I 
know I ate a full portion, I can't say later &quot;Hmmm, that really was 

a less than adequate meal, now I guess I can eat a huge portion to 
make up for before&quot;.
I am really going to try to be very very very strict, because, I am 
so completely sure that once my good habits take the place of bad, I 
will see some nice changes :)


&gt; Have trouble imagining how much space a &quot;virtual soup&quot;
&gt; should take up? 

Virtual Soup! LOL I love it. This reminds me of an episode of 
Spongebob Squarepants where Plankton is eating dinner with 
his &quot;Computer Wife (complete with naggy computer wife voice) and 
sits down to a family dinner of 
&quot;Holographic Meatloaf&quot; :)

Mm, mm, good to you :)
Debbie
