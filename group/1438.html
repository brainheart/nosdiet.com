Why do we as a culture believe in the need to feed our children junk 
food? How many of us would have issues with food if our parents had 
fed us salads and lean meats all our lives, rather than cookies, 
cakes, and fried fish sticks? And why do public schools of all 
places also serve this stuff?

staff,
&gt; teachers and non-teaching, eat salads. Male staff eat old fashioned 

meat and
&gt; 2 vegetables cooked dinners and Kids eat hot-dogs, hamburgers and 

chips
&gt; (fries to our American cousins) There's been a lot of public 
discussion
&gt; about healthy eating for kids in Britain. I could have told the 
authorities
&gt; that even if it's on offer the kids won't eat it.We have a kid with
&gt; Prader-Willi syndrome, which means she has no sense of having eaten 

enough.
&gt; this child is hugely fat and waddles rather than walks. She has a 

carer who
&gt; chooses a salad lunch for her. I've seen her idea of salad. She 
gets a bowl
&gt; of pasta salad , potato salad and coleslaw, all with mayonnaise 
dressings.

&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've fallen off the wagon since my first post, jumped back on for 

a
&gt; &gt; week, and am now in my first official NoS weekend. I'll admit 
I
&gt; &gt; haven't resrained too much. Now I'm looking forward to the next 

five
&gt; &gt; days of NoS and I'm wondering if you all could post some favorite
&gt; &gt; meals. Not the recipes, necessarily, just thought we could share
&gt; &gt; what we eat during the NoS week.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -Amanda :)
