Hang in there, Maxine. I didn't weigh myself at all
for the first couple of months. It's slow, but if you
eat less (and it should be very obvious whether you're
eating less on this system because your windows of
opportunity are few and easy to monitor) you will lose
weight. If you've been strict, I'm confident results
will come. If you've had lapses but basically stuck to
your guns, you should be in a better position this
week, willpower and habit wise, to reduce such lapses.

&gt; Hi
&gt; I started last week on the s diet. I weighed in
&gt; tonight. I didnt loose but I didnt gain either. I
&gt; stayed the same. So Im going to keep going. And
&gt; see what happens next week. 
&gt; Maxine 
&gt; P.S, I drank hot chocolate today with my lunch. Do
&gt; you think that is a sweet? If it is I will save it
&gt; for my s days

&gt; Greetings from a new member who has been secretly
&gt; reading all your 
&gt; emails. (Were your fingers tingling?) What fun! I
&gt; started no-s 
&gt; February 21, yes, I know that was a &quot;S&quot;aturday, but
&gt; I figured I 
&gt; might as well start the diet on one of its less
&gt; stringent days. I 
&gt; must say that the reason I chose no-s was that I
&gt; know I'm not going 
&gt; to carry a calculator/measuring cups/&quot;approved&quot; food
&gt; lists with me 
&gt; to dinner. I was becoming so obsessed with which
&gt; foods were ok that 
&gt; I was hungry all of the time. (your body reflects
&gt; what your mind 
&gt; dwells on...) I also realized that the foods I
&gt; gravitate toward for 
&gt; snacks are anything but carrots, celery sticks,
&gt; blablabla. They (my 
&gt; snack foods and the sweets) are exactly the foods
&gt; that made me what 
&gt; I am today. So if I do nothing but eliminate snacks
&gt; and sweets 
&gt; (seconds are not much of an issue), and keep up my
&gt; mild exercises, I 
&gt; can't help but lose. Just as I looked in the mirror
&gt; one day and 
&gt; screamed &quot;EEK,&quot; I know one day I'll look in the
&gt; mirror and 
&gt; scream &quot;YAHOO.&quot; The best to everyone...
