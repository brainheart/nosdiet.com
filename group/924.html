&gt; D's posting with this subject line had little to do with religion. 

&gt; this one does. if you are thoroughly convinced of the lack of a 
god 
&gt; or the inefficacy of prayer, then you can blissfully ignore the 
rest 
&gt; of this post. i think the majority of you may benefit from it. 
&gt; some people can drop a few pounds successfully by &quot;putting their 

&gt; mind to it.&quot; i have relatively few pounds to lose, but my weight 

is 
&gt; an issue that has plagued me for years. i've also got youth on my 

&gt; side. i came to the conclusion awhile back that i am incapable of 

&gt; losing this weight by my own strength. for those with a lot more 
&gt; weight to lose and who have ingrained bad habits a lot longer than 

i 
&gt; have, i can imagine that you would find it even more difficult. if 

&gt; you look at any 12 step program- AA, overeaters anonymous, etc., 
the 
&gt; first step, i think, is to acknowledge your dependence on a higher 

&gt; power. i expect that even with complete faith and openness to God, 

&gt; the process will still be trying and long. although i am not 
&gt; yet a weight-loss &quot;success story,&quot; i have seen prayer work in 

&gt; amazing ways in other parts of my life. i am actually greatful for 

&gt; this particular struggle, because it forced me to turn to God and i 

&gt; am more committed to my faith. maybe it was part of His plan. 
&gt; maybe not. give prayer a try. i don't think Zeus will strike you 
&gt; down with a thunderbolt for asking.




In my reply I was trying to find something I could compare the need 
for flexibility to and was expressing why and how i had to flex my S 
days.
If I really wanted to be preached at about prayer and my weight at 
the same time I would have called my mother thank you very much.. I 
am sure YOUR beliefs are fine for YOU but I do not come to this group 
for prayer advice. I came here to lose weight which I am doing since 
I stick to the basics and do not try to complicate myself in calorie 
counts and fat grams and what is a healthy snack. I eat my three 
squares a day and none of them involve &quot; grace before meals&quot;.
This does not make me an ungrateful person; just my beliefs and 
theories on the world do not mesh with yours and I will thank you 
very much to not preach at me anymore
