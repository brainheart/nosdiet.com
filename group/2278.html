--- Hi Deb&amp; All:the crisp sounds yummy, def. an S with the sugar, 
you could try splenda to sweeten, just wouldnt be the same color as 
brown sugar maket it. or just wait til an S day. Thank you for your 
great assistance with the pomegranate peeling incident.:)
Next to discuss:Moms
Moms are so funny, My sister and I have been talking about when our 
mom passes away what we will do with all of her junk she has in her 
2 rooms at my sisters home(she has lived with them for 21 years)_She 
saves every bit of paper,mail,souvenirs etc.. every drawer and every 
closet is stuffed.When they were moving back in there home afetr 
Hurricane Charley we went thru a couple of her drawers and threw 
away a few things.I dont think she ever noticed except that her 
drawers were straightened out :) I personally love throwing things 
out,or giving them away. I would make a great hostess for the show&quot; 

Clean Sweep &quot;. We have a rule that near holidays or birthdays we 
take things we no longer wear or use to Goodwill or Salvation Army. 
It feels good to rid ourselves of the old before getting the new. My 
husband on the other hand, dear as he may be grrrr, gets rid of very 
little and then when he goes to find that screw he saved he cant 
find it so goes and buys some more. You would think he could figure 
it out that its not worth storing. We have a 2 story garage that 
will hold 6 cars and it is a mess. I have been thinking about 
calling Clean Sweep to see if they do garages.:) well i guess i am 
done rambling,oh by the way I love to eat :)especially today,rainy 
outside, i want come cookies and hot tea and a good book,a comfy 
couch,and in that order. Is that too much to ask for this 2nd day of 
December? I think not. :) Looking for cookies !!! Jools
