I've found that social eating, the bane of most other
diets, is the best way of ensuring portion control on
this one. You only get one plate, so to pack it away,
that plate has to be pretty big. The funny looks and
comments you'll get if you pile it high are more
effective than any special plate. 

I don't mean to knock the advice Hana gives (which is
very sensible), just to point out another,
complementary way of approaching the problem.

&gt; pattern with food, but
&gt; not the rim.&quot; I personally have plain white plates,
&gt; but keep my portions of
&gt; everything except steamed veggies to the centre of
&gt; the plate and it's
&gt; working for me.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for all the responses guys! True,
&gt; sometimes I tend to
&gt; &gt; get a bit impatient (hehe). Anyway, as for the
&gt; warrior diet question
&gt; &gt; and why I like the philosophy:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Basically, a few reasons
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. The ultimate aim is to limit total daily
&gt; caloric intake to 1
&gt; &gt; sitting. And for someone like me, who can be
&gt; &quot;good&quot; all day if he
&gt; &gt; knows a good dinner is on the way, that is a
&gt; godsend.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. I live at home with my family, and coming home,
&gt; a good Indian
&gt; &gt; dinner is always ready (and is pretty nutritious)
&gt; so I don't have to
&gt; &gt; worry bout constantly eating the wrong kind of
&gt; food on this diet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. I enjoyed feeling light on my feet and not
&gt; having an excuse to be
&gt; &gt; lazy (the approach of mealtime sometimes tends to
&gt; do that to me)
&gt; &gt; throughout the day since I work at an Investment
&gt; Bank.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; HOWEVER, there are a few reasons why I chose the
&gt; NoSdiet instead:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. I am not what you call a consistent person in
&gt; much of anything. I
&gt; &gt; have the all or nothing mentality. Thankfully, up
&gt; until now,
&gt; &gt; the &quot;all&quot; phases in my life have balanced the
&gt; &quot;nothing&quot; phases in my
&gt; &gt; life in terms of fitness and gotten me to 170 lbs.
&gt; But I know I could
&gt; &gt; have already reached my goals if I had not been so
&gt; extreme. The
&gt; &gt; warrior diet, I fear, might just enhance my
&gt; extreme nature towards
&gt; &gt; diet and I don't want that. I want to be able to
&gt; adhere to a plan
&gt; &gt; centered on moderation with some rules, like the
&gt; NoSdiet. Then, when
&gt; &gt; I am ready, mebbe I can switch to the Warrior
&gt; diet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. I fear the physiological effects of the WD. I
&gt; think that people
&gt; &gt; who are overweight are more sensitive to storing
&gt; extra calories
&gt; &gt; ingested in one meal as fat then slim people. To
&gt; that end, I think
&gt; &gt; the WD would be better as a maintenance type of
&gt; diet once you reach
&gt; &gt; the weight you want.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Reinhard,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The main problem I have with &quot;maybe&quot; overeating is
&gt; that in my case,
&gt; &gt; it's not so obvious. The problem is mostly
&gt; centered around dinner.
&gt; &gt; That is where the &quot;no seconds&quot; part is harder for
&gt; me. The type of
&gt; &gt; food I eat is vegetarian and not too fatty, so the
&gt; calories are less.
&gt; &gt; The problem is that I can't not have seconds
&gt; unless I absolutely cram
&gt; &gt; my plate with food the first time! However, it's
&gt; slowly getting
&gt; &gt; easier to guage how much I need so that the next
&gt; day, I am not
&gt; &gt; starving but not stuffed either. I am also working
&gt; out daily so that
&gt; &gt; tempers this problem a bit until I get a handle on
&gt; it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
