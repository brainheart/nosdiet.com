Hi Michael,

&gt; Anyway, I'm doing fine with the program, but trying
&gt; to not get
&gt; discouraged as I don't feel that I'm losing any
&gt; inches or weight.
&gt; Apparently, I'm just eating more at meals which
&gt; cancels out the sweets
&gt; and junk I'm not eating through the week.

Even if all you are doing is reallocating your
calories to single plate meals instead of spreading
them out all over the place, it's a great thing (and I
do think it's likely something's getting lost in the
reallocation, even if it's not very noticeable yet).
The windows of opportunity have been narrowed. You
have an immediate, obvious sense of how much you're
eating. It's very clear whether that mountain of food
on your plate is way too much, and what you should do
about it. You're in a much better position to make
changes. Don't go too fast. Keeping to the literal
rules, as you have been, is the foundation, you don't
want to jeopardize it by overreaching. What's my
advice? Next meal, knock one little pebble off that
mountainous plate. Can you make it to the next meal
without too much pain and suffering? Great. Knock off
another pebble. Too close for comfort? Put the pebble
back, stick with the status quo a bit, then try again.
Relax. Go slow. Prioritize maintaining what you've
already achieved. You have a foundation. You have
time.

&gt; 
&gt; And I've not had any time for exercise this week,
&gt; either.

It'll be February Tuesday. Make a monthly resolution
to do your exercise (shovelglove, right?) every N day
for a month, no exceptions (Feb is the ideal month for
this, just 28 days!). Only by making it non-negotiable
are you going to get it done enough consecutive days
to build a habit. By keeping the day of reckoning
near, just a month away rather than a year, you keep
the necessary pressure on, and yet you are less likely
to despair of achieving a very distant goal. What
happens at the end of the month? If you've succeeded,
you've got a habit. Continuing then is relatively
easy, and you can free up your resolve for something
else.
