you do have a point.. in the usa illness is profitable i know many
treatments around the world are not approved here as they are &quot;experimental&quot;
well when theres nothing more to do ..why not try anything and everything.
in the usa they get downright hostile when you talk about alternate health
treatment and nutrition look at the bashing dr atkins took for years my
mother being an RN has been interested in health and nutrition and i
remember years ago as a child my mother listening to nutrition shows that
were very radical 
but yes you have a point we are not the world and much research goes on 
all
around us

Here in Britain health care is nationalised and we all pay our insurance 
for
care that is free at the point of use, with a few exceptions, Dentistry 
and
eye care are only free for children and retired seniors. I am diabetic 
and
get all my medication free too. The cancer specialists here and the cancer
charities are searching for cures for the several different types of
cancers. They have nothing to gain by failing to find them. Similar systems
operate in most of Europe. the USA IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE
MEDICAL RESEARCH GOES ON. Insulin was discovered in Canada,(Banting and
Best) bacteria as the cause of infection was found in France and Germany
(Pasteur and Koch) Antiseptics and antibiotics in Britain(Lister and
Fleming)Waterborne disease England (Snow) and transplant surgery in South
Africa (Barnaard). There's a big chunk of the world outside the USA which 
is
educated and motivated. the use of the internet is shrinking the world.
Sorry if I've sounded off, but I do sometimes find American attitudes too
insular.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Deb, in case I forget to tell you again, I think your writing style 
is
very
&gt; creative and entertaining! I don't often hear people say &quot;honkin&quot; and 
it
is
&gt; such a satisfying word. I also liked: &quot;So go to your dairy department
when
&gt; you are sad that you only lost 2 or 3 pounds and hold a huge chunk 
of
&gt; cheese. Then you may find yourself saying &quot;cheese&quot; and smiling 
:)&quot; I bet
&gt; you smiled when you thought of saying that.
&gt;
&gt; I guess that the reason I hesitated to bring up a nutrition topic 
the
other
&gt; day is that I have learned there are so many widely varying views on 
all
&gt; subjects, and it gets wearisome covering the same ground. But I, too,
don't
&gt; believe that cancer comes zooming out of nowhere for reasons too
mysterious
&gt; to understand, and that we need to expend all kinds of effort and money 
to
&gt; point fingers at THIS--no THAT--and don't eat THIS--and REALLY watch 
out
for
&gt; THAT!! No wonder people eventually just tune it all out (by the time 
they
&gt; reach 80, anyway). I don't believe anyone will ever find a cure for
cancer
&gt; because &quot;treating&quot; cancer is too profitable. And I don't think 
the
American
&gt; Cancer Association really wants to close down.
&gt;
&gt; With all of that said, one statement I heard lately has stuck in my 
head:
&gt; &quot;Cancer feeds exclusively on sugar.&quot; I have also heard that cancer 
cells
&gt; form in all our bodies every day, but a healthy immune system takes 
care
of
&gt; them. I also know (by experience and by reading) that sugar suppresses
the
&gt; immune system. So whenever I feel a bit rebellious about giving up
sweets,
&gt; I remind myself of these facts and it puts a bit of healthy fear into 
me.
&gt;
&gt; I have had a pretty good week so far and I feel I have made the proper
&gt; commitment to No S this time. I have sometimes been really hungry 
between
&gt; meals but I have been able to wait. I was thinking, maybe another
advantage
&gt; to this system is that it's not really &quot;NO&quot; but more like 
&quot;WAIT.&quot;
Whatever
&gt; you really want, if you just wait a bit longer, you can have it. I 
am
&gt; experiencing some of that feeling of control that I tasted the first 
time,
&gt; and I think it's quite a gift. Nobody will stay in prison 24 hours a 
day
if
&gt; you give them the key to the lock. But if there were a distinct advantage
&gt; to staying in prison part-time, a person might have the self-discipline 
to
&gt; let himself in and out at proper intervals. In my past, going on a 
diet
&gt; always felt like throwing myself in prison and throwing away the key. 
Who
&gt; could handle that? That's why I've refused to &quot;go on a diet&quot; for 
many
years
&gt; now--it ends up being counter-productive because when you break out 
of
&gt; prison you always go wild.
&gt;
&gt; Not that it hasn't all been said before! =)
&gt;
&gt; Diane
