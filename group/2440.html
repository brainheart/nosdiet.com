&gt; Congratulations, Deb.
&gt; 1) It's a tough time of year. Stasis is progress.
&gt; Progress is that much more praiseworthy.
....Thanks pal! Yes when I think of how much backsliding I did in 
one stressful Winter/(continues indefinitely till I found this 
group) and how much weight I put on from eating with 100% bad habits 
100% all the time, by now I could very easily been up an additional 
30-40 lbs... Thank God I nipped 75% of that behaviour... I eat 
plenty now, but I think it's because, again, its Winter/hibernation 
time for me...At least I have my Shovelglove and this great group... 
It is unbelievably useful and helpful to know that I'm part of a NoS 
team around the world...It never hurts to have friends and support, 
so thank you again.

&gt; 2) As you've shown, most of our habits are so lousy
&gt; that even small, imperfect adjustments can have an
&gt; impact. Those of you who are sitting on the sidelines,
&gt; put your perfectionism aside and jump in.
....Great point, and yes, when you can get even 50% of those crappy 
habits changed, without much pain at all, it gives you a feeling of 
empowerment, and self esteem, and then *that* just encourages you to 
maintain those changes and hopefully continue to improve 
progressively... It is no small feat to attempt to change lifelong 
habits, they are toughies... 

&gt; 3) Think what being &quot;literally&quot; strict will bring you.
&gt; It's not that much harder (I'd argue that it's even
&gt; easier). You're almost there.
... I'm glad you feel this way. I do too :)

&gt; Sorry for the bullet points. Too much powerpoint this
&gt; morning..Reinhard
....Hey we can't all express ourselves in very lengthy rants, like 
me. Someone has to be concise... I appreciate your personal 
involvement, and I'm sure that I can speak for others in expressing 
a hope that you continue &quot;shooting&quot; those helpful bullets... You 

have your eyes on the target, and it always is nice to hear your 
encouraging words and advice &quot;Regin&quot;hard :)
Have a groovy day! See you latah.
Love,
Deb
