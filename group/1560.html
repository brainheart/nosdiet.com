&gt; I don't know if many people are successfully harassed

&gt; aware of no-s.

I second that Cyber Sister!
Nagging is the #1 demotivator guaranteed to annoy him into not being 
interested.
Maybe he would consider just changing his sugary sodas for flavored 
seltzer water and just try it as an experiment for a week?
Was he even remotely curious?
I used to be friends with a surgeon who ate a lot of sweets. He 
also, fortunately for himself, jogged an average of 15 miles a day, 
so he seemed to be able to afford the extra calories, and was never 
fat. But I distinctly remember him saying that the one thing he 
would never do was to drink soda. In this medical professionals own 
words he would &quot;rather have his daily calories from food, not 
liquids&quot;....Liquid calories are a killer...They are gone in a few 

seconds, you don't really get full from them, and they just go 
straight to your ass, or whatever your trouble zone happens to be...
TV and eating, it seems, are inextricably linked...You are up 
against a challenging adversary.
Refer your husband to this post and that way, I will be the nag, not 
you :) LOL Hope he tries it, but don't make that *your* crusade.

Good luck! You will love this plan! I have lost 6 lbs in 4 weeks!
Peace
Debbie
