Hey all, I actually had a little flurry of work today, so I haven't 
already posted 15 posts :) LOL!
Mom went to visit the Grandparents in sunny Florida this afternoon.
I came home and she had left my little Richie a delicious dessert 
from a very good local bakery called Bruces... It was so cute! A 
chocolate &quot;Mouse&quot; which had chocolate dipped frosting over a cake 

and chocolate *mousse* filling in the shape of a little critter...
The thing which totally filled my heart with joy was her message 
written on the box...She had to leave before he came home from 
school so she wrote &quot;For Richard for his S day, love Grandma&quot;
It is so rare that my mom backs me up actively on issues that are 
important to me... She is always there for me in many ways, but 
superficially there's always alot of conflict with us, especially 
over control issues (anyone have a similar relationship with their 
mom? LOL) The fact that she overtly acknowledged NoS as a serious 
and important part of *both* my and Richards life, was a breath of 
fresh air, and felt like a major victory in gaining her respect for 
my personal choice :)
It may seem like such a small thing to some of you, but without the 
full support of those who love you, it is just an uphill battle, and 
it's much easier when you know they are rooting you on :)
Well, suffice it to say, he ate the mouses head and I said, the rest 
had to wait till Saturday :)
(and I ate the mouses neck! :)
Hope you are all feeling great today, and I plan on buying a mug 
very soon, and probably a magnet too :) Good to hear they are a big 
hit so far! :)
Love,
Debbie
ps...Juliejoolio, I agree that the delicious apple crisp was an S 
and I don't use artificial sweeteners anymore, even splenda... so 
next time I will just restrain my urge an extra couple of days :)
