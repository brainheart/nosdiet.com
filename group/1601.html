Does your son's father or either set of grandparents have an input into 
how
he is being brought up? Try a family conference including your son. I agree
that medication is a problem in young people. they don't always respond 
like
adults. In fact one of the ADHD drugs acts as a stimulant in adults. If 
you
can get psycho- therapy for your son in some way that doesn't cost too
much,(Here in Britain we have our ~NHS to protect us). perhaps from a church
or other charitable organisation try that. Depression can respond to
counselling therapies, if you can build up your son's self esteem I'm sure
that will help. Can he volunteer for something. Playing ball games with
little kids perhaps. Does he play football or baseball? Helping little 
ones
perhaps teaching ball skills and getting them to like and respect him would
be great for him and getting outdoors is better than sitting in and getting
sadder I'm sure he will do well in the end with a loving mother to show 
him
how life can be Can he be your &quot;trainer for no-S&quot;? helping Mom 
succeed
could give him an aim. Meantime loads of praise for positive behaviours 
and
however much he pretends to hate it most kids love hugs. My daughter still
comes up and says &quot;Mummy cuddle&quot; and she doesn't live here any 
more.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i would like to say thanks to hanna and deb for their support and 
kindness
&gt; regarding my son's LD's. ms hanna, i thank you for sharing your
daughter's
&gt; story with me at a time when i really needed hope. you gave me hope, and 
i
didn't
&gt; have to have sugar. today we saw a counselor, and found out that my son 
is
&gt; depressed....if someone asks you to do something that is impossible 
daily
for 7
&gt; years, i guess that anger and frustration can become depression. so 
now,
we are
&gt; needing to add a round of antidepressants to his daily Adderall which 
he
take
&gt; for ADHD. it is my belief that physicians overmedicate , particularly
&gt; psychotropic drugs....i have to ask myself, does he really need all 
of
this chemical
&gt; intervention ? i am in the process of getting the school situation
&gt; fixed...will this be enough? am i doing him an injustice if i withhold
antidepressants? i
&gt; am a single mom and making all of these decisions by myself is really
hard.
&gt; thanks for listening . i would appreciate any input.. thanks noSer's
donna o
&gt;
