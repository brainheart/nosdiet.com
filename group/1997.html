&gt; I lost 50 pounds over the last 2 years. I, like most people just
&gt; realized one day, I needed to lose weight. Then I'd lose weight 
&gt; and it would come back. UGH! Last summer I stumbled across Dr. 
Brian Alman and keep-it-off.

That's great Jamie :)
I briefly checked out the site, and may investigate further...We'll 
see, it doesn't seem like too much of an investment to buy the book, 
but I think I'd rather peek at it at Barnes and Noble to see if 
he &quot;speaks my language&quot;
The idea of self hypnosis is something that has interested me in the 
past, and I tend to agree that unless you reach the root of a 
problem, and really resolve whatever issue is there to resolve, you 
maybe be trying to fight a losing battle for long term success. The 
acronym he used about &quot;awareness, acceptance..&quot; etc. reminds me of 

the work of Dr. Randolph Stone who was the founder of Polarity 
Therapy...his 4 step program was something like &quot;awareness, 
ownership, trust..&quot; something else....I have to look it up...
Anyway, self knowledge is key to change, so kudos to you for having 
the guts to look deeper :)
So 50 lbs is great! I'm sure that if you stick with NoS there 
should be no regaining your weight again...It is very maintenence 
driven and a solace to all &quot;regainers&quot; amongst us :)
Peace,
Deb
