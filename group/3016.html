Haha, I guess you could say I've been lurking around. I ran into this website a 
couple of months back and decided I had to join. I enjoy just reading the little 
notes and what not...
I'm thinking about going to study at the ucheepines institute (www.ucheepines.org), 
they heal all sorts of stuff over there with natural techniques instead of chemo. 
Nice meeting you though, gotta get off this lunch break.

&gt; Did you know that a fast for a meal or two is very beneficial 
during the flu? It allows the stomach rest and the body to use its 
energy to ward off the disease. After the fever has left, a diet of 
oranges or any type of citrus is very beneficial. By all means stay 
away from sugar as this tends to decrease the white blood cell count 
and weaken the immune sytem. Leave at the bedside only citrus, and 
if he craves sweets have him know that the fruit will help him 
recover. Right now in my family everyone is sick. I am fasting for 
religious purposes, and they accuse me of not eating enough and that 
I'll become sick. However the truth be told, they eat tons more than 
me and their bodies haven't been able to resist the flu. 
&gt; Hope this helps

.....Hi there Chris! Thanks for the suggestions... They are a 
little bit after the fact, because that virus is now weeks past and 
done with! LOL :)
I'm right there with you regarding the diverting of energy towards 
healing... I had written a post a while back explaining the health 
benefits of a juice fast, and I am fully aware that the process of 
digestion demands lots of the bodies energy...
I notice that you are of Chinese descent (or married into a Chinese 
family) Well I have nothing but the highest regard for Traditional 
Chinese Medicine and I studied the 5 Elements Model in my massage 
school, and learned all the acupuncture meridians... The body is 
amazing and the Eastern perspective of health is, in my opinion, and 
from what somewhat limited understanding I have, really the most 
comprehensive and intelligent....
It's really interesting that you are posting this &quot;Fasting&quot; topic 

letter today since I just had the idea today to do a juice fast from 
Wed till Friday or Saturday... I have never done this before and I 
am excited to see how it makes me feel...
Did you just join NoS? Or have you been &quot;lurking&quot;?
Feel free to write me at my email and let me know how your fast 
goes :)
God Bless!
Peace,
Deb
