Thanks Google :)
Well I decided to look for an article which could explain some of 
the chemistry/endocrinology, behind the Calcium/fat burning mechanism
that Carrie introduced to us before :) This article gets 5 stars 
from me...
I highly recommend reading this little mini lesson on how the brain 
and the body are put &quot;out of synch&quot; when we are carrying loads of 

extra weight... Yes, it does more than 2 minutes to read and really 
have all these facts sink in, as opposed to a quick promo from a 
yogurt ad (and don't get me wrong... I love yogurt, especially Brown 
cow and Stoneyfield Farm, ha ha there's a little plug from me!)
But this article also goes into detail about many other issues 
relating to bad eating habits, that have been voiced on this list, 
such as snacking, craving sweets, eating out of stress, and eating 
at night.. It does a great job of explaining some of the &quot;whys&quot; of 

all those subjects...It's not hard to read and I think it is very 
NoS approved. If you look at the &quot; 5 rules&quot; to live by, and the 

main &quot;culprits&quot; of weight gain, you will see that they are pretty 

much NOS stuff...You will see evidence that NoS is a very 
scientifically driven diet (not just fad science like Reinhard 
mentions in his &quot;gratuitous potshots&quot; section of the manifesto 
:)
Hope these explanations give further fire to all your resolutions to 
change these bad habits, I am definitely in a better mindset to 
change them now that I've read this!
Hope the link works. 
Check it out :)!
Peace love and the pursuit of knowledge.
Debbie
