...Kirstie, puleese! Not one of your posts, in my opinion could be 
considered clutter, and I have enjoyed your presence. Besides, who 
cares about being such a neat freak about the appearance of your 
inbox anyway? As long as you are working on your habits. Isn't that 
our main mission here? I thought this was a support group! Not 
postaholics anonymous! LOL :)
I tend to write a lot too, though I have cut my posts from (heh heh) 
at times 8 a day, to now 3 to 5 LOL :) It's not like you are all 
going off on a totally unrelated blog concerning some obscure topic 
like; the mating habits of the dodo bird!
Also, to quote a friend (you know who you are) this isn't 
&quot;Mao's China&quot;... It would be a real shame if people started to feel 

guilty or as if they were walking on eggshells because they 
are &quot;adding to clutter&quot; simply because they want to keep the 

conversation lively and ask questions... 
Otherwise it might turn into a pretty boring place.
Probably the most important part of this site for me is I can get my 
feelings out and really get helpful support...
Keep posting Coffee girl! We love you and need someone to have 
coffee with! (rather than someone who would sedate us into a 
confused slumber,,,snore...... LOL)
Love,
Deb :)
