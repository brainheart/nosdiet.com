Aw Bonnie, that would be a killer for me if I had to be around ice 
cream as part of my job... While I was going to school this time 
round, I had two part time jobs, one at a great bagel place, and the 
other was Starbucks...Talk about constant tempatation...I would never 
choose to put myself in a food service job again, it was a major 
eating trap, esp. Starbucks! All they had to choose from was 
pastries, so after 3 months I was completely a carb addict.
At least I hated their coffee because those mix drinks they have are 
pretty laden with sugar too.
That whole argument about how sugary treats lead to an addictive-like 
reaction is pretty true.
Since they don't give you any long term sustinance and make your 
blood sugar go up and down to extremes, you don't feel 
satisfied...Then you wind up one or two hours later with that 
hungry &quot;craving something&quot; feeling, and guess what you wind up 

wanting? Protein, fiber and fat are necessary to feel satisfied, as 
well as an adequate intake of water.
So your son's an unadulterated hippie? 
Cool : )
What about you? They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree!
I still remember, as a kid, hearing Uncle Johns Band and thinking 
that it didn't sound like anything I ever heard before. My baby 
boomer uncle was responsible for passing on the music to me.
That is my kind of comfort food!
&quot;Jerry, Jerry....&quot;

&gt; Dear Debbie,
&gt; Can't stop walking because it does keep me from gaining, and I 
do lose a

steady and
&gt; sure, has been losing a pound a week, watches the carbs, and his 
only
&gt; downfall is we sell ice cream in our shop, but in spite of it ,the 

walking
&gt; really works great for him in spite of the occasional cone....well, 

soon the
&gt; ice cream -hence temptation season- will be over. No, I enjoy my 
walks we
&gt; have a great time all chatting and staying healthy every morning, 

before we
&gt; must stay coped up working all day. By the way, you guessed it, 
my &quot;cute&quot;
&gt; son is a total hippie, and has been since he was born, and a Dead 

Head. He
&gt; follows the Dead alot, and his music, what he doesn't compose 
himself, is a
&gt; lot of Grateful Dead, Blue Grass, &amp; 70's.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Valerie :)
&gt; I am curious to know what stuff you are craving from this vending
&gt; machine? If its sweets, or salty stuff? Crunchy stuff etc...Or is
&gt; it just that you cant handle the impulse thing that happens when you
&gt; walk by?
&gt; I feel that if your meal is really great, and even borderline
&gt; fattening, you will not be as hungry as to need a snack. But
&gt; probably you are just seeing the machine and going into a programmed
&gt; response of getting something, we all have that in us.
&gt; I suggest just staying out of that area if possible...Is that the
&gt; only place you can eat your lunch? Can you do an al fresco thing?
&gt; Like Reinhard said, this is all about &quot;delay&quot;
&gt; Probably 90 percent or maybe more, of our need to eat unplanned food
&gt; is just an impulsive reaction...Why beat yourself up like you
&gt; committed one of the seven deadly sins? When something looks
&gt; inviting it's very normal to want it.
&gt; If I go to Dunkin Donuts with my son, it is like torture for me and
&gt; usually I get something for both of us when this happens.
&gt; It's a trap that can be avoided.
&gt; Think of those vending machines as irresistable, recognize that they
&gt; are interfering with your goal of long term success
&gt; (If you really are going to the machine 2 x's a day this is a pretty
&gt; obvious hindrance to your goal) You don't have to trick your brain
&gt; you have to just avoid the situation alltogether so your poor brain
&gt; has a break.
&gt; Are you hungry when these impulses arive? Or is it just pure visual
&gt; temptation? If you are infact hungry, probably you are skimping on
&gt; good meals.
&gt; If you really must eat that unhealthy snack try to make it part of
&gt; your meal, something that is planned into your three meals 
lifestyle,
&gt; like Reinhard says in the homepage info...At least you will be 
making
&gt; it part of your meal, and not further influencing that snacking
&gt; inbetween behavior...Then, to add bang for the buck, eat only half 

or
&gt; 2/3 of the irresistable snack, very very very slowly and throw the
&gt; rest away.
&gt; If you are not 100% with all three of our
&gt; Three commandments
&gt; No Sugar
&gt; No Snacks
&gt; No Seconds
&gt; that is normal...You are not an android...Figure out which rule is
&gt; the most challenging, and doing you the most damage, and really
&gt; garner all your hard artillery to figure out how you can make that
&gt; one stick.
&gt; Also, you might think of leaving your petty cash at home so you
&gt; simply cant buy those snacks.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope these ideas help :)
&gt; Good luck

&gt; &gt; Okay, I'm really in trouble now...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Every day this week, I've broken the rules. So I need to start
&gt; over. The
&gt; &gt; old diet mentality says start over on Tuesday, because Friday 
is
&gt; only one
&gt; &gt; weekday, then there are the two S days when the rules don't
&gt; strictly apply,
&gt; &gt; then there's another &quot;S&quot; (special) day, Labor Day. So I might 
as
&gt; well wait
&gt; &gt; and start the three-week count on Tuesday.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I started No S a month ago and had been doing well, really 
enjoying
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; structure, etc. Then for some reason on Monday, I looked at the
&gt; vending
&gt; &gt; machine in the break room at work and realized it had been almost 

a
&gt; month
&gt; &gt; since I'd bought anything from it. And wouldn't you know, for 
the
&gt; rest of
&gt; &gt; the day, all I kept thinking about was what was in that vending
&gt; machine.
&gt; &gt; Eventually, I bought something from it, and every day this week,
&gt; I've bought
&gt; &gt; something from it twice a day.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The brain is really tricky. I keep trying to outsmart myself, 
but
&gt; the more
&gt; &gt; I try to resist, the more I can't stop thinking about it and 
the
&gt; more I give
&gt; &gt; in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks.
&gt; &gt;
