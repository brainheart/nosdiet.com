Wow Tammy! Sounds like you've got your hands full. Maybe you could find ways to 
squeeze in exercise later in the day or during the kids' nap time. Any little bit of 
physical activity will do some good. Don't be discouraged if you're not losing as 
fast as others. I'm still hovering within a few ounces of my same old weight. But at 
least I'm not gaining. Don't give up!!!!!

HI, 
I think it is great you lost so much weight, but I was wondering do you exercise to 
and if so how much. I have a in home daycare and I have 6kids the oldest 3 and I 
really have to keep my eyes on them all the time, so I dont get to ex. everday. I 
guess I'm feeling like I will never lose this weight.




Thanks for listening.Tammy

I'm looking at this as a permanent way to eat. It feels balanced and sensible to me. 
I've been following it since late july and I've lost about 15 or 20 pounds, that's 
one trousers size. Its the first time I've worn size 36 jeans, comfortably, in years. 
Not bad, eh?

Brian
