Well folks, the best laid plans of mice and me....
I had a topsy turvey day guys...Started out with some problems, 
which carried over from this weekend with my part-time/on call 
job... by 11:00 today I found myself writing a letter of 
resignation... I was bummed out and had absolutely no appetite so 
all my meals were totally thrown off and I had breakfast when I 
should have had lunch etc... then I got a call for a new private 
client, and the appoinment was when I usually prepare dinner...blah 
blah blah etc..... you get where this is going...
So I say 90% because the only S that I violated was that I didn't 
really structure my food onto my usual 3 plates for 3 meals and 
maybe I would have eaten less if I wasn't so ravenous by the time 
dinner did roll around...bad organization, but with all the stress, 
I did wind up only ordering a large hamburger with Richard at a very 
popular fast food place known as McGrease...However no fries, no 
shake and no soda *annnnd* we had leftover m&amp;m's in my glove 
compartment from yesterday (S day) and I didn't even eat one 
little &quot;m&quot;!!!!
I am still giving myself a slash in my 21 day trek across the 
calendar...Tomorrow I will make sure to sit down and consciously 
have meal time, even if it's only a few minutes at the table....
Seltzer is still helping... I had some chicken broth with my dinner 
(thanks Diane for the good tip, but boo it had loads of msg!)
Considering that this morning was pretty much as close as one can 
get to a full blown panic attack, because of the job scenario, today 
could have been way worse and I am happy that I stuck to most of the 
rules :)
Hasta Manana Amigos :)
Paz,
Debita
