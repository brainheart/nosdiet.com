Good afternoon everyone,

Feeling a little shaky right now (will I EVER get this 'right'), so I 
decided to check in. Starting again for the umpteenth time...

So far so good today. I am determined to cross this day off as a strict 

No-S day.

3:00 pm is the time I really start watching the clock at work and getting 

the urge to snack. So I am posting this and having a cup of green tea with 

Equal instead of letting the snacking urge build up until I give in.

Diane -- the comments you made earlier really helped me:

&gt;&gt;Remember Winston Churchill's famous speech? =) (If not, I'll quote it 

&gt;&gt;next time.)

I don't remember. Please quote it next time.

&gt;&gt;Like you, sitting at my desk at work is the most difficult time, if the 

&gt;&gt;work is boring (and it usually is). My reasons for snacking (especially 

&gt;&gt;on sweets) have always been (in descending order):

&gt;&gt;1. I'm bored
&gt;&gt;2. I'm overwhelmed/frustrated/annoyed
&gt;&gt;3. I'm tired

&gt;&gt;For me, &quot;boredom&quot; doesn't mean I have nothing to do; it means I am 
forced 
&gt;&gt;to work on something that doesn't interest me at all (most of my jobs are 

&gt;&gt;like that--good money but not very intellectually stimulating). Once in a 

&gt;&gt;while I have gotten totally involved in a project that interested me, and 

&gt;&gt;I actually forgot to eat. This hasn't happened often but it was nice when 

&gt;&gt;it did--it showed me how much the issue depends on my mind and not my 

&gt;&gt;body.

EXACTLY!! I am a technical writer for a large IT company, and I work on 

some of the most boring stuff imaginable -- requirements definition 
documents, procedure manuals -- stuff nobody really wants to read. I have 

plenty to do, but nothing I'm particularly interested in...

&gt;Yesterday I was really hungry an hour before lunch, and finally I ate a 

&gt;packet of peanuts. Then at lunchtime I wasn't hungry and couldn't properly 

&gt;enjoy the free lunch provided by the office! Another lesson learned. If 

&gt;we learn from each mistake, the failure will have some redeeming value.

I agree. Thanks for sharing Diane.

Hope everyone else is having a good day.

Valerie
