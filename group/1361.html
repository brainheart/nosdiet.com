For the evening, call it another meal and have loads of finger sized pieces
of raw veggies, carrots, zucchini,cauliflower, bell peppers lettuce,tomatoes
in the fridge in ice water. they will be crisp and delocious and give you
loads of vitamins and fibre into the bargain I often do this and sometimes
have fruit too.

&gt; Hi Cat
&gt;
&gt; This is a hard one, especially if you have family and you keep 'bad'
&gt; things in the house for them! You could try a couple of tactics: make
&gt; sure that you eat well at your last meal of the day so that you can 
say
&gt; to yourself that you don't need anything else and find yourself plenty
&gt; of things to do that will keep your mind off food. If you're having
&gt; problems with items such as sweets or snacks maybe you could keep 
them
&gt; in something like a red tin or a cupboard that you have no other reason
&gt; to visit. If I see food then I want to eat it so keeping it out of
&gt; eyesight helps a lot. The red tin happened by accident but it's become
&gt; a bit of a stop signal for me now - it gives me a chance to ask myself
&gt; if I really want to eat what's in it before I've seen it.
&gt;
&gt; hth
&gt;
&gt; best wishes
