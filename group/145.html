This is Bonnie again. I am 60 years old and just walking , briskly, but 
at
our age we cant be jogging, and combined with the &quot;S&quot; diet , I am 
losing
weight without having to give up the other things I love like bread
-fruit-cheese-wine.
Forgetting sugar is very easy for me, and if I really crave something, 
I
just remind myself...Sat I can have it. This diet is working.

Hi Tammy,

The selling point of this diet is not speed, and diet
alone isn't going to be enough long term. Though I did
manage to lose 20 pounds in 2 months on the nosdiet,
which I think is pretty fast, without much exercise, I
think that's a bit unusual. Since I started walking
for at least an hour a day and shovelgloving, I lost
an additional 15 pounds, and probably more if you are
just considering pounds of fat. 

Exercise is critical, but that doesn't mean you have
to slave away at the gym for hours every day. Most
people are just not realistically going to be able to
do this. Just start walking. It's so important to do
*something.* You can always up the routine later. And
walking is useful, interesting, and safe.

See

if you need additional inspiration.

Good luck,

Reinhard

&gt; HI, 
&gt; I think it is great you lost so much weight, but I
&gt; was wondering do you exercise to and if so how much.
&gt; I have a in home daycare and I have 6kids the oldest
&gt; 3 and I really have to keep my eyes on them all the
&gt; time, so I dont get to ex. everday. I guess I'm
&gt; feeling like I will never lose this weight.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for listening.Tammy

&gt; following it since late july and I've lost about 15

&gt; first time I've worn size 36 jeans, comfortably, in
&gt; years. Not bad, eh?
