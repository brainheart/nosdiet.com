I had an entire pound of peanut butter M&amp;Ms yesterday.

They are, needless to say, one of my main weaknesses.

&gt; Dear Group,
&gt; 
&gt; All was going well until I went out for the first time in months to a 

&gt; Valentine's dinner dance last night. While waiting for the food to come, 

&gt; I toyed 
&gt; with the little silver and red foil wrapped chocolates scattered across
&gt; the 
&gt; table. After all, it was an S-day, right? Besides, I was feeling so
&gt; good 
&gt; after several No S weeks with modest weekends, thanks to my dear husband
&gt; who 
&gt; bought only what I put on the list while I recuperated from bronchial 

&gt; pneumonia.
&gt; 
&gt; Soon I was out of control and didn't even know it until I was looking 

&gt; around 
&gt; for more, and by then I didn't care, for myself, but started sneaking 

&gt; because of those around me.
&gt; 
&gt; Ate dinner, followed by cake and coffee and before leaving stuffed 
another
&gt; piece of cake in a plastic cup for tomorrow, which I ate as soon as I 
got
&gt; home 
&gt; even though I felt uncomfortably full. Slept fitfully until 4 a.m., 
and
&gt; now 
&gt; I'm paying the price with rumbling and discomfort for what I did to 
myself
&gt; in three hours of self indulgence.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what I wrote to the old familiar tune:
&gt; 
&gt; Candy and cake
&gt; Candy and cake 
&gt; My stomach is feeling sick from eating 
&gt; Candy and cake
&gt; 
&gt; Sugar and fat
&gt; Why'd I do that?
&gt; I'm oh so sick from eating too much
&gt; Candy and cake.
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome new members, hope you don't do as I did.
&gt; May everyone go S-easy today.
&gt; 
&gt; Love,
&gt; 
&gt; Ginny
