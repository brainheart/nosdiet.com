----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Jennifer Dunbabin&quot; &lt;jenniferdunbabin@...&gt;
[snip] there were times during the day that I thought I would muck up, but 

then it would pass. it is still such a mystery what prompts the need I 
have.

This reminds me of a suggestion I've been intending to share. I used to 

have really strong cravings which would derail my diets time after time 

(hence, that &quot;willpower&quot; question, LOL), but after I started using some 

great supplements, my cravings went away entirely. I was left only to deal 

with my *habits,* which is another thing entirely, but at least I didn't 

have those mysterious cravings propelling me toward the refrigerator. You 

know that feeling where you're standing and looking in, wanting *something,* 

but you don't know what... Well, now I believe that is our bodies telling 

us that we really *do* need something which we haven't given it yet. My 

personal experience proved that it wasn't all in my head.

After a lot of reading, I have concluded that it's probably minerals which 

are most important. Trace minerals are very difficult to obtain in our 

mass-produced, over-processed food. You don't need a lot of any one 
mineral, but you do need them all. I use Cell Tech products 
(www.celltech.com) but even if you try a high-quality supplement that 
contains a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, it could help. Give it at 

least 2-3 months to decide whether it's helping, though it will probably 

make a difference sooner.

For a few dollars, you can also check out &quot;No More Cravings&quot; by Douglas 

Hunt, MD, in which he describes the links he has observed between specific 

cravings and specific minerals. Go to Amazon here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4fc65">http://tinyurl.com/4fc65</a> 

(I have even programmed it to give Reinhard the credit!).

Hope this might help someone,
Diane
