The thing I hate about Aspatame is the taste. I find it foul even in small
quantities. Saccharine, I find tastes better and Splenda is almost nice.
The best thing though is to take unsweetened drinks, tea and coffee is 
easy,
but for during the working day, it is nice to dilute pure fruit juice 50/50
with water for a real thirst quencher.It's particularly good if chilled.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Haven't we beaten aspartame to death on the list already? Anyone
&gt; can file a lawsuit. We *know* that a lot of people think aspartame 
is
&gt; &gt; poisonous; we also know that no-one's actually been able to
&gt; *demonstrate* Suing CIA, Madonna over mind
&gt; &gt; Rich Lafferty
&gt;
&gt; Hi Rich, you seem pretty sure that aspartame arguments are all
&gt; conspiricy theories of the same ilk as the above mentioned &quot;Madonna
&gt; sues CIA&quot; (that is funny)
&gt; It is a bit upsetting to me because it seems pretty
&gt; reactionary...Could there be a grain of truth, or even more to the
&gt; claims about aspartame and splenda and all of those artificial
&gt; sweeteners being detrimental to the body? I am guessing you consume
&gt; equal or nutrasweet in some form, let me know if this assumption is
&gt; wrong.
&gt; I used equal for around 4 years...Not lot's mind you..Maybe about 
4
&gt; to 6 packs a day, in my coffee...I assumed because it was so
&gt; commonly found in everything, it must be fairly safe...I think that
&gt; was a wrong assumption...I should mention too, that during those
&gt; years I suffered from intense headaches, allergies, bad bouts of
&gt; bronchitis which would last for very long periods of time, manic
&gt; behavior...I believe that the equal was playing a part in this, it
&gt; was screwing with the integrity of the CNS somehow...Once I read the
&gt; article which I will leave for you to read (it is in a post format,
&gt; but I read it in a different context, a health flyer I picked up in
&gt; my school) I decided to completely eliminate this product from my
&gt; life, because for me, it wasn't worth it if in the long run, *I*
&gt; wound up being the guinea pig in a long term experiment gone wrong.
&gt; I decided to try Splenda, which since they say it is a longer chain
&gt; of sugar, it seemed safer, but then I found some study which cast
&gt; doubt on that as well. I will tell you that after using Equal and
&gt; then stopping completely, I felt better in so many different ways,
&gt; and that all started to happen only within a few months...*My*
&gt; evidence was good enough to confirm my worries about aspartame...I
&gt; was less &quot;on edge&quot; all the time. I almost completely stopped
&gt; getting chronic cases of bronchitis. In general, my overall health
&gt; was better and I was alot less &quot;hyper&quot;
&gt; So sorry if you feel that I am continuing to beat this topic to
&gt; death. I think raising awareness doesn't need to be likened to the
&gt; lawsuit where Barney sues PBS for purple dye #47, and I did look at
&gt; your links, whose to judge whether they have any real merit or
&gt; truth..Scathing and pithy yes, but to me seemed very tabloidesque.
&gt; Empirical studies are really interesting too...Evidence can present
&gt; itself, but sometimes it can be interpreted from different views.
&gt; Depends who is presenting it right? Studies can finagle with facts,
&gt; and I would prefer to advocate on the side of really finding the
&gt; truth...
&gt; Do you remeber a time when it was commonly thought safe to smoke
&gt; regularly? And what was that drug that was popular for, was it
&gt; fertility?, in the 50's which wound up causing major birth defects 
?
&gt; What about the approval of the use of Agent Orange? They were all
&gt; billed &quot;safe&quot; at some point or another and sadly years later 
people
&gt; found out the truth.
&gt; People should not be the guinea pigs unless they are really aware 
of
&gt; the risks...I personally think, why not err on the side of
&gt; skepticism while the &quot;jury&quot; is out?
&gt; I'll put the link to the letter by Arthur Evangelista, a former FDA
&gt; investigator, at the bottom of this letter
&gt;
&gt; PS..What in blazes is the North Western Tree Octapus? LOL
