Thanks everyone for all of the great responses! I think that 
knowing more people who are trying to achieve what you are helps. 
I'm a member of another weight loss group, and when everyone says 
their weight, it makes me feel especially big, which is greater 
motivation. I also keep thinking of the first day of school, when I 
have to see everyone again, but I know I have at least two friends 
that I can count on! I guess I have even more motivation since my 
family and I are going to Atlanta at the end of August for a big 
convention. I'm going to meet alot of my Mom's friends, and I don't 
want to feel like the fat person in my family. But, I think it's 
going to be a bit easier. My mom is getting more serious on what 
she's eating (she's diebetic and got some numbers back, needless to 
say, they weren't the best) and my brother is on a health food 
craze. This diet seems to be the most sensible and easy one, one 
that I can do. So far I have done, what I thibk, pretty good. I 
like to think of myself as a very mature 15-year-old, especially 
when compared to some of the idiots my age. I got near ten awards 
at graduation, my mom said I won so many it was embarassing!! I 
even got a $50 savings bond from one of the awards! I know I'm a 
good person, I just hate always feeling so self-conscious (sp?). 
Anyways, I'll everyone get back to their lives!!

P.S. I've heard that doing some work around the house is good, even 
if it's not exercising. It still gets you up and moving, but I 
won't have any trouble with that today, I get to babysit my 16 month 
old niece again! I constantly run around the house with her! 
(that's good enough right?)

&gt; ---hi kimi
&gt; i gained my weight when i was 16 because i stopped running around 

and 
&gt; being a tom boy and started sitting home and snacking . the more i 

&gt; thought about losing weight the more i ate.. til i was 145
&gt; then i started college and ate more junk i used to buy like six 
&gt; donuts instead of one so people wouldnt think i was buying my self 

a 
&gt; donut. how silly is that. and then eat six.. it was awful
&gt; i ended up at about 160 my first year at college and 195 by the 
time 
&gt; i graduated ..i have spent my entire rest of my life on a diet 
trying 
&gt; to lose the weight.. and never being able to enjoy eating without 

&gt; feeling guilty or saying no i cant eat that.....and being a party 

&gt; pooper around my friends.. so maybe on this diet..i can eat with 
my 
&gt; friends and still lose weight.. i find i am NOT hungry on this 
diet.. 
&gt; just have to break the shoving food in your mouth habit and plan 
for 
&gt; a meal .. knowing i can pretty much eat what i want( excluding 
sugar) 
&gt; is a new experience for me . i do find i am making fairly healthy 

&gt; choices i think i will respond well to finally being free of all 
the 
&gt; guilt 
&gt; but if you can do this diet and develop healthy habits of not 
&gt; snacking and not eating sugar or artificial sweetners and not 
eating 
&gt; seconds you will be well on your way 
&gt;
