welcome annie

the concept, the activity is simple ...... but thinking it, stating it 
and
distributing it in this day and age I don't think was easy. I like it cos 
it
is subversive as well, it thumbs its nose at current social mores,
materialism, capitalism, socialism .... enough of that

I too have a substantial journey to make. Because I haven't weight myself
for sometime I am not sure exactly what it is, but I need to lose at least
half my body weight and that weight is large.

I am so glad you have medication that has set you free from immobility,
though I guess you still have pain. Now we are both working to set ourselves
free from the prison of very excessive poundage.

what is curves?

does landofoz me u r from australia? so am I, I live in Hobart.

love

jen

Dear Debra,

I did not see that episode but thanks for the laugh. I am new to nosdiet
and I have every intention to stick to this because it sounds so simple. 
I
know I have willpower. Or let me say I am now ready to take it off the
shelf! I am so looking forward to this because I need to loose about 250
pounds and I am not proud of that at all. I gained alot after Severe
Rhuematoid Arthritis put a stop to any movement my body has ever made. 
I
have lived with this condition for 13 yrs and they now finally have
medications that make me feel like excercising again and just get moving. 
I
Thank God when I stumbled on to your page. Thank You, Thank You, Thank 
You
and i hope to hear from you soon. Will keep you posted and maybe you can
help me learn how to share with everyone else. oh I also signed up @ Curves
so I can try to loose about 2lbs a week. Think of me and say a prayer. 
Bye
for now.

Landofoz - Annie

Hey everone :)
I was thinking how helpful it is to be part of this group and have
that much needed &quot;lifeline&quot; of support.
Knowing that we are all in this together makes it really nice.

Yesterday as I was pondering this first idea when I had a flashback
to that old episode of The Flintstones when Fred decides to join
overeaters anonymous...That scene where he is about to eat a whole
turkey in the middle of the night, and his group leader catches him
in the act by peeping into the window. Then he snatches the turkey
out the window using a bow and arrow attached to a string,
accompanied by an official group &quot;alarm sound&quot; that resembles 
a
turkey blowing a &quot;raspberry&quot; I couldn't stop laughing.

If you didn't see it well I guess you had to in order to laugh.
It is a visual joke.

But if you did let me know...I was cracking up thinking about it
(juvenille sense of humor that I have LOL)

Our group reminds me of that
Without the club turkey call of course :)
It's like we are monitoring everything together, even in our
&quot;middle of the night&quot; moments..Which I think is great, actually.
Some people I have been emailing directly, have mentioned that they
read every post and try to gain wisdom from what they have read. And
it sure beats paying 15 dollars a week to join Weight Watchers
Except for Reinhard that is, sorry coach, I did look at your post
about residual &quot;revenue&quot; and I did, infact, feel &quot;sorry for you&quot; 
LOL

Shovelglovving went really well today, but it is 3 or 4 hours later
now and I am still totally floored from the amount of energy
expended during those, very, very, long 14 minutes. Now I am in
full shlepping mode, and slowing down more and more with every
passing moment. The 14 minutes was just enough time to listen to
Good Times Bad Times, Your time is gonna come, and most of I Can't
Quit Her..PS Rondelle, whole lotta love is on Led Zep II
And I'm gonna do it again tomorrow, because I think I am a glutton
for punishment...In all honesty, like I told SG group right after,
it was really exhillarating...I liked it alot..But very demanding

&quot;Willlllmaaaaa&quot;
Love,
Deb
