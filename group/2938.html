&gt; I have joined all the groups of Everyday Systems and
&gt; am currently
&gt; following the NoSDiet (since Wednesday) and
&gt; UrbanRanger.

Welcome, Maheesh. As I mentioned in my everydaysystems
group welcome, I'm very excited to have another
multi-grouper. But do be careful not to overload
yourself by taking on too many new things at once. I
didn't (not by plan, but just because I didn't think
of them all at once). If you find you are running into
difficultly, you may want to stagger your starts a
bit.

&gt; Just seems like I am eating more than usual at those
&gt; 3 meals in the
&gt; fear of getting hungry in between (better safe than
&gt; sorry!)

You're doing the right thing. Develop the habit first.
Once you have that down you have a rock to build on.
It's much, much easier to address the problem of too
big portions once you have them down to a limited
number. As I've mentioned in the past, I found that
part so easy that I never even had to get systematic
about it.

&gt; I have not
&gt; lost any weight since Wednesday (check my weight
&gt; once a week) and that
&gt; is no surprise. Slow and steady. :-) 

It's amazing how many people would have been
surprised. I'm glad you weren't. Advertisements and
unhealthy quick fixes that we *know* are full of crap
and laugh at seem to somehow anyway affect our
expectations. Maybe their particular miracle product
or system is flawed, but somewhere out there one must
exist... This pernicious belief in dietary miracles is
an anti-miracle. It keeps us from taking the
necessary, obvious, hard but not that hard right
steps.

&gt; Today (Saturday) being an S day, I had 2 home-baked
&gt; chocolate chip
&gt; cookies. 

Excellent. Enjoying S days to the full is not a
concession, it's a fundamental pillar of this system.
Treats are *required*.

&gt; I go to the gym 3 times a week
&gt; (do the MAX-OT style
&gt; of weight training) and do cardio (recumbent bike at
&gt; home) 5 times a
&gt; week for 15 minutes (generally do 4 miles per
&gt; session). I have started
&gt; exercising consistently since Feb 1st. :-)

Consistency is the key. Your exercise systems sound
pretty hard core, which is great, but I think what you
do is much less important than the fact that you do it
regularly. I'm sure you know this, just a friendly
reminder.

Looking forward to hearing more,

Reinhard
