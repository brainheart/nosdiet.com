THROW YOUR GLASSES AWAY FOR LIFE! =0D

In less than eight weeks you could be reading or driving without your
glasses or contact lenses...and without surgery or strenuous eye exercises.
Now, thanks to an exciting program developed at

Graded on girth? =0D
=0D
It's no secret that we're a fat nation - the fattest in the world per capit=
a
And it's also no secret that we'll be even fatter in years to come, becaus=
e
obesity in our children is rampant. The question is: What to do about it? 
=
=0D
=0D
Some school districts around the country have taken small steps in the 
righ=
t
direction, like outlawing vending machines, desserts, and soda-pop.
Inexplicably, most of them still offer carb-heavy, nutrition-less entrees
like pizza, macaroni-n-cheese, and mashed potatoes in the cafeteria, though=
,
so I'm not sure if these token measures will have much of an impact... 
=0D
=0D
But now, instead of making meaningful changes in the way they FEED our
nation's kids, some schools are proposing that they simply pass the buck 
to
parents - by making a child's girth just another &quot;grade&quot; on their 
REPORT
CARD! =0D
=0D
Yep, you read that right: If lawmakers in Texas have their way, kids
statewide will have their BMI (Body Mass Index), this country's misguided
standard measure of obesity, listed on their report cards every term - 
in
effect &quot;grading&quot; them on their weight. In neighboring Arkansas, a 
similar
policy of reporting kids' BMI to parents is already a matter of law.
Needless to say, a lot of parents in both states are outraged, according 
to
MSNBC and other sources. I'm torn about this course of action. Here's why: 
=
=0D
=0D
On the one hand, studies have shown that parents have blinders on when 
it
comes to recognizing their own children's weight issues. It's an interestin=
g
phenomenon that I remember reading about somewhere - some parents literally
don't see the flab on their own kids, while being able to easily identify
other children that are overweight. So in this respect, a &quot;reality check&quot; 
o=
n
the report card might not be such a bad thing. =0D
=0D
But on the other hand, our schools tend to promote poor eating habits - 
lik=
e
the deadly, diabetes-causing USDA Food Pyramid. If kids all of sudden begin
taking their school's guidance more seriously because they're being &quot;graded=
&quot;
on their weight, they'll get EVEN FATTER, especially if they eat in the
school lunch-room. =0D
=0D
It's a Catch-22! =0D
=0D
Of course, what schools SHOULD do is teach truly healthy low-carbohydrate
and refined-sugar, high animal-fat and protein eating habits for young 
kids
- and stock their cafeterias accordingly. That, and revitalize the Phys-ed
programs that are going the way of the dinosaur in public schools everywher=
e
nowadays (kids are the one demographic that truly NEEDS a lot of exercise).=
=0D
=0D
But that's a lot to wish for, and na=EFve to think it could ever happen.
Instead, kids'll get report cards with &quot;fat&quot; grades on them and a bunch 
of
token measures at school that won't help in the least, and may even hurt.
Speaking of such, keep reading... =0D

Schools swap sugar for... More sugar! =0D
=0D
When I've written before about public schools making small changes in the
direction of healthier eating, I've rendered some tentative praise about
such measures. But along with these kudos, I've always mentioned the same
caveat: =0D
=0D
Such changes will be good things only if schools replace these foods and
drinks with consumables that are truly healthy. And one of the major
concerns along these lines I've mentioned before is schools' often-trumpete=
d
substitution of sweet fruit juices for soda-pop in vending machines: It's
simply exchanging one type of sugar-water for another. This helps nothing.
Now, I know what you're thinking: &quot;Come on doc - ANY kind of fruit juice 
is
better than a Coke, right?&quot; =0D
=0D
You be the judge. According to a recent Associated Press article,
researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
concluded that daily consumption of &quot;sweet drinks&quot; contributed to 
an
increased risk of obesity among children - especially the younger ones. 
And
what many parents (and schools) would no doubt find shocking is that
according to the research, fruit juices were JUST AS MUCH TO BLAME for 
this
increased risk as things like Kool-Aid and Coca-Cola! =0D
=0D
I hate to say &quot;I told you so,&quot; but I did. Repeatedly. So, what should 
they
put in vending machines instead of fruit juice and soda-pop? How about 
this=
:
NOTHING! GET RID OF THEM! =0D
=0D
They'll never do this, though... =0D
=0D
There's simply too much money to be made from turning our kids into obese,
sugar-craving lumps of dullness and inactivity - and too easy to blame
parents for it. =0D
=0D
Giving our schools an &quot;F&quot; when it comes health, =0D
