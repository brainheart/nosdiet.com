Good Morning Everyone,
I have one regret this a.m. and that is that i didnt weigh before i 
started. I know i have lost this week i can feel it. I was at the 
mall last night shopping for a birthday present for my big sis and 
was getting excited that i will have to buy some new clothes. YAH !!
I will see her tonight for dinner and am going to share this with 
her more extensively, she and my mom need something to live by daily
(diet wise) and still enjoy life as we nossers do.Her family was 
hard struck by Hurricane Charley so i know its been terribkly hard 
to find time to excersise let alone eat right when you couldn't 
even live in your home.They used to go to Curves but quit after the 
Hurricane series LOL. They are now back in their home after 65 days 
of frustration,despair and repair. Anyway, this plan is so SIMPLE I 
CAN HARDLY BELIEVE ITS NOT BEEN MARKETED(JOKING REINHARD) I can tell 
you truly want to help people,give them a key to a healthy life. But 
you could be the next John Basedow. you do have better looks than 
him and are in just as good or better physical condition.Hope I am 
not overstepping myself:) Sorry, I am a bit punchy this a.m. for 
some reason, LOLOLOL. Just happy i guess. After all it is SS days 
coming.well i will quit blabbering TTYL Julie
