Hi Tom,

I meant leftover Easter candy. No sacrilege=A0on this diet :-).

Your wife's dump at work strategy is probably better than anything I
mentioned -- except=20
for the coworkers, of course. And it seems to have been followed by
quite a few people in=20
my office...

&gt; Hello;
&gt;=20
&gt; Resist Easter candy? On Easter? That's sacreligous (sp?).
&gt;=20
&gt; I had been looking forward to Easter candy for a long time. So on
Easter I=20
&gt; went to the store and bought one bag of each of the kinds I
remembered from=20
&gt; childhood: the big, hard, colored egg ones with the white in the
middle,=20
&gt; chocolate malt eggs, and some regular jelly bean eggs. My goal was
to eat=20
&gt; myself sick. When I got home at my first sitting I got too full
before I could feel=20
&gt; bad. I went outside and worked in the garden. At suppertime I came
in, had a=20
&gt; big supper and then attacked the bags again. I had better luck this
time. Pretty=20
&gt; soon I was not feeling so good. So I stopped. I was happy and
uncomfortable.
&gt;=20
&gt; There was a half a bag each ot the three kinds left. I wanted to
throw them=20
&gt; away; my wife took them to the people at her work.
&gt;=20
&gt; I'm ok now.
&gt;=20
&gt; I plan on doing the same thing next year. Oh yeah, one more thing 
-
candy=20
&gt; corn at Halloween . . . .
&gt;=20
