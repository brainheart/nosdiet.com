&gt; Hi Deb, You do seem full of energy. 

D...yeah sometimes too much LOL

I wish you could pass some 
&gt; onto me. 

D...You are more than welcome to it! LOL 
In all seriousness, I don't really have that much energy, I just 
have a deficit of energy where it really counts in my Water element.
Heres a very very oversimplistic description taken from Trad Chinese 
medicine:
The Fire element is the Heart, Pericardium, Small Intestine, and 
something known as the Triple Heater..The Heart in Eastern thought 
is believed to be what houses the &quot;Shen&quot; or the &quot;Mind&quot;, very 

different than our Western belief that the Mind is in the Brain 
itself. The Water element in the body consists of Kidney and 
Bladder, and the Brain and Central Nervous System are believed to 
stem from and be nurtured by the Kidneys. So Water should be, under 
optimal conditions, alway controlling Fire, keeping it in check, so 
to speak. Just like a microcosm of the way it is in nature. If not 
it is common to have &quot;Shen&quot; disturbances at night, when the &quot;Shen&quot; 

is now wandering around aimlessly, causing insomnia and frequent 
dreams...
I ain't got good Kidneys folks, and it runs in the family.

I like to read before I sleep, this relaxes me, helps me 
&gt; unwind. 

D...That is a great idea Lee :) Maybe I should pick a REALLY boring 
book to make me fall asleep even faster LOL

I seem to be ok at night now which surprises me because I 
&gt; was a constant eater. 

D...I am happy to hear of your success on NO S
Thanks for helping me out :)
Peace,
Deb
