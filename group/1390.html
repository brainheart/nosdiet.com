Hi Debbie,

A funny thing about these late night temptations that
I've found: if you pull it off and resist them and
just go to sleep or distract yourself with a glass of
water or whatever, you'll wake up:

1) astonished that you were really that hungry

2) grateful for and proud of your escape. This feeling
is worth a lot. Try to weigh it against the salmon
snacks next time the urge hits.

That being said, shake it off. You didn't go totall
berserk, you didn't fool yourself. It's bad, but it's
not that bad. Get on with it. But I'm not too worried,
you sound like you have a great attitude.

Best of luck,

Reinhard

&gt; Hey last night I got a chance to walk the walk not
&gt; just talk the 
&gt; talk, and folks it's much harder than I realized to
&gt; really say
&gt; &quot;I am having a setback&quot;, not just going back into
&gt; that nightmarish 
&gt; cycle of &quot;I am screwing up, who am I fooling, I will
&gt; never change, 
&gt; what's the use&quot; and other
&gt; Non Useful diet prerecordings...They are such
&gt; ingrained horrible 
&gt; momentum killers...But in the end, I still consider
&gt; it only a little 
&gt; bump on the highway of success, and I am back on my
&gt; horse, and 
&gt; riding at quite a clip:)
&gt; Truth be told, it was a scary moment for me when it
&gt; happened. 
&gt; Imagined scenarios are good practice for a game
&gt; plan, but ain't 
&gt; nothing like the real thing. 
&gt; I was saying it but not really having an easy time
&gt; of it. I believed 
&gt; it but that voice was getting squelched by that
&gt; &quot;Gorilla&quot; that 
&gt; beautiful idiot talked about, hard to tell that
&gt; beast to leave you 
&gt; alone and have your setback in peace :)
&gt; I then thought, &quot;Hmmm could I consider that 1 am
&gt; binge on smoked 
&gt; salmon snacks, and cold leftover mac and cheese an
&gt; early breakfast?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Nice try
&gt; Play again :)
&gt; 
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb
