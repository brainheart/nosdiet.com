&gt; Thought I would start out w/an Austin Powers quote, to give you 
guys a general idea of what I am like (and to warn you too I suppose 
LOL).

.....You sound shagadellic, so oh behave! :)
Thanks for the warning, you can't be as corny as me, so I think we 
are safe :) Welcome!

&gt;my head is trying to sabotage me already by telling me it could not 

be this simple and that instead of losing weight I am going to just 
gain even more weight. 

....already giving up before you start? Don't worry. There are no 
guarantees, however you probably won't gain weight unless you eat 3 
meals a day of deep fried chicken and pancakes...Still, if it fits 
on a normal sized plate, even then, you probably wouldn't gain 
weight (whether or not you'd lose lot's might be questionable)
During the holidays the general reports from people were gains of 2 
lbs, that's all, and the holiday season is not known for it's 
tendency to make people become skinny! A testament to NoS even 
under special conditions....So put aside your worry, as you said, 
it's only 3 weeks and if it's so easy for you now, then you are just 
a nos natural, and it should get even easier!

&gt;but by not being on any sort of eating program now I run that risk 

regardless. 
....That's true, you will find that the life friendlyness of this 
way of eating is so much kinder and gentler than any other diet, it 
is slow, but it's for keeps, because it's maintainable :)
I have lost about 7 lbs since I began in September...Not alot, but 
if I wasn't on NoS I certainly could have gained 30 lbs since then, 
the way things had been going last year....Slow and steady wins the 
race :)

&gt; Anyway, hello everyone! Glad to be aboard here! Beth A very very 
VERY tired computer geek and Mommy to 8 month old twins
......Gee I wonder why you are tired? LOL
Well Reinhard is a computer geek, so you guys can trade hacker stuff 
as well as recipes :) Good luck Beth, especially with your twins... 
It may seem very far off now, but if you get your habits down now, 
then when it's time to combat the two of them screaming for cookies 
and candy at every stop, you may not even have to, because our kids 
develop habits from our example. So you are not only doing yourself 
a favor of getting in control, you are also helping your daughters :)
Love,
Deb
fairly tired mother of an eight year old boy :)
