That is wonderful! Today was my first day and it was great. I hope I 
can see the results of the poll soon.

&gt; Hi Maria,
&gt; 
&gt; I've created a poll to help you get the best possible
&gt; answer to your question.
&gt; 
&gt; See:
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Please keep two things in mind:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) no one except for me (and Justin) has been on this
&gt; diet for very long. 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) I think only answers from people who have been on
&gt; the diet for at least 3 weeks are meaningful, so
&gt; that's how I framed the question. But that's not a lot
&gt; of people at the moment.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) the poll will never close, so people can change
&gt; their answers as they progress/fail miserably. This
&gt; means the poll will get more and more informative as
&gt; people try the diet.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep in mind that internet polling is hugely
&gt; inaccurate and subject to abuse. But I'm not aware
&gt; that anyone else is doing anything better.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck!
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard

&gt; &gt; Hello
&gt; &gt; I accidently found the no s diet website and found
&gt; &gt; it very 
&gt; &gt; interesting. I talked to my mom about it and she
&gt; &gt; and I decided to 
&gt; &gt; try it. My downfall is chocolate and I figured this
&gt; &gt; diet will help 
&gt; &gt; me. I have been trying the weightwatchers diet on
&gt; &gt; my own with some 
&gt; &gt; success but I am tired of counting all the &quot;points&quot;
&gt; &gt; all the time. I 
&gt; &gt; probably sounded dumb when I would comment outloud
&gt; &gt; how many points I 
&gt; &gt; was eating. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I just wanted to ask from you guys if you could tell
&gt; &gt; me how many 
&gt; &gt; weeks you have been on this diet and how many pounds
&gt; &gt; you have lost? 
&gt; &gt; Thank You,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Maria
