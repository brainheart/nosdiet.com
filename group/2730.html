&gt; HI deb, this sounds so good,will defintely try it. I make one 
similar called Eden salad it is with fresh spinch,chopped red 
cabbage,romaine and green leaf(or any combo you like) with mandarin 
oranges,chopped pecans,feta cheese, and chicken or shrimp. I use a 
raspberry vinagrette and olive oil dressing(mix according to taste)I 
copied it from an Amish restaurant in Sarasota.it is my fave ! I 
think the four smaller meals is fine.No rules against that and if it 
keeps you from bingeing later yeah !!! I personally save time one 
salads by buying it prewashed ready to eat. I am more apt to eat 
salad if its easy to make.For busy MOm like so many of on on NOS, 
quick and easy is the key to eating healthy for our families.Let us 
know how it goes with the 4 small meals. Jools
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a great salad to try out :)
&gt; 
&gt; Mix Romaine lettuce, mesclun mixed greens, grape tomatoes, 
cucumber, 
&gt; shredded red cabbage, some carrots, and two tablspoons of red 
kidney 
&gt; beans (for protein) Garnish with 2 teaspoons of raisins and slices 

&gt; of 4 or 5 fresh strawberries :)
&gt; 
&gt; Deb's dressing (Newman move yer'ass over!)
&gt; Juice of one orange, half teaspoon of lime juice, two sesame oil, 

&gt; two splashes of rice wine vinegar, splash of balsamic vinegar, 
half 
&gt; teaspoon of mustard, two teaspoons of mayonaise, some salt and 
&gt; pepper to taste.
&gt; 
&gt; This salad is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the tastebuds, 
with 
&gt; it's lively mix of red and green colors and sweet and tangy 
tastes...
&gt; 
&gt; For the last two weeks or so, I have noticed that I have almost no 

&gt; appetite in the mornings, and we usually eat dinner between 5 and 

&gt; 6:30.... Rather than go back for various snacks after dinner, I 
have 
&gt; decided that I will be changing my three meals to 4... My 
breakfast 
&gt; is usually pretty small, and I don't think that's going to change 

&gt; soon... It's really hard when I'm trying to be quick and get 
dinner 
&gt; ready for my son and me to take the time to prepare a really great 

&gt; salad... I will try to do this in advance if I can think ahead, 
but 
&gt; for now, I consider this salad as my version of &quot;dessert&quot;... And 

&gt; though it breaks with the 3 plate rule, it still is healthful 
stuff 
&gt; and *not* Ben and Jerry's! Sometimes I don't feel like I need 
this 
&gt; but lately I have, so this is going to be an experiment for me in 

&gt; bending one of the NoS rules... I can't decide whether to consider 

&gt; this a meal unto itself, or just a second course in an extended 
&gt; dinner... No matter what, it still beats endless trips to the 
fridge 
&gt; once dinner is done, into the wee wee hours...
&gt; Hey Richard is playing guitar and singing for me now, a first 
class 
&gt; serenade! Guess what he's playing folks... Well one quick hint, 
his 
&gt; mother is a Deadhead, so for tonight it's &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot; by 

&gt; the Grateful Dead! What a little chip of the oldish block :)
&gt; Hope you are all having great weeks so far! :)
&gt; Love and Peace,
</pre>
