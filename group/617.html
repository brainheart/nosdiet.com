Hi Maxine,

It sounds like you've got a reasonable plan for
dealing with work food temptations. As for the Friday
screw up, shake it off. It's not like starting over.
It's one lousy mistake. The less you obsess over it,
the less important it is. Just keep at your otherwise
well established nosdiet routine. By not allowing
yourself to give in to self revenge, you'll funnel
that righteous energy into ordinary daily strictness
which is so much more important.

Best of luck,

Reinhard

&gt; Hi
&gt; Well today I did not do well. I was really stressed
&gt; out about a quiz I took yesterday and I dont think I
&gt; did well on. So today I cheated. And I feel so
&gt; bad about it. Its like starting over again. This
&gt; next week is my spring break from school and I also
&gt; took a week of my vacation off work. My goal is to
&gt; walk each day and get back in the swing of things. I
&gt; cant really not eat at work, because Im on a very
&gt; tight budget and at work the food is free. But
&gt; during the week I try to stick to salads and grilled
&gt; chicken. Fries are my favorite so I let myself have
&gt; them once a week. Now on the s diet it will be on
&gt; Saturday and just a small one. I just really need to
&gt; watch it. I might see my x husband in May at a
&gt; friends birthday party so Id like to be at least a
&gt; little lighter by then.

&gt; Hope this is a good sign? If not, pipe up.
&gt; 
&gt; I was kind of out of it myself because of my medical
&gt; lay up, so here's my attempt to catch up a bit:
&gt; 
&gt; Tom, I didn't get a chance to thank you for your
&gt; long
&gt; post Monday. You're right, the financial
&gt; implications
&gt; of the nosdiet are not insignificant! 
&gt; 
&gt; Hana, welcome. You're not the first person who's
&gt; come
&gt; to the nosdiet having done something basically
&gt; similar. I hope the simple mnemonics and this group
&gt; make it even easier to stick to.
&gt; 
&gt; Bonnie, that's an impressive haul, between you and
&gt; your husband. As far as I know, you're the first
&gt; husband and wife nos-dieters. May there be many
&gt; more!
&gt; 
&gt; Lee, I'm happy you seem to have found your stride. 3
&gt; weeks is my magic number, you know...
&gt; 
&gt; Maxine, it's got to be extra tough working in fast
&gt; food -- you have my extra sympathy. If food on the
&gt; job
&gt; is a real danger, you might want to write it off
&gt; entirely (not sure how feasible this is). As for
&gt; time
&gt; constraints (you mention you're a student too), at
&gt; least the nosdiet is time efficient. But exercise,
&gt; as
&gt; you mention, is going to be tricky. I'd recommend
&gt; trying to squeeze in *something* regularly, however
&gt; modest. I can't do shovelglove for the next three
&gt; weeks while I recuperate from surgery, but I'll make
&gt; sure to devote that 14 minute daily block to some
&gt; form
&gt; of exercise every day. I think carving out the time
&gt; is
&gt; the crucial step, and not carving out more than you
&gt; can stick with is the key to doing that
&gt; successfully.
&gt; 
&gt; Best of luck to all,
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard
