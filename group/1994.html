&gt;I am very happy to report an apparent 2 pound loss! The number on 
the scale had not gone down for many months (years?), so I am 
inclined to believe it, especially because I've been feeling my 
clothes are looser. Two pounds wouldn't have excited me in the old 
days, when dieting and weight loss was easier and quicker, but now I 
will be happy for any OUNCE that goes away and stays away. =)
So I am happy, I am re-committed, and I am looking forward to next 
month. 

...That is terrific news Diane!
Super Sheats! Away!
I bet you feel like a million bucks :)
Try the measuring approach Diane...There is no room for guessing 
there...Your above statement is one of almost, disbelief (you know 
me and my over analyzing ways) &quot;apparent 2 lbs&quot; &quot;inclined to believe 

it&quot;
With the scale it's more of a gamble whether or not you lost, it's 
water, it's a crappy scale etc....
You can't argue with a tapemeasure, and as long as you 
don't &quot;squeeze&quot; any extra inches out of yourself, when measuring, 

and try to measure in the same location each time...I like to do at 
the top of the hipbones, ie the waist, and the wide area which spans 
the miles across my bellybutton. I try not to cheat, because what's 
the point of fooling myself? I don't measure through clothing, right 
on the skin...
Scale or measuring tape,
Congratulations no matter what! You are on your way :)
Love,
Deb
