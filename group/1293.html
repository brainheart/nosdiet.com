Hi Lee, it's Debbie here...I think that you could tweak the system if 
you call the hurricaine a &quot;Storm&quot; that starts with S!
Don't focus on the mistakes you make in the process. As I said to 
someone a few days ago:
Setbacks are for people who are going somewhere..if you weren't on 
the road to a successful life, you would never even think of yourself 
as &quot;falling off&quot; the path to begin with, because you wouldn't have a 

goal in mind...Keep your eyes on the prize
Welcome that setback and embrace it!
It means that you are going somewhere, not just settling to stay the 
same. It is not easy, I know that very well..I don't know how 
overweight you are, or what your background is, but we are all in 
this group for similar reasons..Incase you were wondering. I am 210 
lbs now (after my first loss of 5!) so I can relate to wanting to get 
thinner. And guess what, 3 years ago I was around 165. I didn't 
maintain the loss, because I didn't adopt a lifestyle change and when 
the stress hit me big time this winter, I got really depressed sat on 
my buns, and ate non-stop...I feel so much more in control just 
having to make some small modifications to my eating and thinking 
with Reinhards great suggestions, and I really feel that I will be 
able to keep this going for life because it is just about not 
overeating and I can still enjoy those high calorie foods once or 
twice a week. 
It takes a Herculean effort to keep your mind positive, but that will 
make the difference. Most people gain weight when they are sad, 
lonely or stressed...
Be a friend to yourself and congratulate yourself for every small 
achievement...Including the setbacks.
That should pull you through some rough patches :) 
PS Hurricaines are very stress producing, maybe you were just afraid 
and looking for comfort in a candybar.
Be well,
Love
Debbie
