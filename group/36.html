My guess is if you can stick to the diet out of school
you'll be able to resist the temptation of all
nighters when you get back. But this is based on
nothing.

You've got about a month, right? That's enough to
build a habit. And habit, as you probably know from
being on the receiving end of bad ones, is a powerful
force.

My advice is to be ridiculously strict the first few
weeks, to build that habit. Don't worry about whether
school will mess things up. When it comes, if you've
been resolute, you'll be in a much better position to
deal with it.

Good luck! And let us know how it goes.

&gt; I'm glad today is Saturday. Good day to start this
&gt; diet. :)
&gt; 
&gt; I know we'll going to struggle as soon as we're back
&gt; at school, but 
&gt; hopefully by then we'll be well on our way to
&gt; forming healthy habits.
