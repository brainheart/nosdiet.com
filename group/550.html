Hi everyone - i stumbled across this website on an aim page of the 
day site... it looks like a good idea but i have learned to be 
skeptical. Can you all tell me what your experiences are with 
this &quot;plan&quot;. I have been on almost every diet you can think of - 

Atkins, south beach, La weight loss, etc. ...i've wasted alot of 
money and i want to find something that actually works. It kind of 
all started when i went on the atkins Diet, then i was 135 and was 
really depressed because i couldn't fit my sixes anymore ...Ha! i 
wish i had the same problem now ... I lost the ten pounds on atkins 
and was back down to 125, but i was one of those diet book readers 
who goes straight to the what-to-do part of the book and doesn't 
read between the lines and never reads the entire book (i have since 
learned my lesson). I went straight back to cereal for breakfast-
sandwhich for lunch eating and gained about 15 pounds very 
fast...yikes! I wont go into detail about all the diets in between 
then and now but i will tell you that i am 155 (no one ever guesses 
that so some of it must be muscle) and 5'6&quot; size 8 or 9 ..i do also 

work out everyday....but i really feel more comfortable at say -
compromising- a size 7... I could really use some advice. Thanks - 
Leean
