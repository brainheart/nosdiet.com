I was wondering the other day: what would our lives be like if nobody had 

ever invented the bathroom scale? Imagine it for a few moments...a great 

wide world full of interesting things, and not a single scale in anyone's 

home. Mmmm, that's a nice feeling!

Now ask yourself why you should allow such an item in your home. It usually 

(not always, of course) contributes to obsession, compulsiveness, 
unrealistic expectations, discouragement, depression, and WEIGHT GAIN, just 

for starters. I can't think of many positive results from a owning a scale. 

If scales did not exist, we would have to find other ways of evaluating our 

bodies...or just stop evaluating! If only doctors were allowed to have 

scales, we would find out our weight &quot;by prescription&quot; once a year at a 

physical, and I bet that number wouldn't seem half so important!

I'm too tired to give this ramble the brainpower I normally would, but I 

just wanted to share this thought since it never occurred to me in exactly 

this way before. What's silly is that although I don't like that &quot;Imagine&quot; 

song sung by...John Lennon(?)...I can't help humming, &quot;Imagine there's no 

sca-ales...it's easy if you try...&quot; (Someone else can finish the words to 

this new version!)

Diane in Florida, somewhat affected by hurricanes lately (but only by having 

to work harder than usual!)
