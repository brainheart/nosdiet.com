Hi Saleta,

I'm sorry you're having a hard time. All 3 esses are
problems? That's tough... Is there a trigger failure,
something that's tough to resist and then once you've
succumbed to it you feel you might as well just fail
whole hog? Try to put your finger on what exactly it
is that's messing you up. My guess is there are a
small number of danger points which appetite is using
to break through. If you can identify these and
fortify yourself against them, it might be more
effective than simply trying to toughen up along the
line. Another important thing to do is think about
limit the penetration once there's a breakthrough. The
correct response to failure is not &quot;I messed up and am
worthless and will therefore just go ahead an eat some
more until I hit rock bottom&quot; but &quot;Woah! I messed up.
Stop. That was bad. But to continue would be much
worse. Now forget about it and move on.&quot; I think how
one handles the initial mess-up is the most important
point in any form of self discipline. One has to care
enough to be strict, but not vengeful, or desperate.
It's a tricky balance.

At least you've got 'S'odas down -- that's not
nothing.

As for energy supplements, I don't know anything about
them. I have to admit I'm suspicious of them. There's
just too much profit motive and too little regulation,
and it's just terrible psychology besides. Can you get
out for a walk some time in the afternoon, on your
lunch break maybe? I'm amazed at what it does for my
spirits (and body, for that matter). I doubt there's
any pill to match it, if you can make the time. 

Good luck, hope this helps,

Reinhard

&gt; been doing so 
&gt; well. Snacking, seconds, sweets. IT's frustrating! I
&gt; do well for a 
&gt; few days and then I fall. On a much lighter note I
&gt; have kicked the 
&gt; soda addiction! That S is licked! I'm also still not
&gt; finding the 
&gt; time to exercise. I am very busy and when I do have
&gt; 2 seconds to 
&gt; myself I fall asleep because it's the end of the day
&gt; and I am 
&gt; exhusted! 
&gt; Does anyone know how I can find and energy boosting
&gt; suppliment that 
&gt; doesn't have ephdra in it? I need an edge and I feel
&gt; like i'm 
&gt; dragging the second part of the day. Any
&gt; suggestions?
