I have to chime in on the Bowflex thing--it's a $2000
coathanger. You can buy a basic set of weights for
$150, or a sledgehammer for $20. Of course, those
things are less user friendly, but you can buy a book
on weight training technique for $20 or so, and then
you're set. Or the Shovelglove site... which is free.

If anyone has any questions about setting up a home
gym, let me know. I have a pretty nice one, and I can
help steer you away from some mistakes I've made, and
towards some of the smart purchases I've made. 

Anyway, congrats on your progress, Teresa. You'll hit
a &quot;tipping point&quot; and the scale weight will start to
drop eventually. It's inevitable. But for now, enjoy
the new muscle!

&gt; Are you exercising?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, Dan, six days a week. I try to couple jogging
&gt; with my Bowflex every other day and aerobics in my
&gt; living room the other days. It's getting cold here
&gt; so I won't get out as much.
&gt; 
&gt; ie. Bowflex--anyone considering buying this or any
&gt; other overpriced exercise torture chamber, please
&gt; think long and hard. I feel like an idiot for
&gt; buying a $1000 shovel glove. I guess it's been
&gt; worth it because my severe back and hip problems
&gt; have disappeared since using it, but I wonder if the
&gt; shovel glove would have had the same results.

&gt; Teresa, 
&gt; 
&gt; Frequently, as you &quot;tone up&quot;
&gt; muscle replaces fat, and since muscle is more
&gt; dense
&gt; than fat, you lose size, but not weight. This
&gt; means
&gt; that your jeans will fit better. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you're not exercising, you should start ;)

&gt; &gt; I agree with Dan. Forty pounds is too much to
&gt; lose
&gt; &gt; by Feb. Instead concentrate on how the clothes
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; your closet are fitting. I can now wear nearly
&gt; &gt; every pair of jeans I own, but I haven't lost
&gt; much
&gt; &gt; actual weight. Who cares!!!!!!! My sister is
&gt; trying
&gt; &gt; to lose for a class reunion next May and I am
&gt; trying
&gt; &gt; to encourage her. I've told her about the no s
&gt; diet
&gt; &gt; but she isn't overly interested.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My concern is getting ready for upcoming
&gt; holidays
&gt; &gt; too. I am hosting Thanksgiving and love to have
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; kinds of goodies here for guests. only problem
&gt; is,
&gt; &gt; if it's here I will eat it. For now I'm trying
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; do extra good because who's kidding who. I'm
&gt; gonna
&gt; &gt; eat.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Finally had someone at church mention that I'd
&gt; lost
&gt; &gt; weight. I could've kissed them but since I have
&gt; &gt; this strict moral code against kissing another
&gt; &gt; woman's husband, I refrained. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hang in there, everyone. I like the notion of
&gt; being
&gt; &gt; accountable to others. This diet does work even
&gt; tho
&gt; &gt; I haven't been adhering to it as well as I
&gt; could.
