&gt; HI Sharon, Glad to hear from you and that you are happy with this 

way of living. Thats wonderful! For some people it just clicks, i 
think part of the reason is why they are doing it. You &quot; want to be 

a thin person with good habits&quot;. That is so much bettter than saying 

i want to lose 15# or 50#. Its a life style goal and a healthy 
attitude. Not wanting it instantly shows adult mentality instead of 
the child attitude&quot; but I want it now !!!&quot; I have days of both 

personally to be honest. Mainly because i know what it feeels like 
to be &quot;thin&quot;. But i have never really had good habits formed until 

now. Its a wonderful feeling isn't it, knowing you are in full 
control and you even give yourself permission to take it easy and 
still you choose to not indulge.Woo hoo ! You inspired me you 
newbie! Updates from everyone really do help, so i am so glad you 
posted. 

Peace and blessings to you &amp; your family

Julie 

&gt; 
&gt; but I just wanted to check in to say that this way of living is 
&gt; really living! I weathered my first crisis-- a death in the 
family --&gt; I haven't posted much and I haven't posted in about a 
week or two, 

&gt; and, although I wanted to designate some days as &quot;special&quot;, I 

&gt; wasn't tempted to eat much at all. There was just no going 
&gt; overboard, even though I sort of gave myself permission to. 
&gt; 
&gt; This involves very little will power for me, since my purpose is 
not 
&gt; primarily to lose weight, but to become a thin person,with good 
&gt; habits, who doesn't feel deprived on the diet seesaw, for the rest 

&gt; of my life. I am not weighing yet -- I'll wait until I really feel 

&gt; like there has been a big difference, which I am already starting 

to 
&gt; see. I find that when I want to look thinner the next morning, I 
&gt; just have a lighter dinner and/or exercise more. I crave healthy 
&gt; meals because I want to feel good. This is so great!!
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to get off my chest the fact that I sort of had seconds 
&gt; tonight, although I started with a tiny portion of lean meat that 

&gt; was doled out to me, so my plate wasn't at all full, and it wasn't 

a 
&gt; portion I would have normally chosen to put on my plate. So I had 

a 
&gt; couple of small brisket pieces more. Now you know I'm not 
perfect....
&gt; 
&gt; Have a great weekend, everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; Sheila
