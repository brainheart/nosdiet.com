Hi Deb,



Thanks for the advice. Yes, thank goodness for being able to have the things
we crave on S days. I know I will be more selective with my treats on those
days. The trick is not going overboard. 

I have realized over the course of a couple of years that there is no such
thing as quick results. I only lost 10lbs last year and 10lbs. the year
before that. That was mostly from incorporating exercise into my life. 
The
pounds haven't come back, thank goodness. I guess because they were slow 
and
steady. I didn't start really working on my diet until this year. That 
is
why I have achieve the weight loss I've had so far. My weight has plateaued
several times this year. I was looking for something that could spark my
weight loss again. There are 12 weeks until the end of the year. Hopefully
I can get a little closer to my goal weight. 

What kind of success have you had with the No S diet? How long have you 
been
on it?



Take Care,

Lissa

Hi Lissa :) Ah Chocolate...Food of the Gods in the Aztec culture
Who doesn't like it? :) Fortunately for all of us we are still 
allowed to enjoy this indulgent dessert, on S days.
As far as worrying about that 3 meal thing, it's really the first 
week or two which is the biggest adjustment, and there is a little 
loophole built into the plan for those people who absolutely must 
have more meals...If you need your afternoon &quot;snack&quot;, call it a meal 

instead, keep it small and don't vary the number of meals per 
day...In otherwords, don't snack &quot;unconsciously&quot; whenever something 

presents itself, make yourself really wait for a meal...this 
eliminates &quot;autopilot noshing&quot; and curbs calories over the whole 
day.
It does make you focus on making your meals substantial and 
fullfilling as well as (hopefully) healthy...
If you have already lost 15 or 20 lbs that is great, but don't be 
surprised if you may &quot;level off&quot; for a while...plateus do happen and 

it is commonly believed that if a person loses 25 lbs or so over the 
course of a year, this is considered a healthy &quot;Keep it off For 
Good&quot; rate...I will be the first to salute you if you can lose more 

this year, but don't immediately put the &quot;quick loss&quot; psychology to 

work by putting pressure on yourself to lose so much so fast...I 
have been there before numerous times...Yes psych yourself up, but 
if I may, this diet is much more geared towards &quot;pain free&quot; loss 

which is slower, and more maintainable...and life friendly...
Good luck! 
Peace,
Deb
