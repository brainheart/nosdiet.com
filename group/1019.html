---hi kimi
i gained my weight when i was 16 because i stopped running around and 
being a tom boy and started sitting home and snacking . the more i 
thought about losing weight the more i ate.. til i was 145
then i started college and ate more junk i used to buy like six 
donuts instead of one so people wouldnt think i was buying my self a 
donut. how silly is that. and then eat six.. it was awful
i ended up at about 160 my first year at college and 195 by the time 
i graduated ..i have spent my entire rest of my life on a diet trying 
to lose the weight.. and never being able to enjoy eating without 
feeling guilty or saying no i cant eat that.....and being a party 
pooper around my friends.. so maybe on this diet..i can eat with my 
friends and still lose weight.. i find i am NOT hungry on this diet.. 
just have to break the shoving food in your mouth habit and plan for 
a meal .. knowing i can pretty much eat what i want( excluding sugar) 
is a new experience for me . i do find i am making fairly healthy 
choices i think i will respond well to finally being free of all the 
guilt 
but if you can do this diet and develop healthy habits of not 
snacking and not eating sugar or artificial sweetners and not eating 
seconds you will be well on your way
