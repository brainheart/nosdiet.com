how i envy tall and lean people...i have a brother who is just like this... eats what 
ever he wants and still be lean and tall... he s got the same parents as i do and yet 
he s got a totally different set of genes.!!!.. still i have to admit that eventhough 
he binges most of the days , he tends to &quot;forget&quot; to eat on some days.. i 
could be sitting with him at 2 am or so and then he d suddenly remember , he s just 
had an orange juice for the day... if that was me remembering such precious 
information (but let s get real, how could i forget in the first place???) , my 
reaction would be stuff my face and eat anything right on the spot.. his is usually 
go to sleep empty -stomached and just say &quot; ok , i ll eat tomorrow&quot;.............!
so it s not only his genes that are different from mine , but also his mental 
attitude towards food (forget to eat??? come on!) 
mmm, so my weakness isnt sugar.. it s bread and cheeze... i could live for days on 
just this menu... and u only have to deprive of one of them for 1 day to see how 
cranky i can get.. (but then, so does driving , studying and many other 
make-dee-cranky-activities)...!
and karen.. U GAVE UP SMOKING.......! that s no easy task, i imagine losing weight 
and maintaining healthy eating habits is like 1/1,000,000 of the &quot;giving up 
smoking challenge&quot;... think like this, how cranky were u when u were nicotine- 
deprived??? yet u did it....
ok, some last advice from a relatively new (2 weeks) nosdieter.. (i am not sure 
whether Reinhard will approve of these, but that s how i was &quot;sneakly&quot; 
handling my nosdiet..)
1 ) related to the s- days , i make it a point to have two s- days per weak.. and 
they dont necessarily begin with an S
2) whenever i think about food in non-meals time, i drink water instead... it makes 
my somach bloat and just makes me spend the rest of my &quot;hungry time&quot; to and 
from the bathroom
3) i ve set my number of meals at 4.. (cant do a 3 meals per day).. i dont have set 
times for each meal, i can even have the four of them in a 4 hour period.. but once i 
am thru with the four of them, then no more food for me.. i know that s quite 
unhealthy, but i ve been grazing for far too long to set defenite meal times.. at 
least i have defenite number of meals.. i call that an improvement.. and if on the 
long run all i could manage is &quot;teach my body&quot; to have 4 meals per day then 
that s great... it s up to me to distribute the meals so that i dont feel hungry for 
say 12 hours of the day...!
4) and to shovel glove, it s not that difficult really.. as long as u dont bend ur 
back too much the wrong way.. and no pro with the 14 mins.. they re not even long 
enough to make u gasp for air.. use lighter sledgehammer... forget the 8pounder - use 
any lighter sledge- like thing... mmm.. i like the shovelling movement VERY much.. 
personally i am quite lazy at getting started but once i do, i enjoy it so much and 
feel all enrgetic and &quot;super womanly&quot; that i actually feel disappointed 
when the timer goeas off.... so the key word is :GET STARTED and the rest will 
follow
5) i do SG 3 times a week only (tops).. and if by friday i dont have three days SG i 
have an intense course on fri. sat and sun.... i dont mind exercising on the 
weekend
6) and related to the timing.. no morning for me at all.. i am not one of the feel 
-very- good- in -the -morning people so i just do it at about 9 pm or sometimes as 
late as 12 am.. (i sleep extemely late.... which partially account for why i am not a 
morning - person)
well. karen that about all my trial and errors in nosdiet so far.. just dont want to 
feel obligated to do things by the book (in this case by the site.. he hehe).. and if 
u bend the rules a little (i am sure Reinahrd wont mind) .. dont feel bad, other 
people do too (i am one.. sure there are plenty more) and still see results...
and before i go everyone.. i lost 3-4 lbs (cause the scales cant make up its mind he 
he he) yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! down to 160 lbs (or 159 lbs.. or whatever.. the needle 
on the scales has gone in the direction i like.. dont mind how much )
love everyone

Hi all! I can't tell you how much all of your stories and words have 
inspired me. Yet I feel so cranky. I hate thinking about food all 
day long. I hate that I can't control it. I feel like I have PMS. 
Sugar is worse than heroin. Vent Vent Vent.
My husband is a basketball coach and personal trainer. Needless to 
say, he is in great shape. Partly because of his job but mostly due 
to genetics. My son has definately inheriated his body type, They 
are both tall, slender and lean. Not to mention they can eat 
anything they want and not gain a pound. Then theres me. I look like 
the odd man out.
Yet I am more determined and optimistic than ever. I quit smoking 3 
years ago. Hardest thing I have EVER done. Including labor. But I 
did it. I am addicted to sugar. I must also break this habbit. Today 
is a tad easier than yesterday. But not much.
Karen
P.S. not tackling the exercise yet. Afraid to know how out of shape 
I am.
