Keep it going Mac, I'm doing this for several months now, (I can't remember exactly) 
and shed quite a few pounds. I've never felt so balanced and comfortable and 
confident with food. This is more than a diet, its a way of eating. Last night I had 
some icecream, the first time I've had anything sweet in weeks. I could have a small 
portion, enjoy it, and leave it. No guilt, no nausea.

Thank you Reinhard for creating this.

Brian

Good luck, Mac, and let us know how it goes. 75 pounds
would look very nice on our poll :-).

If evening snacks are going to be trouble, try pushing
back your dinners, or at least keep in mind that you
have that option in your arsenal.

&gt; I stumbled across the noSdiet web site 4 days ago
&gt; when I was looking 
&gt; for a graphic. I had just returned from my yearly
&gt; check up at my 
&gt; doctors office where I had to &quot;weighed in&quot;. I have
&gt; never been 
&gt; successful with dieting but I figure what do I have
&gt; to lose. The 
&gt; concept of the noSdiet makes too much sense. I am
&gt; working on day 3 
&gt; and haven't had any problems with sticking to the
&gt; plan. The biggest 
&gt; change for me is no snacking, especially in the
&gt; evenings. I trying 
&gt; to keep more active and have increased my activity
&gt; level over the 
&gt; past 3 weeks. I am determined to lose 75 lb. and
&gt; change my lifestyle 
&gt; so I can maintain a healthy weight. 
&gt; Thank you for running the web site, I truly believe
&gt; that I can 
&gt; succeed following the simple plan of the noSdiet.
