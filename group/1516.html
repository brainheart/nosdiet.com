&gt; We're rooting for you. Bug us incessantly with
&gt; updates. Whatever happens, I promise you, we're not
&gt; going to get tired of hearing about it.

Okay Reinhard, I'll take your word for it...

&gt; I've come up with little systems for some of the other
&gt; problems you mentioned, though I'm not sure they're
&gt; No-s caliber:

I read your Everyday Systems page, and read some of the emails from 
the Everyday Systems group. I think I must be the most poorly 
disciplined person ever...

When I first found NoS, about a month and a half ago, I was so gung-
ho. The first three weeks, I messed up (small slips) one day out of 
each week. Then the slips started getting bigger and bigger and 
eventually grew into a full-fledged binge. Now I just cannot seem to 
get back on track. Just getting from breakfast to lunch, and lunch 
to dinner without a screw-up is starting to feel way out of reach.

I need to come up with some way to get from one meal to the next 
without breaking the rules. 

I can't undo what I've already done today, but I don't have to 
succumb to the diet mentality that says, &quot;well, I've already messed 

up, so screw the rest of the day -- I'll start over tomorrow.&quot;

No. My goal is to get through the rest of this day without breaking 
the rules.

I see NoS as my only realistic hope for breaking a life-long food 
dependency (I'm 36). I've been to Overeaters Anonymous, Weight 
Watchers, many other diet programs. I don't want to go that route 
anymore. 

I know that if I could just get one clean week under my belt, I'd be 
well on my way...hell, if I can just get one clean DAY under my belt, 
I'd be well on my way ...

Okay. So I have to think about the rest of today. I think I'll be 
okay until I get home. When I get home, I'll eat dinner. Getting 
from dinner to bedtime without eating will be a problem if I don't 
come up with a strategy ahead of time.

But even when I DO come up with a strategy ahead of time, sometimes I 
just say f*ck it, I don't care...and I eat anyway. But I DO care.

All right...enough whining for now.

Valerie
