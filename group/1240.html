Valarie,

You just got off course for a brief moment. Let's go ahead get 
back on track. You can do it. Dig as deep as you can. And remember 
continue to bug us as often as you you need to. We are all in this 
thing together. Good luck! Be strong!!!!!

&gt; Hi Valerie
&gt; 
&gt; Did you notice the fact that you have a success to your credit? You
&gt; mentioned that you don't usually post to groups that you belong to 

so this
&gt; is a change to your normal pattern of behaviour, one that you 
thought would
&gt; be helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you can do it once, then you can do it again :-)
&gt; 
&gt; So often we do not give ourselves credit for our achievements and 
we
&gt; concentrate instead on where we went wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; (By the way, I hope the results were helpful!)
&gt; 
&gt; With all good wishes
&gt;

&gt; Subject: [nosdiet] Having a hard time
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Good afternoon everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm on my second week of NoS, and I am starting to have a hard 

time. For
&gt; &gt; whatever reason (could it have been that job interview I had 
this
&gt; morning?),
&gt; &gt; I just let go of all restraint last night and broke all three noS 

rules.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Today has been okay so far, but I feel pretty shaky. I don't 

want to give
&gt; &gt; up on this and have it become just one of many failed attempts to 

change.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I usually don't post to any of the groups I have membership in, 

but I felt
&gt; &gt; that if I let others in this group know what's going on, it might 

help me
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; stay on track.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Valerie
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
