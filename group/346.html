&gt; I hope that clears things up.

Okay, my understanding is getting clearer.... *but* I want to focus 
on the key word you used above- SOMEWHAT. What I take from your 
discussion is that doing the shoveling maneuver with the shovelglove 
device does not completely replace floor exercises (bicycles, reverse 
crunches, etc.) when it comes to really working and highlighting the 
defined abs. Once bodyfat is low enough to show the ab muscles, 
assuming you have done the shovel work religiously while working off 
the fat, the abs that are finally revealed will not be as defined as 
they would be had you done floor movements instead/in addition. Is 
this right?

I guess what I'm concerned about is when the day comes that I am 
below 12% bodyfat, I want my abs to be ready. So while I wait for 
that day, I want to be doing what is going to get me the best 
results. I have been using the shovelglove, but to the neglect of the 
floor movements, and I hope that I am doing enough. I hate to think I 
could have been doing more in all those weeks.

Bottom line- If I stick to the plan, and do *only* Nosdiet, 
shovelglove, and urban ranger, and do them religiously, do you think 
I'll be pleased with my abs when I'm done?
