Hi,
Thanks for the welcome and the rules. I'll be sure to check out the 
website. I know it will be tricky for me to start but I'll get the hang out it. 

:o) Oh, on the snacks, would that be any food in between meals? Would I need 

to stick to 5 or 6 meals throughout the day? Also, I'm a coffee drinker and 

sometimes tea. Is splenda or Equal allowed?

Hey, welcome aboard. The rules are simple... no snacks, no sweets, no
seconds, except on S-days. www.nosdiet.com has more details... but in
general:
Sweets - anything that is primarily sugar. For instance, a can of
Coke would be a &quot;Sweet&quot;, but a piece of fruit would not be.
Snacks - gratuitous food between meals.
Seconds - Well, tihs one is pretty obvious.

S-days - special days, or days starting with &quot;S&quot;. So basicallyl, 
the
weekend and special occasions. The definition of &quot;Special occasion&quot;
is left as an exercise to the reader, but most of us consider things
like holidays, birthdays, etc. So on S-days, you can pretty much do
what you want and not feel guilty, thanks to the Law of Averages... if
you're &quot;good&quot; for 5 days and &quot;bad&quot; for only 2, you will make 
progress.

I found the no Seconds was the best &quot;Bang for the buck&quot; so to speak. 

It takes some practice to learn how much food you really can eat in a
meal, but it really does make a difference. Now, even at a Chinese
buffet, I can stick to one plate and feel like it was an enjoyable meal.

As for getting started... I started on a Monday during the beginning
of a two-day road trip. That made the transition a little eaiser...
usually I don't eat much while travelling, so I was able to get the
first two days under my belt pretty easily. Some people will start on
a Friday for similar reasons - if the weekend is right around the
corner, it makes it easier to make it through the day.

Another important thing (also mentioned on the website) is not to
punish yourself too hard when you mess up (as we all have). Just say,
&quot;Crud, I messed up&quot;, get back on track, and try not to do it 
again.

Your attitide of &quot;Taking it one day at a time&quot; is perfect for 
No-S.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I joined a few weeks ago but haven't had time to go through all the
posts. 
&gt; I've been trying to loose weight for several years only to have it 

come back 
&gt; again. Right now I am fighting hypertension and borderline 
diabetes. I 
&gt; could stand to lose about 80 pounds or more. Where do I start? I
don't have a 
&gt; problem working out. But, what are the rules for no &quot;S&quot; diet? 
Is
it all 
&gt; sugar? If so, what do I substitute? Also, aren't there cheat
days? ;o) 
&gt; Thanks for letting me join and sorry for lurking.
&gt; Nancy
