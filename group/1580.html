I have type 2 diabetes and use small amounts of fructose.I buy it in
granulated crystal form and use small mounts for sweetening.I am careful 
not
to use much.A small box lasts me months.All the soft drinks I use are
artificially sweetened I drink unsweetened tea and fruit teas. I monitor 
my
blood sugar frequently and keep it tight. I am also losing weight. I
exercise regularly. Doing Pilates and visiting the gym. My doctor keeps 
a
watch on my blood chemistry, which is good.I don't think we have the soft
drinks you write about here in England. We have the big brand colas, but 
I
never have them. I just didn't like the taste. A small amount of fructose
won't hurt, but it does have Calories, weight for weight about the same 
as
sucrose, but it's sweeter. If they're adding loads of fructose to drinks 
in
the US,and calling them &quot;sugar free&quot;, that's unfair. One useful tip is 
to
remember that any chemical name ending in &quot;-ose&quot; is a sugar or a 
sugar
polymer like cellulose

Subject: [nosdiet] Soft Drinks (Dr. Williams Newsletter)


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I know we don't discuss health and food issues much on this list (because
&gt; that's the OLD diet mentality), but in light of recent posts about 
the
evils
&gt; of soft drinks, I think some of you would find this newsletter
interesting.
&gt; There's a good explanation of why the high-fructose corn syrup in 
soft
&gt; drinks could be a major cause of our current obesity epidemic.

&gt; Blood Sugar Rising
&gt; Generation XL
&gt; How Sweet It Isn't
&gt; A Small Spoonful of Cinnamon Helps the Glucose Go Down
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Blood Sugar Rising
&gt;
&gt; Dear Reader,
&gt;
&gt; In just the last ten years the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased
&gt; 40 percent; it now affects 17 to 20 million people in the US (half of 
whom
&gt; are walking, or maybe stumbling, around undiagnosed). Another 2,000 
people
&gt; are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes each day in this country. As I've
&gt; discussed before, type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes,
&gt; but that term was dropped since type 2 is now being found in children.
&gt;
&gt; It has already been estimated that of the children born in the year 
2000,
&gt; 38.5 percent of the females and 32.8 percent of the males will be
diagnosed
&gt; with diabetes sometime in their life. (In the Hispanic population it 
is
even
&gt; worse. Estimates are that 52.3 percent of the females and 45.4 percent 
of
&gt; the males will develop the disease.) Worldwide cases of diabetes are
&gt; expected to double in the next 25 years. I suspect it will happen 
more
&gt; quickly than that.
&gt;
&gt; Generation XL
&gt;
&gt; Obesity and diabetes are going to be an especially serious problem in 
the
&gt; generation now developing. Children in this country have never been 
so
&gt; overweight. We had generation X, but now it looks like we have generation
XL
&gt; (extra-large). My heart goes out to these children who, because of 
their
&gt; diet, will undoubtedly suffer from diseases that were once only seen 
in
the
&gt; elderly.
&gt;
&gt; When it comes to weight loss, I'm not one to encourage counting calories,
&gt; but if you want to lose weight, it's as simple as this: You have to 
burn
&gt; more calories than you take in. You burn calories through activity.
&gt;
&gt; It's understandable that hard physical labor has fallen out of favor 
in
this
&gt; country, but to remain healthy, our bodies require some form of regular
&gt; exercise. If your job isn't extremely physical, and you don't regularly
&gt; participate in strenuous activities like gardening or home improvement,
then
&gt; exercise is your only option. Walking is great. It can be done anywhere
and
&gt; doesn't require any special equipment. Just keep in mind that it may 
take
a
&gt; few weeks to start to see the results, and it needs to be done on a 
very
&gt; regular basis. (If you need something to help gauge your progress, 
you
might
&gt; want to actually count your steps during each walk or purchase an
&gt; inexpensive pedometer. That would be one way to gradually increase 
the
&gt; distance you walk each day and not have to follow the same route.)
&gt;
&gt; How Sweet It Isn't
&gt;
&gt; Every time I write about diabetes, the topic of carbohydrates arises, 
and
&gt; the subject eventually gets around to fructose. Fructose, as you may 
know,
&gt; is a form of sugar that occurs naturally in fruit and honey, and has a 
low
&gt; glycemic index. Based on these characteristics, it has often been 
assumed
to
&gt; be a good substitute for sucrose, or white sugar. It's not.
&gt;
&gt; Fructose is becoming more prevalent in the American diet these days,
mostly
&gt; in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Undoubtedly, the major
&gt; source of HFCS is soft drinks, but it's hard to find any sweetened 
food
&gt; product that doesn't now contain HFCS. If you want to lose weight 
or
control
&gt; your weight, you need to walk away from HFCS products (yet another 
reason
&gt; walking is good for you).
&gt;
&gt; The problem with fructose is in the way your body responds to it. When 
you
&gt; consume other carbohydrates, your pancreas releases insulin. Insulin 
has
&gt; several functions:
&gt;
&gt; Once your digestive system has broken carbohydrates down into glucose 
and
&gt; other components, insulin transports that glucose from the bloodstream
into
&gt; your muscle cells so it can be used as fuel. Insulin also transports 
the
&gt; glucose into your liver so the energy can be stored for later use.
&gt;
&gt; Insulin begins to suppress your appetite by triggering signals that 
you're
&gt; satisfied and full.
&gt;
&gt; Insulin stimulates production of the hormone leptin. Leptin has been 
in
the
&gt; news lately as the latest fat fighter. Leptin is produced by your 
fat
cells,
&gt; and not only does it limit fat storage, but it also helps increase 
your
&gt; metabolic rate to burn excess fat.
&gt;
&gt; Fructose acts differently from other carbohydrates because it doesn't
&gt; trigger the release of insulin. As a result, fructose isn't moved 
to
muscle
&gt; cells for energy, leptin production isn't stimulated, and your metabolism
&gt; doesn't increase. Moreover, with fructose you never experience the
&gt; accompanying reduction in appetite or feeling that you're full.
&gt;
&gt; These facts have led many researchers to conclude that HFCS is the
&gt; underlying cause of the unprecedented obesity problem we're experiencing
&gt; today.
&gt;
&gt; A Small Spoonful of Cinnamon Helps the Glucose Go Down
&gt;
&gt; In the modern world, we're not as active as we could be, and our diets
&gt; aren't
&gt; as good as they could be, so nearly all of us can use some help with 
our
&gt; blood sugar. A very powerful tool that can help control blood sugar 
levels
&gt; is cinnamon. I've been recommending the routine use of cinnamon for 
years
&gt; now. It's one of the ingredients in my morning health shake. Recent
studies
&gt; have added so much support to this idea that you could now call cinnamon
&gt; &quot;the poor man's insulin.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; One gram (slightly less than a half-teaspoon) of cinnamon per day 
was
given
&gt; to 60 volunteers with type 2 diabetes. In just 40 days, this small 
amount
of
&gt; cinnamon reduced fasting glucose levels anywhere from 18 to 29 percent,
&gt; triglyceride levels 23 to 30 percent, LDL cholesterol levels 7 to 
27
&gt; percent, and total cholesterol 12 to 26 percent. No advantages or 
greater
&gt; improvements were found when larger doses were given. Also, when the
&gt; participants stopped taking the cinnamon, their blood sugar levels 
and
other
&gt; readings began to return to former levels. (J Agri Food Chem
04;52(1):65-70)
&gt; (Diabetes Care 03;26(12):3215-8)
&gt;
&gt; If you have diabetes or insulin resistance, or if you have a family
history
&gt; of the problem, or even if an honest look at your diet shows some
&gt; weaknesses, you would be smart to consider the benefits of adding 
1/2
&gt; teaspoon of cinnamon to your diet each day.
