Boy did I hit a wall! We had a friends wedding this weekend and I'm 
sure there was absolutely nothing Nos there to eat! Now I&quot;m 
Hispanic - anyone ever been to a Catholic Hispanic Wedding where the 
reception goes on for hours? I'm not even going to say what I ate! 
I tried to eat just a little and then I was dancing with my husband 
and some cousins and uncles of my friend I haven't seen in ages. 
Dancing is hard work - Especially on an almost empty stomach! It 
takes alot of energy. Energy I didn't seem to have because I felt 
faint from not eating. Not only that but my freinds mom kept coming 
to our table with food, food, food. What a nightmare. I kept 
thinking Wake up it's only a dream. I truely felt I wasn't in Kansas 
anymore TOTO! Well to say the least these last 3 days I look at food 
and my stomach turns - there was too much greasy food and my system 
took a beating. I learned my lesson. Next time I will sneak out and 
go grab a salad somewhere! Or better yet take my own that I know 
follows my Nos gudielines. Now I know it was the weekend but I do 
better with just a simple snack on the weekends not an oily feast! 
Here's a good tip: If you hear Rhumba or 
Salsa music: RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!
