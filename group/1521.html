 I always think it is so nice how you take the time to give advice and
encouragement. It is so appreciated.

How's the family?

Hi Valerie,

&gt; I know that if I could just get one clean week under
&gt; my belt, I'd be 
&gt; well on my way...hell, if I can just get one clean
&gt; DAY under my belt, 
&gt; I'd be well on my way ...

You're absolutely right to look at it this way. You
might not have much willpower and self-discipline now,
but every day you stick with it, every meal you stick
with it, you get stronger. Set your goals to the
nearest possible milestone so as not to feel
overwhelmed. Don't worry about years and months or
even weeks, that'll just make you despair. You have
the strength to make it to the next meal. Stay focused
on that and soon meals will become days, days weeks.
It's the people with the *least* willpower and self
discipline who benefit most from this system: because
they get some. Yes, it's hard. But there is no easy.
Hard makes easy. 

&gt; I need to come up with some way to get from one meal
&gt; to the next 
&gt; without breaking the rules. 
....
&gt;Getting 
&gt; from dinner to bedtime without eating will be a
&gt; problem if I don't 
&gt; come up with a strategy ahead of time.
&gt; 

As for strategy, here are the biggies, I think:

1) make your meals sufficiently large so you don't get
that hungry. If they're a little excessively large to
begin with, don't sweat it, that's much better than
the alternative.

2) Drink before you get hungry. Thirst is often
confused for hunger. People have posted a lot of
helpful finesses on this theme, have a look through
the archive.

&gt; But even when I DO come up with a strategy ahead of
&gt; time, sometimes I 
&gt; just say f*ck it, I don't care...and I eat anyway. 
&gt; But I DO care.

Do what Lee did: post to the group every day while
you're struggling. You'll care more if you know there
are a few hundred people reading about it. Your
private little slip ups will become front page news,
so to speak. I think this is the real secret behind
all those celebrity diets: not the money and the
personal trainers but the certain knowledge of public
humiliation should the tabloids catch a glimpse of
cellulose. We promise to be nicer than the tabloids,
of course :-).

If that sounds too awful for you, keep a calendar.
Slash out every successful S day. Every day you make
will make you care more about not breaking your
streak. Don't let yourself think for a moment that
you're not officially on this. 

Hope something here helps. Bug us incessantly if it
doesn't.

Reinhard
