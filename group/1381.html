I am diabetic and monitor my blood sugar before going to bed and on getting
up.I do have some natural insulin left and raw veggies aren't hurting the
levels.I'm running tight as I've got some eye problems which I don't want 
to
get worse.

&gt;
&gt; Hey Hana, GREAT suggestion! I too have had problems in the
&gt; evening. I will venture a guess that this is a very common thing
&gt; for us all. I think it is a great idea because it is a PLANNED
&gt; meal...Clearly it would still benefit us to have less after a
&gt; certain hour, but to paraphrase Mr.Reinhard from his magnus opus, 
I
&gt; don't think anyone ever got fat from eating beets.
&gt; And your plan to have nutritious stuff is really great!
&gt; Watchout though..Try not to make that meal very late. Unless you are
&gt; coming home from work at some ungodly hour, and even then, do make
&gt; an attempt to go to sleep with as little food in your stomach as
&gt; possible. We all have been told not to go to sleep with food in our
&gt; bellies.
&gt; Heres why: I was taught to understand that if you eat something
&gt; like fruit or really anything, but especially anything that will
&gt; affect your blood sugar, in the late in the evening, that will raise
&gt; your insulin level and, insulin directly inhibits the production of
&gt; growth hormone, which is usually released into our blood while you
&gt; sleep. ..During childhood and adolescence this hormone is what makes
&gt; us get bigger, and taller (I could swear that when my son was an
&gt; infant I would notice that he looked bigger, even after just waking
&gt; up from a nap, or the next morning, just changing infront of my
&gt; eyes!)And even though we are all grown up now, (at least physically)
&gt; we still need it. As an adult, growth hormone is key to our immune
&gt; system functioning properly, and now takes on the task of &quot;Repair
&gt; and Restore&quot; of all the cells in our bodies. And guess what,
&gt; no'ssers the more growth hormone we release, or was it growth
&gt; hormone factor, well one of them, cause they go together,,,,the more
&gt; fat the body burns. A plus for sure! It also makes the task of detox
&gt; much easier for the Liver, which like the release of growth hormone,
&gt; should be happening between say 11:00 and 3am. Unless we are
&gt; watching Dave Atells &quot;Insomniac&quot; lol...
&gt;
&gt; I have noticed this week, that since I am on a emailing spree, big
&gt; time!, I am not sitting and watching as much mindless tv and for
&gt; some reason. Probably the fact that I am doing something that is fun
&gt; and interesting for me, and using my hands. A great way to stave off
&gt; snacks, since you are simply to busy to be bothered with stuffing
&gt; your face with pretzels...versus tv where you are sitting, or in
&gt; most cases &quot;sprawling&quot; in front of that thing, seeing countless
&gt; commercials for Dr. Angus! and Popeyes Giant mega chicken buckets.
&gt; Actually they are really kindof grossing me out these days...
&gt; Besides typing emails, anything you can do with your hands like,
&gt; playing an instrument, sewing, is great..Or, if the urge hits you 
of
&gt; course
&gt; Shovelglovving...I am going to buy mine today, then when it is
&gt; really snowing around here I will be ready :)!
&gt; You can't eat, unless it's through an iv, if you are using those
&gt; hands for something else!
&gt; I didn't weigh myself today, but I know I look alot less
&gt; &quot;big boned&quot; this week..Something is going right :)
&gt;
&gt; PS..Hana, you are clearly up on nutrition and suppliments. Very
&gt; cool! I have read that in addition to B complex suppliments,
&gt; betacarotene can be found naturally in all Orange fruits and
&gt; veggies, like yams, cantelope, carrots, taking in some extra
&gt; Magnesium and Calcium should help during PMS. This may explain why
&gt; for no apparent reason we sometimes will crave chocolate at that time
&gt; Chocolate, I've heard, has the most magnesium of any food on the
&gt; planet. The ancient Aztec food of the gods :)
&gt; And to quote a great sermon I heard from the Reverend Bruce of the
&gt; Community Church in NY,
&gt; Chocolate is &quot;Legal, Unscheduled and Over the Counter&quot;
&gt; But of course must be savored on only S days!
&gt; And my 8 year old son Richard is No ssing too, which I am very proud
&gt; of and glad about..He will have those habits down before he even has
&gt; a chance to get overweight. And of course it's great to have his
&gt; help.
&gt;
&gt; Ok I am really going to Sears now to get my future home torture
&gt; machine :)
&gt; Peace and Blessings,
&gt; Debbie &quot;Deb-Star&quot; Feder LMT and
&gt; Amatuer Clinical Nutrition Enthusiast :)
