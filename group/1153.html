Hello;

I've been away for a while. I got hooked on another site and have been
meaning to come 
back here for a progress report. When I started at the beginning of the 
year
I was always 
looking for reports from people who had been on nos for a while. Well, 
I
have.

I started the first of the year and never looked back. It was easy - I'm
still surprised how 
easy. Shoot, do what the intro says. That's it. You are never asked to
starve yourself, fill 
your plate exactly this way or that way. Use common sense.

I've lost twenty pounds, from 220 to 200 at 6', and several belt holes. 
I'm
happy, don't feel 
too heavy, but most of all I am out of the habit, as I was the first week 
or
two, of eating 
like a pig, constantly and anything. I have mentioned in a long ago post 
how
it really saves 
a lot of money.

For you scale watchers: I am too. I don't recommend it but that's what I 
do.
The good thing 
is I never cared what the scale said. I liked not eating like a pig, the
light, healthy feeling 
of hunger before dinner, and saving money. One thing I have noticed that 
may
be of some 
interest and comfort to those who worry about the stupid scale, I did not
lose steadily. It 
went down in stairstep fashion. For a month and a half or so I would see 
no
change on the 
scale. Then all of a sudden I would drop four or five pounds.

I don't know why that is. My feeling is that my body decided to be at a
certain weight and 
just kept it there out of orneriness. Then, after about a month and a half
it finally became 
convinced I was serious about not eating enough to maintain that weight 
and
said, &quot;Ok, 
he's serious. Drop four or five and hold steady again.&quot; Ha! I own my 
body!
It's in My house, 
fool! Yo!

I would like to get just under 185. I've been slack on my exercise because
of, well, uh, 
Iduhno. I'll still drop without exercising more, but I'll have to get more
active again to 
reach my final goal. In the meantime, forever if need be, I'm happy.

I recommend nos to anybody who asks. I'm surprised at how many don't try 
it.
Oh well, I'll 
only mention it once, then it's their business, their loss.

The site I have been hooked on lately is bronzebowpublishing.com/forum. 
The
exercises 
they talk about are a great complement to shovelglove. Some people in the
past have 
posted here that they exercise, lose weight, but their body shape is not
what they want. 
The body control exercises at the site are very good for teaching you to
carry your body 
well, good posture, etc.. I have no connection to the site other than as 
a
fan.

Well, that's my report. I'll be back. Nos is a life habit. Thank you
Reinhard. The simple 
beauty of it still amazes me. I hope you don't mind my recommending this
site to the 
other guys, too. I got good responses.

Tom
