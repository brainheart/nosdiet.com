yesterday and decided against putting brown sugar in it -- I used a packet of splenda 
instead. 

Today is going fine so far. Breakfast and lunch have been satisfying and not too much 
food (like dinner last night). 

I did realize last night that the reason I fail on every diet I have been on is 
because some occasion will come up where I eat off plan (usually vacation, but could 
be a holiday) and then have a hard time getting back on plan. While off plan, I no 
longer have boundaries and eat like there is no tomorrow. Consequently, by the time I 
get back ON plan, I have gained back some, if not all, of the weight I had lost. What 
I like about this plan is that the boundaries are very clear and simple. No food is 
completely off limit and is never more than 5 days away. 

So far, so good.

P.S. Chel -- glad to see you posting here. We will learn as we go!!

considered an &quot;S&quot;. Sure hope I didn't screw up my first day on the 

plan already!!!

&gt; Welcome, Chel. You're right; the granola bar is S. So is the box 
of cereal

&gt; 
&gt; Stay with it. You'll be glad you did.
