when i was a child we were allowed to have one treat from our bags a night for a few 
weeks of course back then the candy bars were larger so what if you and he went thru 
his bag and picked out maybe 20 items he really wants and he can have one a night as 
a treat..the rest you can give away or take to the office etc..

&gt; HI Deb, how about limiting the # of houses you go to this year-
less homes less candy, or weeding out the ones that arent his 
absolute favorites. face it you always get ones that arent any good. 
&gt; Good luck Julie
&gt; Uh oh guys! Frankenstein is going to be knocking on your door 
&gt; Sunday...What's a NOSser to do, as a candy-limiting parent, when 
&gt; it's Halloween?
&gt; Folks....Who can honestly say that they didn't *really* look 
&gt; forwards to all the candy from trick-or-treating, when you were a 

&gt; kid? I can't...It probably was my favorite holiday of the year, 
&gt; next to Thanksgiving (again with the food!)
&gt; I don't want to be a spoilsport with my son Richard, who is 
&gt; *already* looking forward to accumulating wealths of treats...One 

&gt; year, our candy lasted till mid Spring! But I also don't want to 
&gt; have a constant battle over how much he can have during the week, 

&gt; how much to keep altogether, etc...Plus, quite frankly, I don't 
want 
&gt; the temptation of having a dufflebag of candy and chocolates 
around 
&gt; for me either...Last year, I allowed Richard two candies an 
&gt; evening. They were small &quot;snack size&quot; ones...But I would not want 

&gt; him to have that much now, and in retrospect, that was really 
alot, 
&gt; and it is clearly not within NOS living rules.... Saying No to my 

&gt; sons very few pleasures is something I hate having to do...He is 
not 
&gt; a greedy child or spoiled at all... Any constructive feedback on 
&gt; troubleshooting this candy conundrum people?
&gt; Live Long and Prosper :)
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
