&gt; Hi Nathan, I think I would like the idea of a friendly 
challenge. 
&gt; I like Reinhard's chart idea. I have been around for awhile and 
&gt; have still been struggling but I don't stop trying.

....I have a little idea here... What about having us all report in 
after mmm, one month (the week goal is too short for me) and put our 
collective &quot;days on habit&quot; into a cyberjar... Some people will have 

more, some people will have less, some people will have none, but we 
can very unscientifically chart the progress of our efforts as a 
group. Probably seeing the number get higher will psych some people 
up... Knowing that you played a part in the monthly total increasing 
may be enough to challenge your team spirit, and then perhaps one 
will feel like trying even harder the next month...
The other thing is, like Mayo, I don't feel like necessarily 
reporting every week just out of laziness... By participating in 
this kind of challenge one must keep track of their own progress 
just to report in, but the gloomy dissappointed feeling of not 
having lost the most or whatever, doesn't come into play... whatever 
you can contribute will help the groups shared goal...
People come and go here but I am interested in sharing my month 
starting in April with you all.. If anyone else wants to join 
the &quot;Days on Habit&quot; challenge, let's meet again next weekend to take 

roll call and see what kind of response we get. We would have to 
think of a rewards system.... Maybe we could graduate up in &quot;belt 

colors&quot; like in Karate... How do they work? Something like there 
are eight levels and colors before you achieve blackbelt...
We could have belts for each half week on habit and then by the end 
of the month see if you have achieved Blackbelt status, with of 
course an honorary mention on the posts :)
I nominate Samurai Dieter and Lee to be co captains of the team this 
time! :)
Anyone second the motion?
Reinhard can be our beloved mascot :) LOL...
Love,
Deb
