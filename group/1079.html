Thanks! It helps so much when people are supporting you! I've 
joined some more weight loss groups, and they all seem really 
helpful, kind, and supportive. As long as I know that if I need 
help I can talk to some one, I think I'll do fine! (hopefully!) My 
mom and I are going to the gym more, and yesterday we walked two 
miles! (it was our first day back in like 3 weeks!) Anyway, I think 
I'm doing pretty good so far. On Monday we went to the movies and 
my mom bought us candy. I sat there the entire show with an open 
bag of M&amp;Ms in my lap and didn't eat one!! And, I can't eat popcorn 

because of my braces! I felt so good about that!! I've also started 
a journal about my weight, which I think will help me! 

Well, good luck to everyone!
Kimi

&gt; I know alot of people have been giving you advice. Probably 
because 
&gt; it strikes a cord with all of us. For me because I was in your 
shoes.
&gt; Good for you for being strong enough to confront those catty girls
&gt; Karma or whatever you want to call it will catch up with them. You
&gt; just keep being you. Whenever possible do things the hard way 
often
&gt; it will burn more calories, and make you appreciate the results 
alot
&gt; more. Your best friend sounds like someone you can really spend 
time
&gt; with. Why not just go for long walks with him. Very good for you,
&gt; burns alot of calories and gives you two a chance to talk.(Much 
better
&gt; than than a phone call anyway) It's always good to have someone to
&gt; talk to who supports you. I have mentioned before my weight 
problem
&gt; was always a problem. It just got worse in my adult years. I had 
an
&gt; older sister and she was always the skinny one. It didn't help 
things
&gt; when she was a senior in highschool and an A Cup, and I, her little
&gt; sister shot up into a DD cup when I was your age. She and her guy
&gt; friends teased me endlessly. I was the happiest with my weight 
when
&gt; I went on a bus strike walking two or more miles to my highschool
&gt; every day my sophmore or Junior year. That same year I was in an
&gt; aerobics and weight training class for the whole year. I didn't 
snack
&gt; because I never had money to buy stuff and my parents never had 
snacks
&gt; in the house unless you count leftovers. You are in a very special
&gt; time in your life. Live deliberatly. Don't get sucked into the 
just
&gt; going with the flow that happens in your age. Anyone who talks bad
&gt; about you behind your back is a toxic personality and is to be 
avoided
&gt; whenever possible. If what they say is hurtful consider the 
source,
&gt; After all the truth can hurt just as much as lies. If the person
&gt; critisizing you is worthy of your admiration and respect (ie 
someone
&gt; who loves you,or you care about)take the critisizm into 
consideration,
&gt; however if they are not, ignore it and do as you please. I hope 
you
&gt; are able to enjoy Nos and reach your goals without obssesing. If 
you
&gt; can do it you will be happier.
&gt; 
&gt; Exercise thing: I usually walk whenever possible. As I told Kimi 
to do
&gt; I do things the hard way whenever possible. I never use a bread 
maker
&gt; you wouldn't believe the exercise you get kneading a big lump of
&gt; dough. I dig out my flower bed the hard way with a shovel and my 
own
&gt; strength.( I was sore for days after I did that)Yes it took me 
longer
&gt; but I am so proud of that four foot by two foot patch. If you 
really
&gt; think about every way your body moves, you can come up with 
movements
&gt; everyday that you can do just a little bit differntly to make it
&gt; harder and still avoid hurting yourself. I recently started 
rotating
&gt; my pilates,step aerobics, and Richard Simmons tape so I am 
exercising
&gt; 6 days a week even if I don't go for a walk. I am probably 
ramping up
&gt; my routine because my 10 year class reunion is just around the
&gt; corner.I don't really want to go(I only went to that school for a
&gt; year) but, I haven't seen some of my friends in so long I really 
miss
&gt; them. 
&gt; Your friend in health Melanie.
&gt; P.s for anyone who is wondering I haven't been absent because I was
&gt; cheating I have just been really busy, and barely able to check my 

e-mail
