&gt; Hi everybody
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like it could be any diet sufficiently low in carbs that 

you excrete ketones in your urine. Atkins describes this state as 
Benign Dietary Ketosis and advises that you can test for it using 
Ketostix, available at pharmacists and usually used by diabetics. 
I've heard on another newsgroup that for optimum weight loss you 
should not go deep into ketosis (deep purple on the sticks) but stay 
on the initial margins of ketosis (pale pink).
&gt; 
&gt; As for danger? Well, there seems to be a lot of research into the 

diets of the Inouit, the Masaai and other such groups who survive 
(indeed, thrive!) on very low carbohydrate diets that only supports 
a lot of the current thinking regarding cholesterol levels etc.
&gt; 
&gt; In my own experience, I feel very well and suffer few colds, 
coughs etc whilst low-carbing but I don't necessarily believe that 
one diet suits all. A friend of mine cannot stand low-carbing and 
feels physically sick whenever she tries it - perhaps the Eat Right 
for Your Blood Type approach has something to offer here?
&gt; 
&gt; I think that it's worth reading up about this so that you can make 

an informed decision before you decide to go for it. If you do 
decide to do it, don't lose sight of whether you feel well on it or 
not.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck to all 
&gt; 
&gt; Alison

&gt; ----- Original Message ----- its not dangerous however once 
you reduce your carbs to that level you may have a hard time ever 
adding them back to your diet.. i had the book but lent it ot my 
chriopractor and never got it back :) 
&gt; basically it talks about how you can do exercise on a low 
carb diet and dont need to have the carbs that everyone thinks you 
do when you work out
