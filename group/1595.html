There is hope for dyslexics, My daughter has graduated from University 
and
qualified as a teacher of young children, despite dyslexia. She is now 
in
charge of a class of 7- 8 year olds.
I have seen some brilliant programmes helping kids with behavioural problems
to overcome them. this is in Britain and it's not like the American
&quot;Bootcamps &quot;I've heard about. It involves rewarding good behaviour 
and
ignoring bad as far as possible within the bounds of safety.Try to find 
a
school that has this kind of ethos.Start the programme at home before you
apply, so you and your kid have something to offer a Principal.Agree with
your kid what the standards are you're wanting and also what the rewards
are. Make them small and not costly(Hugs are free) you don't want to
encourage galloping materialism. A trip out at the weekend as a reward for 
a
week's good behaviour. Also remove all artificial colourings and
preservatives from his/her diet specially those sweet sodas. The best candy
for health in kids is probably a high grade chocolate made from pure
ingredients. Swiss chocolate is excellent. Offer this as a reward for being
good and don't let him/her get behind with schoolwork. You have access 
to
programs of study on the Internet.
Hope some of this helps
Hana

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; well, i have lived thru day one... thanks for the encouragemnt , noSer's
&gt; my stress today, (and i had the power of the plan to hold on to) is 
that
my
&gt; kid is suspended from school ...he has developed serious bad attitude
secondary
&gt; to failure to properly diagnose and treat dyslexia and dysgraphia. 
i
cannot
&gt; believe that it has taken me to the 7th grade with him to finally get 
a
correct
&gt; diagnosis....we have been told since 3rd grade that he has a
&gt; visual/perceptual deficiet... ia m beginning to find out that no one 
would
even mention
&gt; dyslexia b/c that means that the school will have to provide him with 
a
speech
&gt; pathologist.
&gt; they are now saying that he should be sent to &quot;alternative school&quot;..( 
with
&gt; the hoodlums) i feel overwhelmed trying to figure out the right thing 
to
do...
&gt; i am currently looking for a school that specializes in kids with LD. 
it
is a
&gt; sickening , heart wrenching worry when you know that your kid is being
&gt; discriminated against....thanks guys for listening. donna o
