Hi Kevin,

Welcome and good luck! Here's my take on the two
issues you raise:

As for the pop, nothing beats water, obviously, but
you might want to consider tea as well. If you have
one of those hot water spigots at the cooler it's
fast, and if they give away pop, they probably give
away tea, too. If you are sensitive to caffeine, green
tea is very weak and supposed to have all kinds of
health benefits. Herbal teas have no caffeine. I'm not
crazy about tea, I prefer coffee, but it's just so
easy and less contentious in terms of health. It's
hot, so you drink it slow, and the little ritual with
the tea bag seems to fulfill my &quot;looking for oral
distraction&quot; requirement.

As for the pop-tarts/nutrigrain bars for breakfast
issue, I'm not a picky eater, and since my wife needs
to get up way before I do, I tend not to be in a huge
rush in the mornings. So I can't speak to your problem
from vast personal experience.

I've always considered cold cereal pretty quick, but
it sounds like you need to be out so fast you're
eating in the car... not the most conducive
environment to cheerio consumption. You know, 5 extra
minutes might put cold cereal within striking range.
Would setting the alarm clock 5 minutes earlier be out
of the question? Or could you keep a stash of cereal
and milk at work? Or do what I do, keep a stash of
oatmeal, nuts and dried fruit at work (though I
usually eat this for lunch). If you could do one of
these it would expand your horizons significantly.
There are *a lot* of different kinds of low/no sugar
cereal.

Bread is also a big category - it's not just toasted
wonder or thomases english muffins. Mix it up with a
different cheese and a different piece of fruit every
morning and even the same old bread can seem novel. I
don't know your exact tastes in this depeartment, but
spend some time seriously scoping out the bakery,
cheese and fruit sections are your supermarket.

I'll wrack my brains about it a bit, but for the time
being I'd suggest not letting this problem be a diet
breaker for you. Pop tarts are clearly out. But
nutrigrain bars might be considered temporarily exempt
until you can think of something less sugary. After
all, they are *marketed* as healthy, and all things
considered, are probably less awful for you than pop
tarts. Emphasis on 'temporary,' and don't let it be
every day. Hopefully you'll get enough alternatives
suggested here in this group (and by the mother of
invention) that you won't have to resort to this
often/at all.

&gt; I stumbled upon this site today through ask jeeves. 
&gt; I don't remember 
&gt; the question I had, but it wasn't even about weight
&gt; loss. I decided 
&gt; that this may very well be the way I've been looking
&gt; for to loose 
&gt; weight all this time. I've gained ~60 pounds in the
&gt; last 4 years, 
&gt; most being in the last 2 years. The other night I
&gt; decided I was 
&gt; going to stop drinking pop like I do...Which is
&gt; constantly. It's 
&gt; hard since I get it free at work, and the bottled
&gt; water here has a 
&gt; significant amount of sodium, so you just end up
&gt; more thirsty after 
&gt; drinking it, but I'm gonna do it. This is just one
&gt; step up for me, 
&gt; and I'm pretty sure I can handle most of it right
&gt; off the bat, and 
&gt; all of it soon. Thanks for making this availible.
&gt; 
&gt; Now for a question that I know has been addressed,
&gt; but not &quot;to my 
&gt; satisfaction.&quot; Breakfast, I wake up litterally 2
&gt; minutes before I'm 
&gt; supposed to be at work, and it's a 20 minute drive.
&gt; (yes I'm late 
&gt; every day, but that's a whole 'nother story) 
&gt; Nutrigrain bars and pop 
&gt; tarts have been a Godsend to me. Not only that but
&gt; I'm a VERY picky 
&gt; eater, and most common breakfast foods are not to my
&gt; liking. I do 
&gt; love a good bowl of Cheerios or something like that,
&gt; but I frankly 
&gt; don't have the time for them. Toast is great,
&gt; english muffins 
&gt; too...but every day? I don't think I'd like
&gt; that...Any other ideas 
&gt; out there...Maybe there was some of this addressed,
&gt; and I either 
&gt; glanced over it or missed it in the archive, sorry
&gt; if it is just a 
&gt; repeat. Thanks for the help!!
&gt;
