Hi Amy,

I think you've gotten great advice already, which I'm
just going to reiterate.

1) Too much muscle is a problem most of us here would
love to have. This isn't something that is going to
sneak up on you. You'll have to work your butt off to
have this problem. Though shovelglove group members
assure me it's *possible* to do this with shovelglove
type exercises, you'd have to do a lot more than 14
minutes a day.

2) Start slow. Underdo it. Do the moves in slow
motion. Pay careful attention to your body. If
anything hurts, stop immediately and take the next day
off. If it seems easy at first, that's deceptive.
You'll feel it the next day (hopefully just &quot;good&quot;
soreness, but still). It's kind of like cooking bacon:
you'll be more done than you seem. Don't feel
compelled to do the full 14 minutes and don't feel
compelled to go full steam the whole time. Not every
movement will be for you, pick and choose. Do not
worry about not getting enough workout. You'll get
plenty. Worry about getting too much.

3) Consider joining the shovelglove yahoo group, if
you haven't already. We've got members with an
astonishing range of backgrounds and capabilities: a
bunch of women (all extremely sexy and feminine, I'm
sure), competitive strong men, teenagers, &quot;seniors,&quot;
yanks, brits.

&gt; Thanks for the imput. I know now a days that being
&gt; fit is very
&gt; feminine and sexy for a woman. . I just want the
&gt; slim toned look (
&gt; like Reinhard's). I DON'T want to look like the
&gt; female version of
&gt; Schwarzenegger. :) Thanks for the response and a
&gt; sledge hammer will be
&gt; purached Wednesday (hopefully!). 
&gt; P.S. My back isn't as great as it could be. Any
&gt; precautionary measures
&gt; other than don't over-do it?
