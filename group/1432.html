I've been no-s'ing for a month now. Love the simplicity and have added 

another rule for myself: no reading diet books or articles. I've just been too 

obsessed with trying the newest thing for so many years and have basically been 

30 pounds overweight for that long. I join weight watchers every couple of 

years and lose 20, then gain it back. I've lost 4 or 5 pounds in the past month 

on this - and it's because of the delayed gratification - another word for 

sel-discipline. 

Anyway, I posted today because of your message, Hana. I have a 19 year old 

son with Prader-Willi Syndrome. He has an aide at school as well, but still 

consistently gains 10 pounds a year, at least for the last 5 years. He is 

always hungry and will do anything to get food. Thank God most of us know when 

we've had enough. If we just tuned into that feeling more we'd all be better 

off. I think that is what No-S does for me - plus I love the relaxing of the 

rules on the weekends. I can resist during the week, knowing that I can have 

it on the weekend if I still want it!

Anyway, I'm working on Frank and no-s... Don't know if it's possible with 

him....

this child is hugely fat and waddles rather than walks. She has a carer

chooses a salad lunch for her. I've seen her idea of salad. She gets a 
bowl
of pasta salad , potato salad and coleslaw, all with mayonnaise dressings
