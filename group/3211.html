I have type 2 and it's a bit of a myth that you can get rid of it, but 
you
can reduce the symptoms for a time. It usually comes back though. It's
thought to be progressive, but I have read one expert who thinks it can 
be
stabilised with good sugar control, which is what I'm trying to do. I'm 
also
trying to get my weight down. I'm about 3 to 4 pounds down this week since
I came back from the USA. Where I ate loads, mainly salads.

&gt; &gt; McDonalds I bought a roast chicken wrap with salad and a pack 
of
&gt; fruits. It didn't cause my blood sugar to go up too high and I was
&gt; satisfied and didn't get into trouble. We all have free will and what
&gt; we eat is our choice not the vendor's.
&gt; &gt; Hana
&gt;
&gt; ....You are right! There's always a healthy option if one wants it.
&gt; Way to go Hana :)
&gt; I forget if you have type II or juvenille diabetes, but I will tell
&gt; you that if it's type II, you can pretty much reverse it completely
&gt; simply by getting the weight down...
&gt; Keep up the great work :) You can beat that disease Hana! You are 
on
&gt; your way :)
&gt; I had gestational diabetes with Richard, which could explain why he
&gt; was eleven pounds! At the time, I already was grossly obese for my
&gt; height, before I got pregnant... It was my high weight that tripped
&gt; the diabetes off, but with the hospital &quot;diabetes diet&quot; which 
in
&gt; essence was like NOS, ie: no refined sugar, and not huge amounts, 
I
&gt; thankfully didn't have to use insulin... My cholesterol also dropped
&gt; about 100 points once I was back in NY for a year and not eating for
&gt; three, like I did when in New Orleans, a town *not* known for it's
&gt; lean cuisine :)
&gt; As for McDonalds offering healthier choices, I am also happy to see
&gt; that this is a growing trend in fast food joints of all types...
&gt; I know that the vendor isn't the one to make our choices, but in the
&gt; end, most people, when you say McDonalds, won't have a yogurt side 
and
&gt; chicken salad pop into their mind..
&gt; It's gonna be a big clown with red shoes and hair, and the hamburgler,
&gt; and the very greasy, heart clogging classic
&gt; The Big Mac ;)
&gt; (and when they say I'm having a &quot;Big Mac Attack&quot;, they really mean 
it!
&gt; LOL)
&gt; Love,
