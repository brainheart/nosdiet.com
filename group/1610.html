Even though I'm not a parent, I read some interesting comments in
regards to this, so I figured I'd chime in with my 2 cents.

Somebody mentioned that it might be a good idea for you and your son
to volunteer somewhere. I couldn't agree more with that. I do a fair
amount of volunteering, and inevitibly see parents and children at
some of the events I volunteer for. As long as there is something
suitable for a child to do, it is a good experience for all involved.
- parents, kids, the other volunteers, as well as the people they
helo. And I've seen kids have fun and really get into that kind of
stuff if it's something they enjoy.

As for possible volunteer ideas, if you're part of a church, it will
probably have ideas (well, if it's a good church...) Other ideas
might be your local humane society, food/clothing banks, etc.

Another note, I think you are wise to at least question whether your
sun needs medication. Ultimately that's a decision only you and your
doctor can make, but having just read an article about &quot;the
overtreated American&quot; in a magazine I get that said how many Americans
are taking far too many medications, it is certianly worth researching
and examining each one to make sure it really is necessary.

Take care, and good luck with everything, especially sticking to the
No-S. It took me a long time to see any results, but it really does
work if you stick to it. :)

&gt; i would like to say thanks to hanna and deb for their support and
kindness 
&gt; regarding my son's LD's. ms hanna, i thank you for sharing your
daughter's 
&gt; story with me at a time when i really needed hope. you gave me hope,
and i didn't 
&gt; have to have sugar. today we saw a counselor, and found out that my
son is 
&gt; depressed....if someone asks you to do something that is impossible
daily for 7 
&gt; years, i guess that anger and frustration can become depression. so
now, we are 
&gt; needing to add a round of antidepressants to his daily Adderall
which he take 
&gt; for ADHD. it is my belief that physicians overmedicate , particularly 

&gt; psychotropic drugs....i have to ask myself, does he really need all
of this chemical 
&gt; intervention ? i am in the process of getting the school situation 

&gt; fixed...will this be enough? am i doing him an injustice if i
withhold antidepressants? i 
&gt; am a single mom and making all of these decisions by myself is
really hard. 
&gt; thanks for listening . i would appreciate any input.. thanks noSer's
donna o
&gt;
