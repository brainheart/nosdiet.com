Good job on finding out what works for you. 



I have that paranoia also about eating enough to make it to the next meal.
I'm hoping that will past after a couple of weeks. 



I'm kind of nervous about this weekend, because I don't want to undo the
good that I have done this week. 



~Lissa 

Hi everyone. I haven't talked in a while so I better before I 
really mess up. I am still doing good during the week. It really 
seems like a way of life now. I did have a little binge on Saturday 
afternoon but I know it wasn't as bad as before NOS. 

Alex's mom, I guess I do like everyone else regarding S days. I 
really try to choose a treat I can savor. In the beginning I did 
really binge on S days and it took about 6 months before I really 
could successfully stick to the rules, so be patient. I finally had 
to not worry so much about losing weight, but changing habits. Once 
I got my focus off the scale that helped but it took me a while. My 
new goal this week is trying to reduce a meal. I have been really 
filling my plate because I am so paranoid I won't make it to the 
next meal. Guess what, I do without passing out. This morning my 
breakfast was a little less and I didn't go crazy before lunch. My 
lunch plate was filled and I feel I ate too much. Maybe my stomach 
is shrinking a little. 

After doing NOS following the rules, I was down 4 lbs at 3.5 
weeks. Since I am not weight myself until the end of the month I 
let you know then.

Hang in there.

Thanks everyone else for all the good advice and talk.
