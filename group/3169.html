&gt; HI Deb and Everyone!

Yeah for you. we are now even sister as i am holding at 7# since the 
new year. i am very determined at this time in my life to do 
something good for me as noone else will or cares to. i have been 
pretty good this weekend actually, not really craving sweets for 
some reason though i did have a caramel macchiato yesterday. guess 
that does count. havent really been very hungry lately so taking 
advantage of that of course. :)) it is esp. hard as we have company 
for a week and food is all around but again im not hungry. have been 
drinking much more water and that makes me feel good about myself.

When i look back to what i was eating back in october- sweets 
galore, sodas. loads of coffee snacks galore i am totally amazed at 
the changes i have made in 5 months or so, incredible. No i havent 
lost a ton of weight, but i have conquered sweets- snacking- seconds-
over eating-sodas-and have learned to drink more water. So i am 
tooting my own horn today sorry everyone,but maybe some of you need 
to hear that it takes a while to get it right. it is a process and a 
slow one at that, but then again these 50# of extra didnt fly on me 
over night, but one day at a time. 
So what am i to do now that i am at a plateau? well i am eating more 
fruits and eating alot less than i have been these 5 months. 

Please keep me in your prayers as i am going thru a very rocky time 
in my life with dh, thats not dear by the way!! it doesnt look good 
and i must concentrate on my future. i havent been happy for a very 
long time just hanging in there, so this just pushes me further on. 
I am sticking with this EP but tweaking a bit.(see above)I may not 
post as often anymore but im still here, hangin tough with my friend 
Deberoo.and surviving :/ like on NOs one day at a time.

Love to you all, you guys are the best !

&gt; Hi Guys! Hope you all had good ones today :)
&gt; I wrote Reinhard the other day because, heh heh, I was in need of 

an 
&gt; extra pep talk and was too wimpy to complain to all you guys.. 
&gt; Needless to say, he is the top of the crop! The finest founder in 

&gt; the foundation, and gave this girl a little extra fat to chew 
&gt; regarding tweaking NoS so it kicks in... Thanks for listening 
&gt; Reinhard... I doubt that Atkins would ever get involved one on one 

&gt; with his following :) Everyone let's hear it,,,
&gt; Reinhard you are our hero, and we love you!!!!
&gt; You really deserve the honor of being called 
&gt; &quot;Guru&quot;...You are a most excellent person :)
&gt; So, I didn't want to mention weight loss for some reason here, 
&gt; because I guess I was worried that it only came from the fact that 

I 
&gt; have been sick for almost 3 weeks...And I was just overwhelmed 
with 
&gt; crappy feelings in general. I was thinking maybe it wouldn't 
really 
&gt; count and maybe it would just come flying back on me once I 
started 
&gt; eating normally again... Well it hasn't and I'm back to three 
meals 
&gt; a day... So I have lost another 3 pounds guys!!! And that was 
after 
&gt; about an 8 week plateau (the thing that was nagging at me)
&gt; Well, whatever. Sickness or not, it counts! I believe that makes 
it 
&gt; about 7 lbs since the beginning of the year!!!
&gt; I didn't drink any coffee for those weeks. And I normally had two 

or 
&gt; three cups, with sugar, before the virus. That's a habit which I 
&gt; thought for sure, would never change, but now I think I may try to 

&gt; keep coffee to only one cup a day (mmmm my brain is already 
&gt; revolting against this! LOL)
&gt; I intend to eat a lovely portion of Haagen Daaz Chocolate 
Chocolate 
&gt; Chip ice cream tomorrow to celebrate this extra loss!!!!
&gt; Paradoxical eh? I'm not gonna gain any of those pounds back.. I'm 

&gt; not worried, because at this point, even desserts are more 
enjoyable 
&gt; in moderation, and how can one dessert a week do someone in?
&gt; Tell me! Come on, tell me! LOL...
&gt; So what are you all going to dig into this weekend? I hope it's 
&gt; real yummy!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
