there is no risk however with Glad wrap and containers...because they use
another chemical.which is said to be safe. Also one can use plan old wax
paper in stead of &quot;Saran&quot; if you can't find &quot;Glad&quot;. I shall have 
to remember
the water bottle one, but normally I would have no reason to freeze them. 
If
this checks out as some urban legend, then they are wrong, as I have read

From: SStobarSubject: Cancer update from John Hopkins
news from Johns Hopkins


No plastics in micro.
No water bottles in freezer.
No plastic wrap in micro.

Johns Hopkins has recently sent this out in their newsletters worth
noting... This information is being circulated at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center.

Dioxin Carcinogens cause cancer, especially breast cancer. Don't freeze
your plastic water bottles with water as this also releases dioxins in 
the
plastic.

Dr. Edward Fujimoto from Castle hospital was on a TV program explaining
this health hazard. (He is the manager of the Wellness Program at the
hospital.)

He was talking about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that 
we
should not be heating our food in the microwave using plastic containers.

This applies to foods that contain fat. He said that the combination of
fat, high heat and plastics re leases dioxins into the food and ultimately
into the cells of the body. Dioxins are carcinogens and highly toxic to
the cells of our bodies. Instead, he recommends using glass, Corning Ware,
or
ceramic containers for heating food. You get the same results, without
the dioxins.

So such things as TV dinners, instant ramen and soups, etc.,
should be removed from the container and heated in something else. Paper 
isn
t
bad but you don't know what is in the paper. It's just safer to use tempered
glass, Corning Ware, etc. He said we might remember when some of the fast
food
restaurants moved away from the foam containers to paper. The dioxin problem
is
one of the reasons.

To add to this, Saran wrap placed over foods as they are nuked, with the
high heat,
actually drips poisonous toxins into the food, use paper towels.

Pass this on to your family &amp; friends &amp; those that are important in you 
.
