&gt; I'm from Michigan.

&gt; will be a little better than yesterday. I didn't do too badly - just one little 

&gt; slip. Habits are hard to break - but I started to eat something and then 

&gt; thought -- hey I shouldn't be eating this - so I threw it out. 
&gt; Chel 
&gt; ps -- I used to know someone by your name (same first and last) but I cant 

&gt; remember where from (maybe even highschool... so long ago) what area are you 

&gt; from?

&gt; &gt; Welcome to the group, Chel. I&quot;m new too. I will be starting tomorrow 
(was 
&gt; &gt; going to start today, but had another family gathering today!!). 

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I, too, think a list of unsure foods would be great.

&gt; &gt; Chel, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Welcome to the group! The thing that helps me with doing NoS is 

&gt; &gt; knowing that it works--I've tried it successfully and still use it. 

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anytime I am tempted during the week, I just remind myself that the 

&gt; &gt; weekend is almost here and I can have dessert or a snack. That helps 

&gt; &gt; to keep me on track. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As far as that granola bar, I'm not so sure that it is an &quot;S&quot; 
food. 
&gt; &gt; I have a post from a few days ago that hopefully someone will answer 

&gt; &gt; questioning the &quot;S&quot; category of certain foods. Unless the 
chocolate 
&gt; &gt; chips were the primary ingredient in the granola bar, I think that it 

&gt; &gt; would have been okay. But until I get my other post answered I can't 

&gt; &gt; say for sure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi... my name is Chel and I'm a new no-s'er! My friend Mary (Hi 

&gt; &gt; Mary!) passed on a link to the site -- which I loved -- so we both 

&gt; &gt; started today. I've done weight watchers (lost 90+ pounds -- 70 of 

&gt; &gt; it I found again) and Atkins, and most other diets under the sun. I 

&gt; &gt; think I will like this one... no counting carbs, points, fat grams, 

&gt; &gt; calories etc. Seems simple and realistic. I did decide to give away 

&gt; &gt; the granola bar I brought for lunch though, even though it is low fat 

&gt; &gt; it had chocolate chips in it, so I decided it was S. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; For those of you who have been doing this for a while -- any advice 

&gt; &gt; is welcome!
