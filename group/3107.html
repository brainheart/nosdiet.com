Hey, Dee!

That's mostly stuff I picked up from my unfocussed reading habits.
(She grazes books *and* food, ladies and gentlemen.) It's just most
people don't know anything about physiology, so I know infinitely
more, which works out to not all that much, really. LOL, I love math.
I probably sound convincing because I make sense? heh.

On Sarah Jessica Parker: you should look more closely at women's
bodies. Some skinny women have no muscle tone, some have a lot. Maybe
you could go look at a female muscle map, so you'll have a better idea
what muscles look like. Exrx.net has a good section, or just browse in
a bookstore or something. But I'll give you an example: look at female
arms. Are they plumped and smooth in a perfect cylinder? Or do they
swell with muscle at the deltoids (shoulder muscle) and the bicep? If
the latter, you should see their shoulders swell out then dip in then
swell out again at the biceps (and triceps).

Ok, that's a picture of some serious arm muscle. But she's super slim,
right? ...and I can't think of anyone with flabby arms off the top of
my head. Anyone else?

PS, glimpsed your picture, dee. You've got great dimples. :-)
