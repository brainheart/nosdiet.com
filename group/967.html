It's funny how &quot;can I make some exception?&quot; is
explicitly or implicitly the question in so many of
these posts. I don't want to seem harsh, people all
have their different natures and situations after all,
but there are (at least) 3 reasons why exceptions are
a bad idea for pretty much everyone:

1) the really obvious: it's calories.

2) the less obvious, but more important: you're
confusing the habit building portion of your brain.

3) the subtle but also important: it's actually easier
to be strict. This should be a big selling point for
all ye softies.

From: <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#fence">http://www.nosdiet.com/#fence</a>

&quot;It might seem counterintuitive, but strictness makes
things easier. There is no decision to be made, no
wrangling, no 'can I? can't I?'. You're
pre-disapproved, so forget it and move on to something
else. Thursdays and fruit tarts take on the aspect of
concrete walls, mine fields, and concertina wire.
There's no point even trying to cross.&quot;

Allan's example of trading the small lunch for the
pepsi is instructive: if you were smart and honest
enough to make this kind of tradeoff you wouldn't be
on this diet.

&gt; Reinhard mentioned this in a prior post and its on

&gt; 
&gt; Once you've decided to follow the no s diet, I feel
&gt; its IMPERATIVE that you stick to the rules. I have
&gt; had
&gt; trouble sticking to this diet (any, for that matter)
&gt; once I start making little exceptions, e.g. well its
&gt; only half a chocolate bar, I ate less at lunch so I
&gt; can have a Pepsi, etc. Before you know it you are on
&gt; the old 'seafood' diet - see food and eat it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Placing a fence around your eating habits, IMO, is
&gt; the
&gt; best way to ensure success, esp until your new way
&gt; of
&gt; eating has become a habit.
