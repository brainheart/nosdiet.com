----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Jennifer Dunbabin&quot; &lt;jenniferdunbabin@...&gt;
&gt;I have a theory that people who have relationship issues with food often 

&gt;have very senstive taste buds, and do enjoy food more. I've met people who 

&gt;are obviously at the other end of the continuum for whom food is just a 

&gt;fuel. They miss out on a lot, but a always skinny.

That's a pretty good theory, if you ask me. I used to have a *very* skinny 

friend, one of those that would forget to eat all day, then finally get 

hungry and decide what she really wanted to eat, then get into the car and 

drive to town to get it, if it wasn't something in the house. Weird.

On the other hand, one day she was watching me eat something and I wondered 

why she was staring, and she said, &quot;I love to watch you eat because I can 

tell that you *really* enjoy your food!&quot; She said it wasn't like that for 

her. Maybe that's why she had to go in search of something extra-special 

instead of just enjoying what was already in the house. It was a little 

embarrassing at the time she was staring at me, but I think this fits your 

theory.

Diane
