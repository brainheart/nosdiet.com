Hi all,

Last time I posted, I got many supportive responses. I was all gung-ho, 

blathering on about how I was going to post everday, mark off successful 

days on my calendar, etc. Of course I did none of those things...

The only thing that gives me hope that one day I'll get this is thinking 

about Lee's experience. She said it took her six months to finally get it, 

so instead of giving up, I'm going to start again. The bad thing about it 

all is that No-S is not hard to do (at least in theory). There aren't a 

hundred rules or pages and pages of forbidden foods to avoid. I mean, if I 

can't manage to do this, there's no hope for me...

My worse times are afternoons at work, when I'm prone to snacking. And 

evenings after dinner, when I'm prone to snack even more.

My worse No-S day is Friday. For some reason, I can't seem to revoke the 

long-standing permission I've given myself to gorge from Friday through 

Sunday...

Anyway, today is Thursday, so I'll deal with Thursday. I thought Karen's 

mention of Stevia was a good thing. Why am I still putting sugar in my 

morning coffee when I have Splenda in my pantry?

What's done is done, but for today and tomorrow I think I need to post after 

each meal. And tomorrow, I'll use Splenda in my coffee...

Thanks.

Valerie
