No matter what diet you are on, you are going to
&gt; overeat on Halloween. You are going to overeat on
&gt; Thanksgiving. You are going to overeat on Christmas.
(replace these with your respective national/religious
&gt; holidays). You might as well enjoy it. 

....Hi Rein, I figured you'd chime in sooner or later, thanks :)
I totally agree, and it's especially a happy holiday for the kids.
Thanksgiving is more up my alley.

&gt; A few days a year are not going to ruin you. The bigger danger is 

that you'll hold reluctant holiday excesses against
&gt; yourself and get demoralized for the post holiday.
....I'm not going to beat myself up ever again for any transient 
excess, S day or Non, I have decided that I deserve my undivided 
support and love. Plus, this new way of structuring my eating has 
been so beneficial to me...I don't consider it &quot;dieting&quot; anymore 

(I'm not sure if I really ever did since it's so radically, and 
distinctly separated from the dieting &quot;pack&quot;) I am looking forward 

from here on till forever, no regrets... that kind of thinking is 
the problem...

It's the leftovers, both physical and psychological, that are the 
issue.

....THIS is my main point and concern. I just don't want, as I said 
before, duffle bags filled with &quot;bite size&quot; candy to be staring me 

or my son in the face every day...Neither of us would win a 
willpower battle with a cute little hersheys kiss, taken alone they 
are so innocuous looking, but as I recall, last year even when I 
allowed 2 candies an evening, I would find 5 candy wrappers stuffed 
behind a couch pillow while cleaning the apartment or stuck, of all 
places, behind my dirty laundry bag (hows that for metaphor) and 
that just proves that the little cute candies are just 
irresistable... I know I sound like Scrooge or the Grinch, trust me 
I am neither...I told Richard he could eat candy all day long on 
Halloween as long as he brushes his teeth at the end :)

&gt; 
&gt; Halloween is the S-day par excellence. It's a holiday
&gt; where the central form of observance is the eating of
&gt; sweets. I for one intend to observe it devoutly this
&gt; year. 
&gt; Reinhard

....Are you gonna wear a costume :) :) :)
Peace and Love,
Deb
