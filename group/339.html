 Group,
I am a mother of four, married for 8 years, and a first grade 
teacher and a private christian school. My children are 2, 3, 6, and 
7 (three girls and my son the baby). I am the baby myself coming 
from a family of 2 sisters and 1 brother. I'll be turning 28 on the 
25th of this month and at the realizaton that I am klnocking at the 
door of the dreaded mile stone of 30! EEK
My love is for teaching and my talent is writing. The written word 
(although often misspelled!) has been a great outward expression of 
inward anguish caused by a troubled life. My backround is that of 
abuse, neglect, eating disorders, alcoholism, drug addiction, and 
other various sorces of either self inflicted maltreatment or that 
of others. 
Alright go get a tissue, compose yourself, and finish reading. 
Don't feel bad for me just yet! All of these severe endeavors God 
has used to shape who I am today. I am able to do at 28 what some 40 
year-olds have told me would kill them or at least severely depress 
them! Humor is a huge part of my life. One of my mottos... &quot; When 

you stop laughing at yourself that's when you truly begin to die.&quot; 

Why am I not angry with God for letting me go through all I have? 
Well simply put He didn't do it! In the most part man, and sometimes 
women, have. The rest was me putting my faith in everything elce but 
Him. So I am partly to blame too. I don't appologize for my faith or 
even mentioning Him in this post. My Lord is my strength and shield!
I am really looking forward to this new way of life (the no s 
diet). I thrive on routine (bulimia is an extreme exapmle of this) 
and this will definately help foster that side of me while at the 
same time facilitating a healthier lifestyle. Thank you Reinheld!
Saleta
