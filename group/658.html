Danielle, you should try some kind of diet soda. I have been drinking Fresca for 
years now and I love it. Other kinds are also good. When I first started drinking it, 
it was hard to get used to the taste. But after about 2 weeks of drinking it 
exclusively, I tried to drink regular soda, and it was really nasty. It tasted like 
medicine or something. A few years ago, I tried to get my hubby to go off soda and 
drink diet Coke but he didn't want to. I told him to just drink it exclusively for 2 
weeks as a test to see if he could get used to it. So he took the challenge, and it 
had the same effect on him as it had on me. He couldn't stand the taste of regular 
soda anymore. Give it the 2 week challenge. But don't cheat! Absolutely ZERO regular 
sodas. I PROMISE you that you won't miss your soda a bit! It's definitely worth a try 
at 120-150 calories a can of soda, right? Good luck!

Oh, an update on me - I have done pretty well so far today. It's Sunday, and at 
church we have doughnuts every Sunday between Sunday school and church services. 
Today, I only had one cruller. I don't plan on snacking on anything else today except 
maybe some zucchini this evening right after dinner. I figure snacking on fresh 
veggies shouldn't be too bad. Most diets have fresh veggies as a free food. I might 
slice a bell pepper too. I dip them into ranch dressing. I'm working hard on not 
overeating at mealtimes too. My hubby fixed us omelettes with mozarella cheese and 
sliced steak, and I also ate one slice of whole wheat bread - toasted - with it. I 
will have an apple two hours after my meal when the food has had a chance to digest. 
I'm actually combining four diets into one. :) :) High protein/low carb - 3 apples a 
day - food combining - no S diet. :) I think it should work pretty well. I won't 
consider the apple I eat an hour before each meal as a snack. And I
also won't count fresh veggies I eat in the evening as a snack. I also plan on 
drinking a LOT of my flavored sugar free waters. I have been drinking at least 2 
large bottles of it every day. I NEED to lose 25 lbs by June, so I'm hoping this diet 
strategy plus walking every day will do it.

I'm not saying I do this perfect yet,but something is better than nothing.I do see 
myself not eating as much.

I am also starting NoS tomorrow. The soda is going to
be the worst for me. I've tried to break the habit,
but I don't like coffee or tea.. so far I've not found
a replacement for my habit. I started a new job and
I'm the fattest person there. I really feel like I
stand out. This is the most I've ever weighed. I'm
starting with baby steps. If I can lose a lb a week
I'll be happy. It's weight coming off, not going on
that counts. I like the idea of a food diary. I have a
small notebook so I can write down everything that
goes in my mouth. Snacks are my downfall also. But
that will be easier to stop than soda. I have my water
bottle ready for work tomorrow. 

Any tips for working moms? I'm working on organizing
my day/time better so that I'll have more time for sit
down meals (three a day) instead of grabbing something
and going.. which leads to bad bad snacking while out.


Thanks for reading this far!
Danielle

Hi All, 

I've seen a couple of posts talking about how people have put on the
2lbs they lost over the week back on over the weekend. I don't know
about any one else but I know that my weight can fluctuate by a couple
of kilos (call it 5lbs) just over the course of one day. 

While not as elegant or as non-intrusive as the noSdiet, The Hacker's
Diet has a really good excel spreadsheet that can be used to track
your weight loss and help you figure out if that surprising number on
your scale is part of a trend or just a fluke. Also, it's free.

Wondering where you plan on putting it? I sit on the undernet all day 
long in a dead channel...Wouldn't mind adding one more to spice up some 

conversations from time-to-time.

Subject: Re: Hello

Interesting way of finding the site. 
I thought giving up soda was going to be the worst thing ever for me...I 

drank 2-3 cans of coke a day, and a bottle of root beer every-other 
day. I pretty much have forgotten about the constant pop thing. I 
occasionally crave a coke, or a root beer, but on those days I either 
give in, and end up not drinking the whole thing, or say &quot;you've got x 

more days until Saturday&quot; when I usually allow myself one. It's not 

THAT bad is what I'm getting at...At least for me.
I too don't like coffee or tea, I drink water, lots of it, then milk for 

dinner. I used to do the water bottle thing, but I realized I was 
creating a lot of extra garbage, and spending a lot of money I didn't 
need to on them. I bought a water filter (I really like water when it's 

filtered) and a bottle that's got a twist on cap that's connected to the 

bottle. I fill it up every morning, it lasts me half the day, then I 
fill it up for lunch at a fountain at work. I'm drinking two liters a 
day, I dont' know how much you're supposed to drink, but I'm sure I'm 
above that..And it's great. Milk I take the money I'm saving on food, 
and have Oberweis delivered to me (for those of you who don't have that 

offered to you, it's a higher quality milk, and I can really taste the 

difference when I step back down to a generic milk). 
As for tips for not doing the grab and run, I'm still trying to figure 

some of that out...I tend to work 60+ hours a week, and do much grabbing 

and running. Though, I do have the benefit of being as single as they 
come. :)
Anyway, welcome and good luck!

I am really curious -- what does this brand of milk have that makes it

it
doesn't taste like store milk at all!&quot; Gee, wonder why? ;-)

I've been trying to make every meal an actual, honest to goodness sit down
meal. It's hard, but I am getting good at churning out some fast meals

Subject: Soda Pop

Or as we called it back in Gloucester,MA, tonic....Ihave noticed a lot of concern 
about drinks lately in the groups letters. Not to get into another &quot;Nutrasweet&quot; 
debate, but if the soda is so important why not drink diet? That is what I did, first 
to get my caffine fix, without sugar, then switced to caffine free, so no sugar no 
caffine, and now days will go by without me even thinking of a pop. I believe it is 
the sugar and caffine that hooks you, so rid of one, then the other, and since the 
&quot;no S&quot; is no sugar I would start with the diet pop. Bonnie
