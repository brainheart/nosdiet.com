&gt; Dear Deb....
&gt; You really should be a writer girlfriend! This is Roundell, 
almost getting to be Rondelle soon . Two lbs so far this month...I 
try to record on Sats, before any weekend damage. I was sooooo good 
yesterday, only extras were two cappiccinos, ice cream is overwith!

*Come on* Roundell Schmoundell I bet you are a size 12! :)
Thanks for the writer thing...I appreciate it :)

Too bad I can't write lyrics to songs (the handful of songs I have 
written were so corny even *I* would roll my eyes. LOL)
Also, I think in order to be a writer, artist, etc... you need a 
burning desire to do it and with me my moments can really come and 
go and aren't consistent at all. I'd never survive if I had to come 
up with stuff that had deadlines etc...I'd fold under the pressure.

Had a minor fight with my mom this morning (this is unfortunately 
the nature of our relationship...pretty dismal) because for the 
third time, even after I have painstakingly explained that both 
myself and Richard my eight year old, are cutting out sweets on No S 
days, and as respectfully as possible, requested that she not bring 
stuff that's off program into the house, she bought some of 
those &quot;hostess mini muffins&quot; and put them in my part of our food 

cabinet &quot;for Richard&quot;...When I told her that they are 350 calories a 

bag and not really a healthy meal choice, she, with great resistance 
at first, finally agreed with me and said she wouldn't &quot;ever get 
them again&quot; (her usual dramatic guilt trip) I know that she is just 

trying to be nice and get him some treats, but it felt a bit like 
she was trying to undermine my authority and decision about Richards 
consumption of sugar. After all, I was pretty clear that I don't 
want him, or me for that matter, to have that stuff staring at us 
daily. I felt angry that the box of muffins just showed up...I mean 
I am freakin 209 lbs..and I don't ever want Richard to share the 
same fate...

Actually, when I went totally out of control last Winter, and Spring 
and Summer, and was for probably the first time ever, allowing soda 
and ice cream several times a week, even Richard put on a few 
unnecessary pounds, and he runs around like an idiot. Since we have 
been NO Ssing he is back to the good slim weight of the previous 
Summer! As a child I was pretty active. Infact I was really slim 
and healthy, bodywise. I only started to gain weight after around 
7th grade. Richard is in 3rd and I figure Carpe Diem, get him on 
the right path now, before bad habits get too much of a foothold. 
And for me, it's really helpful to have him joining me in my 
efforts...

Lately, since he has dropped a few pounds off his tummy, he is so 
adorable, and has been coming up to me and saying &quot;hey mom, look you 

can see my Abs&quot; (last Winter he started to get a really round tummy 

from all that sugar)
Self esteem doesn't fall out of the sky, it comes from our feelings 
of accomplishment from challenges we face and surmount. I was so 
happy that he felt proud of his &quot;Abs&quot;. It was really the outline of 

his diaphragm and ribcage, but who am I to burst his bubble? And he 
did really lose a considerable amount of fat, so I just said &quot;I am 

really proud of you!&quot; and let him enjoy his feelings.
Congratulations, again, on your success Rondelle!
That is wonderful :)
Peace,
Deb
