&gt; I just joined today. NoS Seems to be JUST what I'm
&gt; looking for, as my
&gt; recent weight gain (and the resulting
&gt; non-fittingness of my
&gt; underwear!) is due entirely to snacking, seconds,
&gt; and sweets!

Nice to have a fellow librarian on board. I bet the
odds of our being &quot;similarly minded&quot; are that much
greater.

&gt; this immediately

&gt; just about every other solution seems so

Thanks for this great complement. For those who don't
know, Occam's razor is a philosophical principle that
the simplest, most straight forward answer is the most
likely one.

&gt; i was even 
&gt; thinking of going on a juice fast, but wondering how
&gt; i'll handle it 

I've been hearing bad things about juice fasts (though
my neighbors love it). Something about how it was next
door to binging.

&gt; when we take my 80-year-old father out for lunch, as
&gt; we do every 
&gt; Sunday. now i know how i'll handle it. like a
&gt; normal person.

This is the idea. Normalcy in eating used to be
enforced by social eating structures, the fact that
food was relatively expensive if not scarce, etc. All
the noSdiet is doing is standing in for these absent
structures. It's profoundly normal.

&gt; shovelglove group?
&gt; 
&gt; how light can one get those sledge hammers? (i'm&gt;
thinking maybe 
&gt; aluminum on balsa...?)



There was a gentleman from texas who got a 4 pound
sledge for his young son.
