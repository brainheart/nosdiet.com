&gt; I know we don't discuss health and food issues much on this list 
(because that's the OLD diet mentality), but in light of recent 
posts about the evils of soft drinks, I think some of you would find 
this newsletter interesting. There's a good explanation of why the 
high-fructose corn syrup in soft drinks could be a major cause of 
our current obesity epidemic.

Hi Diane, I personally appreciate any info that passes my way re: 
health and food issues, and contrary to what you wrote, don't feel 
that simply educating oneself on nutrition is part of the old diet 
mentality :)
Please continue to post these type of educational info, as I believe 
most people would consider it &quot;food for thought&quot;.
Bottom line, human decision is what can make or break a successful 
diet, not some evil food molecule (it would be rare for you to find 
any site which touts the &quot;health benefits of corn syrup&quot;). 
Unfortunately we have entered the gen xl age, and sadly Diabetes is 
considered to be a full fledged epidemic now. Most people don't even 
realize that if you simply reduce your weight, you can completely 
reverse type II Diabetes. I am not pro soft drinks and totally 
agree with limiting or eliminating them completely, but even if a 
person never drinks soda or high fructose stuff, if they are obese 
they may wind up with diabetes.
Thank you for &quot;Dr Dianes Health Corner&quot;
The cinnamon info was stuff I have never heard of! 
Very interesting :)
Peace,
Debbie
