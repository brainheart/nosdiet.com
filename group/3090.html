i couldnt do it &quot;indefinitely&quot; julie, and it took me so little to revert to 
my old eating habits .. for one week it went great.. even my s-days went 
great...
i know i told deb &quot;nothing is worth ruining ur day for&quot; and eventhough i 
still think this way... the fact remains the same: it took so little to ruin TWO DAYS 
for me......! just one phone call from my ex, followed by a reeeeeeeeally bad day at 
college was all it took for me to feel it s&quot;OK&quot; to screw up..! not solely 
is it a matter of &quot;comfort eating&quot; but more of &quot;every single aspect of 
my life is a total mess so why sould this be an exception?&quot; - kind -of - 
thing...!
i couldnt handle it as well as u did, deb..
and my screwing up wasnt a matter of quantity but of returning back to my 12 meals 
per day.. no shovelgloveing.. and loads and loads of &quot;seconds&quot;.. i am not 
really a &quot;sweets person&quot;.. but even a packet of those came in handy... he 
he he...!
so i screwed it up... and i ll try not to do it again (a more bright attitude)... but 
i am sort of worried cause nosdiet worked great for me as long as i was feeling 
great..... it didnt work when i was depressed.....!
love
dee
