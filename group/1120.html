&gt; Kevin! Welcome! It sounds like you have had a long journey when it
comes
&gt; to making our bodies fit and healthy. The diet plans you have
followed..
&gt; like weight watchers....do have healthy meal plans. But like any
program,
&gt; it does not do any good if it is not the plan for you. 


Hi Kate,

Thanks for the welcome and the encouragement. You're right, I have
learned some good habits from Weight Watchers - I just had a difficult
time following all the rules, keeping track of points, etc. The main
thing that appeals to me about the No S Diet is that there are only
three very simple rules. Somehow it's easier to say no to an
unhealthy snack outright since it's not mealtime, than it was to try
and figure out how many points I could spare. Of course, I'm only on
day 2, so I'll report back in a couple of months. :)


&gt; One thing nice about your experience from these plans is you have
learned
&gt; what is a good meal, the right foods, and so on. When taking on the
&gt; challenge of the NoSDiet, you do need to have some knowledge of what
you are
&gt; doing, proper portion size, foods from all food groups, ways to prepare
&gt; foods in a healthy manner. 

All very true. For now though, I'm mainly trying to break the bad
habits of eating sweets and snacking. After a month or so, once I've
reprogrammed those habits, I'll start focusing more on portion size
and eating balanced meals. That's not to say that I'm going nuts, and
using a serving tray as my one plate for my three meals, but I'm not
really worrying too much about the contents of those meals for now. 
One step at a time.


&gt; What I do find wrong with the plans, like weight watchers and
simmons, for
&gt; myself , is the attention to food. The unnecessary meals and snacks. 

&gt; Eating Eating Eating. For goodness sake, I truly believe you only
need so
&gt; much food to fuel your body, and after that, STOP EATING! 

Yeah, it's pretty hard to break the unhealthy habit of eating too much
when you have to spend that much time and energy thinking about food. 


&gt; So....welcome! Keep making changes every day, and enjoy the new way
you will be feeling.

I'm not really expecting much in the way of short term results. I
figure, it took me 20 years to put on all this weight, so if it takes
me a couple of years to take it off, that's okay.


&gt; BTW.....love your lyrics!

Thanks! 

- Kevin
