I think those are very true statements. My grandparents and greatparents worked hard 
farming and caring for a home without any modern convenience. They went to bed early 
and rose early. If the sun was up they were busy taking care of farm, home, and 
family. They ate simple, but hearty filling meals three times a day. They drank alot 
of water and milk, no sodas or sugar filled beverages. My mom and I were discussing 
this yesterday. How do we get back to that way of eating in our busy distracted 
modern lives?

Gulliver (of 
Gulliver's Travels) who said that after spending time with the 
horses, he began to like the taste of oats. All his ailments 
cleared up and he said he never felt better.

I know we can't use a storybook character for medical advice; but it 
was more than the oats that made Gulliver healthy--he was living in 
a healthy society.

Also, people who work with their hands for a living, like farmers, 
for example, don't have time to graze all day long. Idle hands get 
into all kinds of trouble.
