 I just wanted to add that we all know when we have eaten too much. I =
think the main point of this way of life change (not going to call it a 
&quot;di=
et&quot;) is to monitor yourself and not eat to excess. Eating food is just 
lik=
e everything else in life. Nothing is good for you in excess. I have pers=
onally tried to look at food more as fuel for my body and not so much as a 
=
pastime. Think of yourself like a car. For example, you wouldn't fill your=
gas tank up until it overflowed and spilled everywhere would you? Also, 
h=
ow many of us would stop to get gas if we didn't need it? Maybe a bad anal=
ogy, but it works for me. Now, I am not preaching here, I have been known 
=
to snack here and there, but at least now I am aware of what I'm doing, 
not=
just absentmindedly eating. When I actually stopped and noticed how much 
=
food I was taking in during the course of the day, well no wonder I'm overw=
eight.=20
=20
Weight isn't really something that I have actually had a problem with =
all of my life. What I meanby actually is, there were times in my life 
whe=
n I thought to myself that I was FAT......to use the f word. When I look 
b=
ack at myself at 17 and 150 (my ideal weight according to the government) 
p=
ounds, well that doesn't seem so fat to myself at 27 and 265 pounds. I 
thi=
nk what happened was those bad eating habits that I formed in my teenage 
ye=
ars carried over to my 20's and the ample amount of exercise didn't. Actua=
lly my children eat very well. I let them have 1 cookie if they eat their 
=
dinner at night....which consists of veggies and good stuff. Rarely let 
th=
em eat fast food, they drink water all day, not juice and koolaid.....I 
don=
't think I've ever even made Kool aid for them. I do this because, I know 
=
what a problem I have had over the past years with weight and I don't want 
=
them to fall into my bad habits. Well, I guess I needed to practice what 
I=
preach. Basically I
decided to make myself eat the way that I make my children eat.=20=20
=20
My wake up call was a recent visit to the doctor, I have higher than averag=
e cholesterol which I attribute to my weight, now I know that there are 
man=
y other factors and high cholesterol can be hereditary and all that, but I 
=
feel like if I were more active and weighed less my cholesterol would proba=
bly be better, it's still under 200, but I am only 27, if it's 188 now, 
wha=
t will it be when I'm 50. I want to live to see my grandchildren. So, I 
d=
ecided to lose weight and cut out meat. PLEASE don't think that I am sayin=
g meat will kill you.......that is not at all what I'm saying here, I just 
=
made a personal decision that I would do it for myself. I eat vegeburger 
(=
<a href="http://kellogg.marketlocator.com/kelloggs/us/knutr.nsf/webcategories/worthi=">http://kellogg.marketlocator.com/kelloggs/us/knutr.nsf/webcategories/worthi=</a>
ngton?opendocument&amp;Cat=3DWorthington), which has a good amount of protein, 
=
low in fat and has no cholesterol. Other than that I follow the no s diet.=
It really works for me because, it's not radical, it's basically common 
s=
ense. What doctors and
our mother's have been telling us for years. I stopped drinking cokes, 
we=
ll Dr. Pepper was my favorite (I'm from Georgia and no matter what kind of 
=
soda it is, we call it Coke). I can't do diet coke, it gives me migraines.=
Although, I don't think there's anything all that bad about it (which I 
h=
ave no scientific proof of, just a gut feeling..LOL), the only thing that 
c=
omes to mind is, that if I was drinking diet coke, I wouldn't be drinking 
w=
ater.....and it takes me ALL day to drink my 64 oz. I kind of have a rule 
o=
f my own here, I don't get anything else to drink until I've drinken all 
of=
my water for the day. After that, I love tea, so I drink tea. However, 
a=
nd again being from Georgia, we drink our tea SWEET, something that I have 
=
had to stop doing. To me, unsweet tea tastes just like water, so why not 
j=
ust drink water...LOL.=20=20=20
=20
I don't know how this turned into my life story. I just started typing 
and=
rambled. I have really enjoyed this list and everyone's posts. Trust me 
=
I have seen much more heated debates, than the aspartame one of yesterday, 
=
on other lists.....so I think we're all doing great here. Let's keep up 
th=
e good work!=20=20

&gt; Suddenly it's become very complicated with everyone
&gt; discussing what's good for you and what will kill
&gt; you. Let's remember what drew us to this diet in
&gt; the first place. The simplicity. No snacks. No
&gt; seconds. No sweets. Period.
