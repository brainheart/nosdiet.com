&gt; Hi, I'm Amy. I'm 23 and I live in Alabama.. Here is 
&gt; my problem and concern. I am a fastfoodaholic. Now I know that 
fast food should be sparce and eaten in moderation anyways, but is 
it off limits for this diet? 

Hey Amy :)
Welcome to the group!
The quick answer is, no fast food isn't prohibited.
What is are:
Seconds (in fast food land you could call that Supersized portions)
and foods whose main calories come from sugar, ie: soda, shakes, 
donuts etc...)
the exception is that you can have whatever you want on S days.
This doesn't mean be a complete moron and have a gallon of Haagen 
Daz when you have an S day.
Snacks are &quot;when&quot; not &quot;what&quot;
If you want pretzels or chips with a meal, although it might not be 
the healthiest choice, it is considered ok as long as it's part of 
your &quot;one plate&quot; meal, so don't eat a whole bag of pretzels either.
So we are trying to eliminate eating between meals, eating seconds, 
and lots of sugar.
It will be nice to have some &quot;new blood&quot; here.
The groups members span the decades, and I will say that you are in 
the &quot;youngsters&quot; category...That is until you compare your age to my 

son Richard, who is eight, but fortunately he isn't overweight yet, 
and I hope God willing that he never gets that way.
Good luck and don't worry about &quot;stupid questions&quot; we are all full 

of them!
Peace,
Debbie
