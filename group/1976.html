a better gauge of success is the tape measure. I know for me there 
are times when the scale doesn't move but the inches are melting 
away. Remember, you have absolutely NO CONTROL over the number on 
the scale -- what you can control is what you eat and how much you 
move. Let you success be judged on your actions rather than the 
scale.

....Mary you are my hero! I second (wait no Seconds! LOL), I mean, I 
agree!
Cat, if your clothes are a little tight, that should be your wake up 
call, not the numbers on the scale. If I was great for two or three 
weeks and then the numbers didn't match up with my expectations of 
the scale, wouldn't it be better to walk away saying &quot;I tried my 
damn hardest and I am proud&quot; rather than &quot;I tried my damn hardest, 

and the scale is telling me to feel less than proud, or even 
crappy&quot;....If you actually woke up one day and gained ten pounds, 

chances are, there would have been body signals, and physical 
differences way before that happened. I'm not saying throw your 
scale out the window. Just don't let it rule you.
Can you try the &quot;slashing technique&quot; for three weeks and make it a 

point to wait to weigh yourself some other time... I will be doing 
that for the next 3 weeks, so see you on the 23rd :) (and probably 
before!)
Reinhard, it seems like a good addendum to the manifesto would be to 
include NoScales on NoS days.... It's just negative reenforcement I 
say! So kiss my scale! LOL
Love,
Deb
