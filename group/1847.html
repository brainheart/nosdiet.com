Good for you, Valerie! Remember Winston Churchill's famous speech? =) (If 

not, I'll quote it next time.) Like you, sitting at my desk at work is the 

most difficult time, if the work is boring (and it usually is). My reasons 

for snacking (especially on sweets) have always been (in descending order):

1. I'm bored
2. I'm overwhelmed/frustrated/annoyed
3. I'm tired

(Can you tell that I work at a market research company? LOL!)

For me, &quot;boredom&quot; doesn't mean I have nothing to do; it means I am forced 
to 
work on something that doesn't interest me at all (most of my jobs are like 

that--good money but not very intellectually stimulating). Once in a while 

I have gotten totally involved in a project that interested me, and I 
actually forgot to eat. This hasn't happened often but it was nice when it 

did--it showed me how much the issue depends on my mind and not my body.

Anyway, while NoS-ing, I have decided to buy a specialty coffee mix (one 

that's nearly as good as a snack) and have a cup of that when I think I'm 

really going to fall off the wagon. It's working pretty well. There are a 

few teaspoons of sugar in it but if it gets me through till lunch or till 

supper, I consider it well worth the 60-70 calories. At least I'm not 
chewing anything--that really gets your appetite started.

Yesterday I was really hungry an hour before lunch, and finally I ate a 

packet of peanuts. Then at lunchtime I wasn't hungry and couldn't properly 

enjoy the free lunch provided by the office! Another lesson learned. If we 

learn from each mistake, the failure will have some redeeming value.

My worse times are afternoons at work, when I'm prone to snacking. And
evenings after dinner, when I'm prone to snack even more.
