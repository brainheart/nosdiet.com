Yeah, I've looked at those calorie figures - it's one of the main things
putting me off, even for the regular lattes - I'm not sure if they
actually put sugar in them all, but they're clearly not the healthiest
things in anyone's book.

On the plus side, I quite like black instant anyway, and it's way
cheaper :)

&gt; Hi, Michael - Welcome back, and good for you! Did you see the recent post 

&gt; about the article saying that final success (changing diet habits) takes 

&gt; 10-12 genuine tries? (Reinhard added it to his webpage.) So, cross off one 

&gt; more of the attempts needed to get you to success! It's kinda like a cat 

&gt; having nine lives. =)
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I think coffee is fine, as long as you don't sweeten it 

&gt; excessively. Some of those specialty drinks can be 400 calories or more! 

&gt; You might be shocked if you look up some of them here: 
&gt; <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutrition_beverages.asp">http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutrition_beverages.asp</a>
&gt; 
&gt; I look at some of these borderline items (coffee with sugar, a piece of 

&gt; sugar-free candy, tea with milk, etc.) as temporary &quot;crutches&quot; which I 
won't 
&gt; always need. I think that if the item has 20-50 calories, or at least under 

&gt; 100, and it is performing the genuine purpose of getting me through till the 

&gt; next meal without being a real snack, I am still NoS'ing. Sometimes if you 

&gt; get really hungry before mealtime, a sweetened drink will calm the hunger 

&gt; pains just enough to get you through. Remember that a teaspoon of sugar has 

&gt; 16 calories, and estimate what you're using, then try to account for it in 

&gt; your next meal--perhaps skip a piece of bread or something.
&gt; 
&gt; I think crutches are good things to use when you can't walk on your own 
yet!
&gt; 
&gt; Just my opinion,
&gt; Diane

&gt; One question - where do people think starbucks coffee sits? It's clearly
&gt; liquid calories, but it's also coffee and I'm not sure if it's anything
&gt; other than milk and coffee, both of which are acceptable.
&gt;
