Sounds like you are going to be very successful at this. Look at how aware
you already are about everything you are eating. That is such a major step.
Have a good weekend!

Mon I did pretty well, until the in between time of breakfast and
lunch. Messed up and had a snack. I just wasn't thinking. tried to
make up for it by putting less on the plate at lunch.
Tuesday did pretty well. Messed up and had a popsicle it was really
hot day. Next time I will go with an icecube.
Wed. Did well even took the kids on a walk. Had to try the zucchini
treats at the tasting table at a church function. Technically it was
my dinner though. 
Thursday. I got stressed out and had a bowl of Ice cream. 
Now as far as today goes so far so good. I know looking at this week
so far has been a bust so I may be doing this for more than Aug. this
time around it is taking more will power than before. Reliesing
ourselves of the weight we cling to is easy on paper and hard in
application. I hope you are all sticking to your goals and doing
better. Your friend in health, Melanie
