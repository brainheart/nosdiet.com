Lee,
I hope I'm not the DH you are upset with. Please tell me it isn't
so. ..... Good solution, moving. I'm sure when I start a mood, my wife
thinks of moving. ; )
I was dreading the scales today (I have the long standing habit of
weighing every work day), but was surprised today. I had lost 3 tenths
of a pound and over Halloween weekend too (of course a gain is expected
after 2 S days). It was a double surprise because I've had 2 straight
weeks of gaining until last week (dropped .4 lbs). My first 5 weeks of
noS I lost a little something each week, 6th week stayed the same, but
oh those two gainers! 
A few sour notes.... kept singing, but couldn't seem to find the
key. Looks like I may be able to hear the melody again. 'Bout time.
..... Now few men will admit mood swings (you gals recognize moods
in us). Some days just pays to lay low and stay away from us.
Difference is most women will own up to their moods. Us guys don't want
anyone to know, and we think if we won't admit it, no one else can see
them. Silly us!
P&amp;L, David H.

OK, I feel better. Moving can help work it off. I didn't grab 
food to feel better either so I am glad about that. DH is better 
too. I wonder if those candies I had earlier affected my mood?. 
Well onward.

Thanks again everyone.

The men are probably saying typical female and mood swings. :)
