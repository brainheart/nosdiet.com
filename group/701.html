Hi Johny,

There actually are anchor tags for each section buried
in the html, it's just a pain (and error prone) to get
at them.

Case in point, the first link I sent out in the web
site update this morning should have been:

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#problem_worth_solving">http://www.nosdiet.com/#problem_worth_solving</a>

instead of #problem_work_solving

I guess I should stick in a table of contents with
links to the anchors to make it easier for people
(including myself) to get at these anchors. My one
reservation is that I think TOCs can scare people off.
But I'll figure out something. Thanks for raising the
issue.

Reinhard

&gt; &gt; You may want to check on that fish thing. They
&gt; have had reports here 
&gt; &gt; recently about the mercury in fish and how it is
&gt; not good for you. So
&gt; &gt; there are certain kinds you need to watch how much
&gt; you eat of.
&gt; 
&gt; The latest mercury issues was with Farmed Salmon
&gt; (what you usually get
&gt; in the store). Farmed atlantic salmon in particular
&gt; had high levels of
&gt; mercury. 
&gt; 
&gt; <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2004/01/08/salmon040108">http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2004/01/08/salmon040108</a>
&gt; 
&gt; Most ocean fish has some mercury in them. You should
&gt; be able to get a
&gt; listing of safe ammounts to eat from your
&gt; Government. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have also heard that peanut butter is good for
&gt; you specially for 
&gt; &gt; woman. Im going to try to start incorporating it
&gt; in my meals. And I 
&gt; &gt; think the s diet said no snacks unless it is a
&gt; piece of fruit. 
&gt; 
&gt; One of the nice things about the diet being up
&gt; online is that you can
&gt; go and check: 
&gt; 
&gt; <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com">http://www.nosdiet.com</a>
&gt; ========================================
&gt; What do you mean by &quot;snacks?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Snacks are &quot;when,&quot; not &quot;what.&quot; Pretzels with lunch
&gt; is lunch.
&gt; 
&gt; What about healthy snacks?
&gt; 
&gt; Eat healthy meals. If you know you have just three,
&gt; you'll make them
&gt; count. I'm perfectly aware that an orange between
&gt; meals is not going
&gt; kill you, that, taken in itself, it's perfectly
&gt; healthy. But the idea
&gt; is to have the orange instead of, not in addition
&gt; to, and in
&gt; justification of, some unhealthy part of your meal.
&gt; The problem is
&gt; primarily one of self-discipline, and if you start
&gt; making all kinds of
&gt; exceptions, you'll fail.
&gt; ==========================================
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard, have you ever thought of adding in Anchors
&gt; to each section
&gt; so they can be pointed to directly?
