&gt; Dear Deb,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the encouragement.
.....You are sure welcome! As Reinhard reminded us during the 
holidays, it's not the Holidays, it's the leftovers.... just don't 
drag those bingelike days into your future. Weight Watchers used to 
call this stuff &quot;Red Light&quot; foods... everyone has them and just 

start to identify that, obviously, chocolates are yours. Not 
uncommon I'm sure. At least you didn't bring home loads of 
chocolate and it was at a party... Don't feel too bad, you probably 
wouldn't have had them if they weren't there! Overcoming impulses 
to eat when food is in our face is a terrific challenge, and I just 
feel that the best strategy is to buy some good running shoes and 
say &quot;exit stage left&quot; then run like hell! By the time you are in a 

new scenario, the old impulse will have passed and you will be safe!
&gt; 
&gt; As for the song, I forget that I'm a dinosaur here.
.....What kind, triceratops? LOL :)

Hey Ginny, good music never ages, but no, I don't know Bob Merrill...
I actually have quite a love for music of all generations... I am 
crazy about Fats Waller, and in the fifties, let's see, of course 
Fats Domino, and all the great jazz balladeers, of course Sinatra 
etc... heh heh, I guess this little Deadhead has to listen to some 
Bob Merrill (he sounds very wholesome though, I'm not sure it's for 
me! LOL)
I'm going to be having a little date with a guy who is 8 years 
younger than me, and I am a bit of a throwback anyway... We were 
talking about the Beatles 40th anniversary last year of their first 
US visit and he said to me &quot;Oh yeah, my Dad actually has their first 

album Meet the Beatles, on *vinyl*!&quot; like this was some sort of 
ancient artifact unearthed from the mesopotamian era! I laughed 
because I have hardly any CDs and most of my music is on records! 
It's going to be fun to see what kind of other generation gap stuff 
is going to happen..
Hey at least he knows who John Coltraine is!

So for Valentines Day, everyone lets sing it together now,,,
&quot;Sugar,,, Honey honey,,, you are my candy girl,,,and you got me 
wanting you!!!!&quot; (sounds of Dogs howling in the background LOL )
Happy Valentines Day!
I think this should definitely be an S day
but perhaps we should try to keep our candy eating to under a pound 
eh? LOL :)
Love,
Debbie
