&gt;I'm no scientist but it sounds like the progression 
&gt; is tryptophan...5-HTP...serotonin...but it looks like any of those 

produce the same effect in the body. Still sounds like pretty good 
stuff...would you try again, with less?

...Nah, I already take St. Johns Wort and by only using 100mg of the 
5-HTP, it made me feel borderline comatose...so that's all folks :) 
It would be fine if I only felt that way just before falling asleep, 
but not only did I stay sleepy round the clock, I had some very 
bizarre dreams.
That's enough for me to say, it's not helping :)
Okay, my initial objective was to have less cravings for 
carbohydrates and feel more rested....I felt drugged not rested.
Interestingly enough, the day after I went &quot;cold turkey&quot; on the 
5-
HTP, I had a mini binge, the likes of which I haven't seen since 
prior to NoS...I feel it was caused by a bit of withdrawal...
My system is highly sensitive to introducing foreign substances, and 
if I don't feel it's helping me, my first feeling is always right, 
so I never use anything which gives me bad side effects...
Little walk down memory lane with Joolio (sup caffeine sister? are 
you drinking some right now! LOL)
This is the reason I stopped smoking pot once I was in my mid 
twenties. I developed that habit with my first boyfriend (a huge 
drug abuser, smoked pot whenever any responsibility presented 
itself...) Back then I was undiagnosed as bi-polar, and I did like 
the &quot;high&quot; but there were so many more bad effects...Once I was no 

longer with him (and we were together 9 years) I still had some old 
behaviors, but there was no one there encouraging me, through &quot;peer 

pressure&quot; to continue the behavior...I decided I hated the feeling 

of being high for 1/2 an hour, only to be followed by a huge 
depression which would last for maybe 5 hours or so... I remember it 
so clearly. I was counting the minutes that I would come &quot;out of it&quot; 

and feel &quot;normal&quot; again....I still had no clue about my manic 

depression, (that came about 10 years later) but I was starting to 
respect and listen to my body and make my own evaluations about 
whether something was good for me or not.
Sorry for the long bloggy tangent people :)
I feel great and rested today, my son let me sleep from 11:30 last 
night till 10:30 today!
I'm returning the 5-HTP for some more St. Johns Wort and this week I 
hope to have more slashes on my calendar :)
Love and Peace,
Debbie
