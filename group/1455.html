Rondelle (doo lang doo lang doo lang...)
Have you tried Melatonin/ If you do cut the tablet in 4's. For 
some reason a small dose works way better than a whole tablet...it 
is safe, and the dreams are vivid. 

Hey Bon, if my dreams got any more vivid night-time around here 
would be like a peyote trip, LOL
But that's only when I have something that is really bothering me.
And actually, melatonin, melanin etc...can be manufactured by our 
own bodies...I believe however, that even small amounts of light in 
the bedroom can inhibit this production...Some article in a health 
magazine read that even the light from a tabletop LED alarm clock 
could change the amount of melatonin released into the system. Oh 
time to take out my endocrinolgy notes again and look at them, at 
this point all I can really remember is the muscles and nerve 
pathways, bones...But endocrinology was cool...How do you make a 
hormone (ok bad joke)?

...it just that you are so interesting, he may get interested...

D...Thanks, I might just be the Siren that lures him onto the rocks!
He will be mine, ha ha ha ha1(evil siren laughter...) It's funny 
that you say this. I do have a irresistable effect on musicians (who 
have been married 4 times and have had 7 kids with 3 different 
wives, but I digress)
especially the ones who are tempermental (with a stress on the 
MENTAL part!) artistic types..You know the kind I mean!


Two good movies came out today, a
&gt; kiddie one called &quot;Home On The Range&quot;
D...How funny, I was just telling Richard that it looked like a good 
one :)

are &quot;Twisted &quot;and&quot; Taking Lives.&quot;

D...Been there, didn't do that..LOL

&gt; Is Urban Ranger a walking person? I often hear this in our group 
but was not positive. 

D...You are very positive! And yes it is walking (but with a Macho 
Reinhard name which makes walking more into a Lord Of the Rings 
fantasy past-time :)

&gt; Luv Yah,
&gt; Rondelle

D...You too :)
