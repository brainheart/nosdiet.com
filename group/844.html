-------Original Message-------

From: The Rev.
My Dr. told me eat either Bananas or oranges for blood pressure,
because of potassium, also low salt tomatoe juice or V8 also is loaded, 
but
listen to these words of wisdom from the Rev.....
Bonnie


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;BANANA A DAY
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;After Reading THIS, you'll NEVER look at the Banana in the same 
way
&gt; &gt; &gt;again!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Doctors - Home Remedy
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;If you want a quick fix for flagging energy levels there's no 
better
&gt; &gt; &gt;snack than a banana. Containing three natural sugars - sucrose,
&gt; &gt; fructose
&gt; &gt; &gt;and glucose - combined with fiber a banana gives an instant, 
sustained
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt;substantial boost of energy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for 
a
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;strenuous 90-minute workout. No wonder the banana is the number 
one
&gt; &gt; fruit
&gt; &gt; &gt;with the world's leading athletes. But energy isn't the only way 
a
&gt; &gt; banana
&gt; &gt; &gt;can help us keep fit. It can also help overcome or prevent 
a
&gt; &gt; substantial
&gt; &gt; &gt;number illnesses and conditions making it a must to add to our 
daily
&gt; &gt; diet.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Depression: According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND 
amongst
&gt; &gt; &gt;people suffering from depression, many felt much better after eating 
a
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;banana. This is because bananas contain trypotophan, a type of 
protein
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt;the body converts into serotonin known to make you relax, improve 
your
&gt; &gt; mood
&gt; &gt; &gt;and generally make you feel happier.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;PMS: Forget the pills - eat a banana. The vitamin B6 it contains
&gt; &gt; &gt;regulates blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anemia: High in iron, bananas can stimulate the production 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt;hemoglobin in the blood and so helps in cases of anemia.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Blood Pressure: This unique tropical fruit is extremely high 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt;potassium yet low in salt making it the perfect to beat blood
&gt; &gt; pressure. So
&gt; &gt; &gt;much so, the US Food and Drug Administration has just allowed 
the
&gt; &gt; banana
&gt; &gt; &gt;industry to make official claims for the fruit's ability to reduce 
the
&gt; &gt; risk
&gt; &gt; &gt;of blood pressure and stroke.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Brain Power: 200 students at a Twickenham (Middlesex) school 
were
&gt; &gt; &gt;helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at 
breakfast,
&gt; &gt; break,
&gt; &gt; &gt;and lunch in a bid to boost their brain power. Research has shown 
that
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;potassium packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils 
more
&gt; &gt; alert.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Constipation: High in fiber, including bananas in the diet can 
help
&gt; &gt; &gt;restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem 
without
&gt; &gt; &gt;resorting to laxatives!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hangovers: One of the quickest ways of curing a hangover is to make 
a
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;banana milkshake, sweetened with honey. The banana calms the 
stomach
&gt; &gt; and,
&gt; &gt; &gt;with the help of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar 
levels,
&gt; &gt; while
&gt; &gt; &gt;the milk soothes and re-hydrates your system.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Heart-burn: Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body so 
if
&gt; &gt; &gt;you suffer from heart-burn, try eating a banana for soothing 
relief.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Morning Sickness: Snacking on bananas between meals helps to 
keep
&gt; &gt; &gt;blood sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Mosquito bites: Before reaching for the insect bite cream, try 
rubbing
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. Many people 
find
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt;amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Nerves: Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the 
nervous
&gt; &gt; &gt;system.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Overweight and at work? Studies at the Institute of Psychology 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt;Austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food 
like
&gt; &gt; &gt;chocolate. Looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found 
the
&gt; &gt; most
&gt; &gt; &gt;obese were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. The report
&gt; &gt; concluded
&gt; &gt; &gt;that, to avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to control 
our
&gt; &gt; blood
&gt; &gt; &gt;sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two hours 
to
&gt; &gt; keep
&gt; &gt; &gt;levels steady.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Ulcers: The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal
&gt; &gt; &gt;disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness. It is the 
only
&gt; &gt; raw
&gt; &gt; &gt;fruit that can be eaten without distress in over-chronic ulcer 
cases.
&gt; &gt; It
&gt; &gt; &gt;also neutralizes over-acidity and reduces irritation by coating 
the
&gt; &gt; lining
&gt; &gt; &gt;of the stomach.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Temperature control: Many other cultures see bananas as a 
'cooling'
&gt; &gt; &gt;fruit that can lower both the physical and emotional temperature 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt;expectant mothers. In Thailand, for example, pregnant women 
eat
&gt; &gt; bananas to
&gt; &gt; &gt;ensure their baby is born with acool temperature.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Bananas can help SAD sufferers
&gt; &gt; &gt;because they contain the natural mood enhancer, trypotophan.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Smoking: Bananas can also help people trying to give up smoking. 
The
&gt; &gt; &gt;B6, B12 they contain, as well as the potassium and magnesium found 
in
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;them, help the body recover from the effects of nicotine 
withdrawal.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Stress: Potassium is a vital mineral, which helps normalize 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt;heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body's
&gt; &gt; &gt;water-balance. When we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, 
there
&gt; &gt; by
&gt; &gt; &gt;reducing our potassium levels. These can be rebalanced with the 
help
&gt; &gt; of a
&gt; &gt; &gt;high-potassium banana snack.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Strokes: According to research in 'The New England Journal 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt;Medicine' ,eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the 
risk
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt;death by strokes by as much as 40%!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Warts: Those keen on natural alternatives swear that, if you want 
to
&gt; &gt; &gt;kill off a wart, take a piece of banana skin and place it on the 
wart,
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt;the yellow side out. Carefully hold the skin in place with a 
plaster
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt;surgical tape!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;So you see, a banana really is a natural remedy for many 
ills.
&gt; &gt; &gt;When you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, 
twice
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin 
A
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt;iron, and twice the other vitamins and minerals. It is also rich 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt;potassium and is one of the best value foods around. So maybe 
it's
&gt; &gt; time to
&gt; &gt; &gt;change that well-known phrase so that we say:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;A Banana a day keeps the doctor away&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;
