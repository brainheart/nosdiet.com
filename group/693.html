 Dear Joy,
I also read about the apples and peanut butter. And I lived in
Switzerland many years. We used to follow no S back then and were slim. 
Lots
of exercise, so snacks, no seconds, and hardly ever had sweets, except 
for
an occasional piece of Suisse chocolate! Bonnie

I think it's ricotta cheese. I used to eat quark when I lived in Germany,
and it was similar to ricotta cheese.

I am also eating the 3 apple a day plan, but eat an apple a half hour before
my meals. I consider it an appetizer - part of the meal. Also, I'm
planning for afternoon and morning snack (oops - is that maybe allowing one 

s&quot; in my diet) of celery sticks with peanut butter. I read that adding
peanut butter to your diet will help you lose weight faster because it
builds up your metabolism and helps you build muscle. Maybe it could also
be added to a dinner or lunch meal menu.

I just figure...whatever will work for me, I'm gonna try it. Also, I'm
trying to eat fish at least 2-3 times a week in place of meat for a dinner
meal. Don't know if I can deal with that or not...we'll see. They say if
you substitute fish for red meat once a week, you will lose weight too.

I plan to start walking a mile every morning as soon as the weather is
fitting...and build it up to 4 miles in an hour before summer is over.
