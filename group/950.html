Congratulations Reinhard! Babies count wherever they happen to be! 
Allan I think you're right about the fences. I was so strict for a week or 

two and had results on nos. Then I began making little exceptions and have 

been basically off for a few weeks with dreadful results! I have this habit of 

rewarding myself with little snacks usually sweet. I caught myself tonight (as 

I was preparing supper!). I have decided no supper -- technically I have 

already had it. But that means no more snacks either. I am going to make a 

conscious effort to come up with other rewards; they have to be quick and not take 

too much time. Maybe a walk, a swim, the problem with these is that they can't 

be combined with something else i need to do. I certainly see why smoking 

could help people not eat so much. Maybe working harder to make meals more 

pleasurable and not the chore they often are after a tiring day would be the thing 

to do. That requires planning!
Diane, I admire your resolve to quit the diet merry-go-round especially as I 

found myself looking up diet remedies last night. Hard to believe that 

something as simple as a habit could cause all this grief! Anyway, I am starting 

over on nos without any &quot;supplements&quot; after reading your message. Good 
wishes for 
success to all the new, the re-news, and the courageous who have kept at it! 

Sophie
