Jennifer, Rebelcat9,

I'm happy to hear that by your various metrics (scale,
boyfriend comments) you're seeing results. Comments
may be mushy and unscientific, but they really are the
most valuable metric -- nothing will sustain you in
your efforts better. 

That being said, all this scale talk has made me pay
attention to my own weight a little more recently. The
173 I had at my physical seems to have been a post
holiday high: I rarely hit 170 these days. Looks like
I'm going to have to revise my total loss from 35 to
40. 

Still, I'll stick with my moral: don't look at the
scale too much. If I had, over the last two years, I
wouldn't have such nice numbers to report today. It
makes you think in small, micro terms about a macro
problem. Every now and then, sure, make sure you're
not way off base, but not every day. 

Congratulations, both, again, and sorry to use your
good news as an excuse to preach,

Reinhard

&gt; Hey everybody. I hardly ever post but I read your
&gt; stuff daily.
&gt; I've been trying to get this right for several
&gt; weeks, and it's 
&gt; starting to pay off. No seconds was the hardest for
&gt; me to conquer. 
&gt; Snacks have never been that big of an issue, and
&gt; allowing myself to 
&gt; have goodies on the weekend is actually an added
&gt; treat. I can enjoy 
&gt; the food that I eat without beating myself up about
&gt; how many 
&gt; calories, carbs, fat grams etc,etc,etc. I can just
&gt; enjoy my meal and 
&gt; move on. Seeing some looser clothes, scared of the
&gt; scale so I don't 
&gt; know about pounds. My boyfriend told me yesterday
&gt; he thought I had 
&gt; lost some weight. He said my face looks thinner,
&gt; and he was kind of 
&gt; looking me over. I like that! So thanks for all
&gt; the info and all 
&gt; the support, it's working and what i love is that i
&gt; can enjoy food 
&gt; again.
