Thanks CeCe. And congratulations on your wedding this summer! My 
husband and I just celebrated our eighth anniversary. Amazing how 
fast it went! 

You know, I also noticed how I'm not that hungry between meals, and 
I think it's because the QUALITY of my meals are better now that I 
know I won't be eating for another four hours or so. I now take 
time to prepare and really think about what I'm eating(although I 
have increased the quantity just a bit also). haha

It's just nice to know that there are others who are doing this with 
me and I am especially grateful that my husband decided to do it 
too. He's great and I want him around for a while! :) ---Maria

&gt; Congrats on having a great week! I've been doing this a week too 
and I've 
&gt; been loving it. I only had one slip up (on any other diet I 
wouldn't have 
&gt; lasted 2 days). What's surprising is that I don't feel that 
hungry in between 
&gt; meals even though I'm not eating that much.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck!
&gt; 
&gt; CeCe
