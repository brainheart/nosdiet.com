HI! I'm not too scared to post :c)
However great this info looks, I fear I MUST stop my coffee and my 
wine! :c( It's the last frontier as it seems my new exercising (I 
started weights very minimally and only a few days ago) with the 
treadmill I've been doing for 2 weeks and doing NoS for a week now... 
my jeans still fit tight. Combined with going to a fat % calculator 
site and seeing what % of fat my body is - it amazed me and made me 
want to shoot myself in the head!! I have been trying and it's done 
nothing so far and I hit rock bottom for a couple of hours last 
night. I couldn't even choke down my glass of wine :c( I dug out my 
pecan pie and 2 forks (one for DH) and CHEATED!!! I'm so evil1! :c) 
But I feel better now and I'm ready to exercise even more before I 
start to give up foods and drinks I love so much... It must not be 
enough or good exercise if it's still not making a difference...
Oops - I rambled again... and went off on a self pity rant....
I want to say that I would be very happy losing 15 pounds - I would 
be about a size 8 which I really should be happy with. I know it 
could be much worse... BUT I had 39% body fat and I think that was 
cheating a few cm in my measurements.... OMGosh!! That is NOT OK!!! 
SO - don't go to one of these sites if you want to feel OK about 
yourself. They will not do it!! :c)
And I will stick with my wine and try to up my exercise.... for 
now... and I'm not quitting NoS. I just had a momentary set back 
where only a cheat would perk me up... sorry :c)

&gt; &quot;Glass ceiling,&quot; as you may remember, is my cute,
&gt; punny two drink a day limit for alcoholic drinks (one
&gt; is better for women, go figure). It's not strictly
&gt; no-s, but drink related questions pop up a lot here so
&gt; I thought I'd post a link to this nytimes article.

&gt; 
&gt; Some highlights:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; Not only red wine but also white wine, beer and hard
&gt; liquor appear to protect against mental decline in
&gt; older women, two new studies have found.
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; Women who consumed about a drink a day (up to 15 grams
&gt; of alcohol, or about half an ounce), the researchers
&gt; found, had significantly better test results - so much
&gt; so that in their mental performance, they scored about
&gt; a year and a half younger than the nondrinkers and
&gt; those who drank 15 to 30 grams a day.
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; While most doctors have held that suggesting alcohol
&gt; as part of a healthy diet is too dangerous, Dr.
&gt; Stampfer thinks this approach should be re-evaluated.
&gt; &quot;The evidence for its health benefits, both for
&gt; cognitive function and heart disease prevention, is
&gt; too strong to ignore,&quot; he said.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The big challenge,&quot; he concluded, &quot;is to make the
&gt; recommendation in the right way.&quot;
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; I think &quot;glass ceiling&quot; sounds about right...

&gt; P.S. You can start posting again. Didn't mean to scare
&gt; you all into silence!
