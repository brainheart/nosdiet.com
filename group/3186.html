&gt; And Deb is a friend in deed! Thank you for the pep talk....I was 
down to 153 early this week as I was walking and no Essing,
....You are welcome, anytime :)
And may I say, that I would KILL to be where you are now!!! It will 
happen :) Bon, you too are a terrific friend and I like that you 
always keep it real!
I think lots of time when I go off on a NoS rant, and get all 
vehement, it is because, I too, like to give my own self a pep 
talk...
My problem last night was not ice cream, or snacks, but plain old 
revolting gluttony (modern interpretations/euphamism=Seconds...)

I feel like Debor Samsa today... A major roach!
I metamorphosed yesterday back to my old Seconds habit..
For the past, hmmm, about 7 weeks, I think, the flu we had kept my 
appetite to a serious minimum, and pretty much not alot of foods 
appealed to me... Well now food tastes good again and unfortunately, 
my old Seconds habit, was trying to dupe me into thinking &quot;it's okay 

to have seconds&quot; what a jerk that voice is! I ate like a maniac 
last night.. The funny thing about this is that last year at this 
time, I would eat like this all the time... How my body hates the 
after effect it has on me now... I ate a huge portion of Chinese 
food, then ate from the container, then oh my God, how embarrassing 
this is to admit, I then two hours later, had an entire steak!
And then,,,,, I ate the leftovers at 9:45 pm just before bed...
The food is still in my gut now as I write, and I woke up feeling as 
friendly as Rasputin... I feel like puking! (can I say puke on NoS? 
LOL...)
Guess what? This is actually a great thing... it just means that I 
have changed for the better, but I need to develop some super 
strategy to outsmart those nasty, sneaky, old bad habits...
Hmmm maybe it's time for some hypnosis? LOL....
Help Reinhard... Please create some super strength Mantras to hold 
those nasty habits at bay..
Ultimately, I never want to have to have them keep popping up...
My rational self knows better now.. You would think that I wouldn't 
repeat unpleasant experiences such as last night, but obviously, 
those old &quot;voices&quot; are still in my head (voices=bad habits)
Maybe I need to come up with some fantasy name for my seconds 
habit... Anybody creative out there with a good &quot;Arch Enemy&quot; name 

for the saboteur still in me,,, Seconds?... It would help if it was 
really potent and maybe funny! Then I can employ that image for 
extra help, since looking at food can seem so innocuous when you are 
consuming it, but if you are overeating, the reality is just not 
innocuous at all... Yeah, seconds (nay even thirds)used to be my 
worst one, and still is... Bah!

Sweets and snacks seem well under control though..
It's weird.
Hope you all have a great Springy weekend!
Peace and Love
But War against old Habits
:) Debbie

PS... Wondering if anyone else exists out there these days! LOL
Any Newbies.
