Hi, 
Like I had told you before every Monday I'm suppose to go to this club called TOPS 
(Take Off Pounds Sensibly) Well sometimes if I do bad during the week and am pretty 
sure I have gained weight I think of some reason not to go. We all do it. I have done 
pretty good this week except I slipped up today and had some coke. I'm really trying 
to give up soda all together. But you would think I could have waited until tomorrow. 
I heard someone say that soda is like candy in a bottle or can. Well anyway please 
keep emailing I can always use the encouragement. Oh by the way I did start my 
exercising back up.

I thought I was the only one who hides when I am ashamed of myself.
My eating habits for the last two weeks definatly have not been
regulatin Nos. On the plus side I have been walking everyday. I just
hope they are canceling each other out. I don't dare step on a scale
to find out.
