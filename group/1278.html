Hi all -

I'm writing to ask all of you to put on your thinking caps and help me 
with
a worthy project. I have checked with Reinhard first about this and he 
has
approved the idea.

Recently someone requested No S Diet &quot;stuff&quot; like mugs, T-shirts, 
etc.
Reinhard said he had wanted to do something like that but it wasn't really
his thing...but he hoped to get to it soon. I'm semi-creative and
semi-skilled (self-taught) in computer graphics, and I've been mulling 
over
some ideas ever since then. I know that Cafe Press will put anything on 
a
T-shirt, mug, mousepad or what-have-you if you simply upload your graphics
and tell them who to donate the (small) commission to. (See
<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/">http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/</a>) 
The money could help support the No S
website, and we'd all feel better about paying top dollar for a coffee 
mug.
(If anyone knows of a similar site that's better, please share.)

I'm hoping that if this is a good idea, you'll help me think of a few
designs that I can play with. And by the way, if any of you is really good
at this kind of thing or will get it done sooner than I will, please
volunteer! My goal would be maybe three designs available through Cafe
Press within a month. I might not know what I'm promising, but I do hope 
to
&quot;keep it simple.&quot;

When I say &quot;designs,&quot; I'm imagining some provocative text, or catchy 
motto,
or a good quote like the one about habits I shared recently, coupled with
the No S logo (or maybe a new variation?), which would pique people's
interest if they see it on our T-shirt, or inspire us as we sit at our 
desks
wishing for a snack (but not really), virtuously sipping tea and
contemplating the mug.

I've thought of a few starter-ideas but as I said, I'm only SEMI-creative
and I feel the best method is to ask this big group, and pool the creativity
of many to come up with something really good.

And once again, if anyone else wants to volunteer instead, speak up! My
life is busy enough already and I'll be happy just to buy what you create!
=)

Diane

That quote again was...
--------------------------
&quot;Habit is either the best of servants or the worst of masters.&quot;
- Nathaniel Emmons
--------------------------
Is it catchy enough for the front of a T-shirt, with the NoS Diet logo 
on
the back? Opinions needed.
