HI Ginny
That is what I did all of July, grazed! I think the hair in my nose had
icicles on them for having my head stuck in the fridge so much.
What I love this time of the year is peaches, nectarines and plums and I 
sub
them for a meal. And I shouldn't!

Thom and all:

I, too, recently joined this group and like you I had
weight loss surgery and am 45. I lost 130 pounds from
a high of a little over 350. I didn't lost it all
either.

I still want to lose 40-60 pounds (depending upon
muscle mass - I am 5'9&quot; with a current lean body
weight of 170) - the BMI is a bogus measure - IMHO,
body fat is a better indicator of true level of
overweight.

Anyway, back off the soap box...

I just want to learn to eat like a normal human being.
I have Polycysitc Ovarian Syndrome, which doesn't
help matters. I really need to give up all sugars and
refined carbs - thus the appeal of Reinhard's simple
plan.

I am truly addicted to sugar - bad stuff, indeed. So
here we all are just doing our best to be healthy.

So, Thom, I feel your pain and can sympathize with the
pouch situation. Still, using this plan, we can eat 5
smaller healthy meals. No grazing - that'll really do
a WLS paitent in. I found that out the hard way
(gained 10).

Hang in there.

&gt; Hi, my name is Thom, I am 45 years old and I live in
&gt; Jacksonville, Florida.
&gt; I heard about this diet from a friend of mine. I
&gt; believe I have tried
&gt; nearly every diet known to man over the years. I
&gt; even had RNY bypass
&gt; surgery back in 2001. At my worst, I weighed 400+
&gt; pounds. After surgery I
&gt; lost 155 pounds. I have since regained 15 pounds. 
&gt; My biggest problem is
&gt; snacking. I do snack on sweets, so I guess I
&gt; struggle with two of the S's.
&gt; Since I've had bypass surgery, seconds is not a
&gt; problem. I typically, do
&gt; have seconds or thirds, but that's because I always
&gt; take really small
&gt; portions. I don't know how much I will tolerate at
&gt; any given time.
&gt; Sometimes, I can only eat half a burger and a few
&gt; fries. Other times I can
&gt; eat a full burger, fries and a salad. Never can I
&gt; eat more than the normal
&gt; person would consider a full plate.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I do have a problem with overly sweet, overly greasy
&gt; or high carb foods.
&gt; That is a result of the surgery. It is a by product
&gt; that helps you lose
&gt; weight. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My goal is to lose another 60 pounds. I've been
&gt; walking about a mile a day.
&gt; I am struggling with the no snacking rule. Having
&gt; said that, it is easier to
&gt; deal wit when I know it's only for a few days and
&gt; then I get a break.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Enough ramblings, that's my story thanks for
&gt; listening.
