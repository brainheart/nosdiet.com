Hi friends -

I need to go &quot;No Mail&quot; for a while so I can concentrate on some important 

projects. Even skimming and deleting is taking more time than I can spare 

now--especially because too often I must chime in as well! =) (This seems 

to happen with every YahooGroup I join!) It probably isn't necessary to 

make this announcement, but on the slight chance someone were to ask me 

something later, I thought it better to let you know I'm not here. =)

I will keep on NoS-ing and try to check in every week or so at the website 

to see what's happening...so don't worry, I'm not quitting just when I got a 

good start. If--no, when--I start needing smaller clothes, I'll let you 

know!

As a parting gift, I'll share a small inspiration which some of you may 

enjoy. I recently read &quot;No More Words&quot; by Reeve Lindbergh, and in it she 

quotes some of her mother's writings, including the following poem:

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Success

I lit the candles in my heart
And opened wide the door.
&quot;And are you she they call 'Success'?
Have we not met before?&quot;

&quot;It seems...but no...could I forget
Beauty so like a star?
Come, here is bread and here is wine
For you have travelled far.&quot;

&quot;Child, I have been here every day.
You would not turn or rise
But called me 'Failure,' seeing me
Through tears within your eyes.&quot;

--Anne Morrow, class of 1924, &quot;The Wheel&quot;
Miss Chapin's School, March 1924

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

I'm very picky about my poetry, but this one passed!

Diane
