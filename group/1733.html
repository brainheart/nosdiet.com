Mush,
Sound advise. I to find that many times I'm eating too little to
make noS work properly with just the 3 meals. Before noS I could eat
next to nothing all day because I would more than make up for it at
dinner and before bed. Trouble is I must have nailed 3,000 to 5,000
calories on those days.
On noS I find the need to have reasonably sized meals or my body is
yelling at me by 7:00 P.M. The weeks when the calories are about the
same for each meal my weight goes down. Other times if I'm not so
careful there may be very little loss of even gain, my ability to resist
a snack or one of my wife's home made cookies is almost non-existent.
&quot;S days should be S days so N days aren't.&quot; When meal size is
right, you'll make it through the night. 
Peace and Love, David H. (am I channeling Deb?)

Don't worry Julie. You need to make sure you have efficient amount 
of food each meal. Fill your plate especially in the beginning until 
you get used to the system. It took me about 6 months to finally get 
the hang of it because I was worrying too much about how much was on 
my plate and what it was.

I have lost 4 lbs and I am only weighing myself once a month. I was 
kind of obsessive before about the scale. It is a slow process 
changing years of bad habits.

S days should be S days so N days aren't.
