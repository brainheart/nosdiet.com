&gt; please don't post 5 posts in an hour, etc. It's a little 
overwhelming.
....Not a good thing, sorry :(
&gt; People feel smothered.
......Definitely not desired effect, again oops :(
I don't want to stifle anyone's
&gt; enthusiasm, a lot of these machine gunned posts are
&gt; wonderful and the group would be poorer without them,
&gt; but if those who are tempted to do so could just
&gt; reorganize them a little so it's maybe one big post
&gt; instead of 8 little ones, people could deal with it
&gt; better. Let's be snipping snipers, not machine
&gt; gunners.
....Organization was never my strong suit, but I guess it's worth 
working on :)
I will try my hardest Reinhard and sorry group, as I know that it's 
me who is the &quot;machine gunner!&quot; LOL....
Yes, this is part of my disorder, and it seems that my posting has 
begun to be a full time job, which isn't so great because theres no 
money in it!
I don't know how easy one letter would be? How about 2? LOL

&gt; used nosdiet_chat yahoo group is a better forum.

.....I'd certainly go there if anyone was on it. But it would take 
a little experimenting because I've never used chat before :) 
However, it seems no one has used it since June! :)
I forgot that most people don't use this system like I do...I don't 
get email or digest, I just check the messages whenever I want...But 
yeah, if I was getting it in digest I too, would be overwhelmed by 
the huge amount of blah blah blah, from me! LOL So apologies to the 
digest people and maybe the chat thing will work out :)
I will try to hit the target now and transform into a &quot;Sniper&quot;, so 

watch out!
Mainly, I want to be a classy bitch with a sh*&amp;load of etiquitte :)

So, Reinhard, point taken and *much* respect and continued love and 
admiration to you and my friends at NOS...
Have a great day all you guys, see you tomorrow :)
Love and Peace,
&quot;Machine gun&quot; Debbie

&gt; Many smiley faces and no offense,
&gt; Reinhard
....Et tu Brute :)
