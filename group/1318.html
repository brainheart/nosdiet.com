Hey Jen, nice to read your posts today : )
- Wow, who would have believed it if they were told it does really 
feel ok to be hungry,and hear that ol' stomach talking to you?
I congratulate you on thinking of that as a healthy change :)
I think that's how &quot;normal&quot; peoples stomachs are, empty sometimes!
I have been rumbling around these last few days too, and I am also 
flabbergasted at how long it has been that I have actually let my 
stomach be empty for any part of the day...It is a triumph to be sure.
A trick that I have been using before I sit down and eat, especially 
when I feel stressed, to keep me from pulverizing what is on my plate 
in 2 minutes is this
First I say a thank you prayer (always have done that)
Heres the trick...
I close my eyes, I give myself a face and jaw massage, including 
really smoothing out the areas around the eyes, and rubbing down the 
cheek to the mouth. This only takes about 1 minute, but the end 
result is really great!...It helps me destress before I take my first 
bite, and all the while, I am smelling the nice food, wafting up, and 
imagining how that will taste before I pick up my fork or spoon. The 
massage helps reduce the tension all through my body and when I start 
to chew my food my face is already relaxed and I am not just a revved 
up chewing machine...I think chewing is one of the ways we release 
tension which has built up in our day, so often the jaw gets really 
tense...It is my personal theory too that we chew too fast because of 
built up jaw tension, looking unconsciously to release that stress.
So you still haven't told me what your favorite fragrant flower is : )
Peace,
Deb

&gt; Hi Rich
&gt; 
&gt; I really enjoy your posts.
&gt; 
&gt; Your teeth experience sounds seriously scary. Three 'esses' I'm 
sure you
&gt; could have done without. I hope it has settled down now.
&gt; 
&gt; I still enjoy the food just as much
&gt; without that extra bit: I still spend just as long eating it, and
&gt; I still feel full at the end (where before I'd probably have felt
&gt; overfull), and it still tastes the same.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That's great. I think it has lots of benefits - as you will see 
from my post
&gt; to Deb, esp re the digestion.
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing I thought of too is about the time it takes the 
stomach to
&gt; get the message to the brain re fullness. Eating slower will give a 

chance
&gt; for that to happen.
&gt; 
&gt; What you say also makes me think about why I need to eat: part is 

flavour,
&gt; part is needing to be full (which is why I eat quickly sometimes) - 

to fill
&gt; that empty feeling that has nothing to do with hunger, part is 
habit.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the things I have enjoyed this last week (when I was No 
Sing - and it
&gt; hasn't all been successful) was feeling hungry - real hunger, and 

going with
&gt; it until it was time to eat, or I had time to eat.
&gt; 
&gt; All the very best
&gt; 
&gt; Jen
&gt;
