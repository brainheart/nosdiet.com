well having worked all my life and raised 3 kids i always spent my evenings with my 
kids as i felt guilty for working now they are old enough they have other things to 
do but i never got out of the habit of being home for them 
i also live in a very rural area so there is not much to do . mostly i read books or 
watch tv both of which cause snacking :)

Hi Cat

The hard thing about this group is that we really don't know how each 
other's lives work. What appeals to me to pass my evenings won't 
necessarily appeal to you and may not even be possible for you - all I 

can suggest is that you find things to do in the evening that really 
absorb you, so much so that you realise it's time for bed without having 

thought about food since you ate. This will take a conscious effort but 

you already know that you're capable of that!
