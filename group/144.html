Tammy,
If you can, get up and exercise before the day care kids start arriving. 
I
know that is usually a pretty early start but its a great way to start 
the
day. Start out by getting up just 15 or 20 minutes earlier than you
normally do so it doesn't feel like such a shock to your routine. As you
get used to it, you can get up earlier and get a bit more done.

I have 6 kids of my own ages 2 to 11 that I homeschool. I also watch 3
3-year-olds so it is quite a house full. I absolutely enjoy it but the 
only
way to make sure my exercise routine gets in every day is to get up at 
5:00.

I often feel like I am tired and would rather sleep in but I get up anyway
and put on my exercise clothes right away (which for me is a bikini because
I just get too hot otherwise). I know I am not going to walk around in 
a
bikini all day and I'm certainly not answering the door to let the day 
care
kids in with it on. So, I either have to start my exercising or go change.
By that time I'm feeling awake and ready to go.

I start out with a 12 minute ab tape by Joannie Greggains that is easy 
to
start with when you are a bit tired. Then I use my free weights to exercise
2 muscle groups. After that I hop on the treadmill and watch a video tape
of some show that I would love to watch during the day or evening but don't
have time to. That helps me pass the time as I'm walking/running. I get 
to
indulge in a great show and get my walking done at the same time.

I have a pretty set routine but some people prefer to switch it up every 
day
by jogging one day and doing aerobics the next day and resistance training
the next day. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you are doing
something. You could even turn your house work into an exercise routine 
if
you want.

I know you can do it. I know it can get really crazy and completely
unpredictable with all the kids. But, it is possible to do. Good luck! 
Let
us know how it works out.

Lynda

HI,
I think it is great you lost so much weight, but I was wondering do you
exercise to and if so how much. I have a in home daycare and I have 6kids
the oldest 3 and I really have to keep my eyes on them all the time, so 
I
dont get to ex. everday. I guess I'm feeling like I will never lose this
weight.




Thanks for listening.Tammy

I'm looking at this as a permanent way to eat. It feels balanced and
sensible to me. I've been following it since late july and I've lost about
15 or 20 pounds, that's one trousers size. Its the first time I've worn 
size
36 jeans, comfortably, in years. Not bad, eh?
