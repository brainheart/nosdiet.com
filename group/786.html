Good luck, and keep us posted, &quot;

[and helen said] 

Well my first day I flubbed

I slept in leaving me with no packed lunch for work I work in a convenience store 
Yeah I had junk today but I did not snack! I made the things into meals.

Egg and cheese english muffin( though highly processed) Coffee and a special K bar 
for breakfast

Hotdog baked lays and diet soda for lunch

Kept myself to two large coffees at work today

Switched to half and half cream from heavy.. and have stopped adding the flavour 
shots to them since they are full of syrops and sugars.

The sugar replacement we have at work is sweet and low.. and I really do not like 
it.. so I will look for a box of splenda singles that way I can toss a few in my 
purse. Tea at work sucks.. when I make tea at home I only put a half a teaspoon in a 
cup anyhow.. so I will drink only tea at home now.. to avoid that double/double 
trap.

Dinner was not great either.( not my night to cook ) Bbq'd burgers.. 

At least I know they were made with lean meat and they were grilled instead of 
fried.. 

And I am full

Sorry for the run on sentences.. I can barely think.. I am so tired from today at 
work.

I still have to get in my walk tonight( even though I run around like a mad woman for 
8 hours in the store)



Oh and I do drink water.. 

I make myself have a 710 ml water before I ingest anything else in a day. Three 
bottles like that in a day are like getting 8 8 oz glasses.

I can usually only manage two though.. I really am a hot drink junkie.. it took me 
the better part of the afternoon to finish my diet coke from lunch. I eventually 
dumped it feeling it was turning into a snack/grazing sort of thing.
