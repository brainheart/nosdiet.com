I only weigh myself on a weekly basis. I find it is way too easy to
sabotage myself if I weigh myself more than that. If weighing
yourself is a problem, don't. If you are sticking to the rules,
making healthier choices and moving more, I am convinced the weight
will come off as your body starts to realize there is not an impending
famine. I have always felt fat. I have always had what I guess you
would call a love hate relationship with my body. I have always hated
being overweight but I love my body enough I was not willing to risk
my health on a fad diet. So whenever they talked about weight issues
in health class I listened. I even went so far as to sign up for a
full year of weight training and aerobics for my P.E. elective my
sophmore year in highschool.(The only time in my life I was actually
beginning to feel comfortable in my skin.)I have tried Richard
Simmons, Susan Powter. I bought a Kathy Ireland aerobics tape. At the
time I found NoS I was seriously thinking of joining my MIL in her
doctor ordered South Beach Diet. After reading the book I realized I
probably wouldn't be able to sustain the diet and feed my family too.
NoS made sense to me. I have said it before and I will say it again,
I don't care how long it takes to get this weight off,as long as it
comes of and stays off. Things I have found very helpful. The
magazine &quot;Light and Tasty&quot; is a great magizine full of recipes
complete with the food counts. It makes it a lot easier to make
healthier choices, and on my S days I can indulge in a healthier
version of my favorites by trying one of their yummy dessert or
snackfood recipes. Going for walks with my kids. An most importantly
not obsessing about how much weight I am losing or gaining on a day to
day basis. Your friend in health Melanie
