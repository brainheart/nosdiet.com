&gt;=20
&gt;=20=20
&gt;=20
&gt; I did weigh myself this morning and gained ONLY 5 pounds on the=20
cruise =96 this included 3 days in New Orleans and 5 days on the=20
ship. I ate and drank practically around the clock =96 so 5 pounds is=20
a blessing.=20
....You know it Mary! I wonder if my recent post about Beignets and=20
NOLA food had anything to do with your new post... I lived down=20
there for 2 and a half years and like I said before, theres a reason=20
why they call it the &quot;Big&quot; easy...Everyone is fat, well certainly=20
more than average...When they make vegetables down there, it is even=20
the norm to add bacon grease to add flavor (it does, but at what=20
cost? LOL) One time I tried to order a broiled platter of seafood,=20
instead of deep fried and battered, I got a look from the waiter=20
like I was walking around with three heads!

I know the pounds will not fall off like they did with Scarsdale,=20
but I also know that I am giving up all the mind games I had to play=20
to stick with diets in the past.=20=20
&gt;=20
....Yeah, you don't want to be on Scarsdale! Look at what happened=20
to Herman! (sorry, just kidding :)=20=20
&gt;=20
&gt; I am hoping to post here often and will let you know how my first=20
days go. I am going to use the RED SLASH method of marking off my=20
calendar to measure my success.

....I'm with you on that...How was your first few hours! :)
Peace and Love,
Deb
