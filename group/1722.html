Too much willpower leads to obsession or anorexia. I have an anorexic niece,
over 6 feet tall and wearing British dress size 8 US size 6 I think that 
is.
I don't think that's good. I called in to visit my brother,her father and
when I had a cup of coffee, she told me that I should change my brand of
artificial sweeteners the one I use has 1 calorie per pill. Some time ago
she questioned why I was eating rice cakes with a non starvation topping 
and
found it difficult to take in that I simply like rice cakes, so what if 
it
was buttered?

&gt; &gt; I believe that Willpower basically is the Force that allows us 
to
achieve
&gt; &gt; our Destiny and is extremely important, however discipline is 
more
&gt; &gt; reliable and you need both.
&gt;
&gt; Hmm! Well, my statement was just based on a different definition of
&gt; willpower. In a dieting context, &quot;willpower&quot; has always been the 
word
used
&gt; to describe one's ability to say NO to every food that ISN'T on THE 
DIET,
&gt; for a period of hours, days, weeks or months...however long one can
continue
&gt; holding on and denying one's desires. If your willpower is strong or 
your
&gt; desires are weak, any diet may work. However, most of us with a weight
&gt; problem haven't been helped by diets because they depend mainly on
willpower
&gt; and willpower is like walking a tightrope. One quote that has stuck in 
my
&gt; head for years: &quot;Willpower is sitting in an ice cream parlor with 
your
&gt; friends, drinking black coffee while everyone else eats ice cream.
&gt; Discipline is have a small dish of ice cream and later eating less 
or
doing
&gt; a bit more exercise to balance out the effect of the ice cream.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; A bit less exotic than Eastern Philosophy 101, but that is my
understanding.
&gt; =)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;....That is going on the assumption that we are dealing with a 
rational
&gt; &gt;person...And as exaggerated as this sounds my mom will
&gt; never &quot;approve&quot; of anything common sense from me and in general tries 
to
&gt; keep me as miserable as she is..This is the kind of &quot;love&quot; she got as 
a
kid,
&gt; and she knows no other brand...
&gt;
&gt; So sorry to hear about that! I do believe you, because I've known 
people
&gt; like this--but fortunately I'm not related to any of them. I think I 
was
&gt; assuming that your mom was more or less similar to my mom or perhaps 
my
&gt; grandmothers. Oops, wrong assumption! Well, don't give up, and
&gt; (unsolicited advice) do try pitying her when all else fails. I've
&gt; discovered that helps with some truly impossible people! =)
