Hello;

Since it has been so quiet I guess it's a good time for me to start babbling 
uninterrupted.

I started at the beginning of the year and I still think nos is the best thing since 
they 
invented sliced bread, I mean celery. Wow, I must have lost tons! How many pounds in 
two 
and a half months!?

Uh, not much. Up until last week maybe 5 or 6 pounds, but according to the scale this 

morning, maybe 2 or 3. That doesn't sound too impressive. The point is I don't 
care.

I follow nos strictly. Reinhard is right about the fence thing - use it on this diet, 
and use it 
everywhere else in life. It makes decisions much more clear, and right. 


I look forward to weekends but when they are over I always look back and notice that 
I 
probably didn't eat much more than the weekdays. I'm too busy doing weekend 
stuff.

I work out lightly most weekday mornings, using bodyweight exercises and some 
weights. 
Three times a week I work out aerobicly, often bordering on anaerobicly for short 
spurts. I 
do a variation of shovelglove several times a week - I dig out the basement, pot 
plants, 
widen the driveway embankment. That is combined with some wheelbarrowglove.

Here's what I'm happy about, and makes me not care about the pound count. I'm saving 
a 
whole bunch of money on (not my auto insurance) snack foods. I used to buy big 
supplies 
of nuts and fruits for snacking at work. I figure I must be saving at least 10 - 15 
bucks a 
week. That ain't peanuts for me 'cause I'm a schoolteacher.

Here is another reason: I don't waste time using my hands to stuff stuff down my 
mouth. I 
eat three times a day and that's that. Period. What a timesaver. My garage is almost 

cleaned!

If my body doesn't want to lose weight, tough. It's only getting what I give it on 
nos - no 
more. There is some more good news. My belt went in a notch, and although my scale 
this 
morning said I might have gotten a few pounds back, the notch stays comfortably where 
it 
is. I feel good. But then, I always have.

I've written pounds here, but they are converted from kilos. For those of you who are 

utterly dismayed at the numbers on your scale, do what I do. Use a metric scale. You 
won't 
be nearly so heavy.

So, keep on the nos, make it work, don't worry about time, don't worry about numbers, 

save money, putter around the house, increase free time, clean your garage, and I 
think I'll 
shut up now.

Tom
