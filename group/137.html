Hello Group,
I started the painless, no S diet last Monday and lost 5 pounds by
Friday. I could not believe it. We have been walking for several weeks 
now,
a small group of neighbors, 35 to 45 mins, 6 or 7 days a week, and my weight
stayed the same, although I felt a lot better getting the fresh air and
exercise and fun of walking and talking. Just a few days on no S and now 
we
are talking. Even if I only lose half that next week, I will be happy. 
Plus
I found I wasn&quot;t too &quot;snacky&quot; this weekend, and we own a store, and 
serve
ice cream, candy , pop, chips....had a cone yesterday, and one bag of choc
covered peanuts, and just one cone today. I will be right back on the no 
S
tommorrow as it is easy and it works......Bonnie

Hi Cheryl,

I think Jackie was talking about a special kind of
breakfast -- one involving multiple servings and/or
lots of maple syrup (congratulations, Jackie, to you
and your husband on making it to the first weekend).
Eating out is always fine on the no-s diet, subject to
the usual rules, of course. It sounds like you're
doing just fine.

Welcome and good luck!

Reinhard

&gt; Someone said that thank God it was an &quot;S&quot; day so
&gt; they could go out for breakfast. 
&gt; Why would you need an S day for that? Don't you
&gt; eat breakfast every day 
&gt; anyway? I thought you ate your 3 meals a day with
&gt; no sweets, snacks or seconds. 
&gt; For instance, last night I ate dinner out -- surf
&gt; and turf with a baked 
&gt; potato and vegetables. Does this go against the S
&gt; Diet? My weight has dropped 
&gt; about 1 1/2 lbs.
