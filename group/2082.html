&gt; Valerie, i am so glad that you posted about this . it has really 
given me a lot of hope. 
&gt; let me tell ya'... i was really feeling like a big LOSER when i 
would read you all's posts about how well you were doing, and i 
couldn't even manage to slash off 2 days in a row..i guess that i 
need to focus on my journey, and not everyone elses' journey 
thanks to you 
donna o

....Dear Donna :)
The nice thing about this group is how we all try to encourage each 
other....I am certain that everyone involved has had major 
challenges and setbacks, and that is part of the process...I am very 
happy Valerie posted that info, as it emphasizes an essential part 
of being successful: Not giving up!
But please, you are most definitely not a loser, and I'm sorry about 
your feelings of dissappointment and frustration.
Incase it helps at all, I am on my third month of NoS and my record 
for good N days was (I think) the first week or two...I've had some 
setbacks, like yesterday I caved into a huge craving for 
chocolate...so sue me! But in the large scheme of things, I am 
going in a forward direction and very happy with my NoS 
evolution...I have a good feeling about the upcoming months, and I 
am happy that the *VERY* destructive habits (ie night eating, 
drinking soda, having second's or thirds!) are really changing for 
good...
Please don't beat yourself up and keep staying positive :)
Love,
Deb
