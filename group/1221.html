Yes, I am supposed to concentrate on eating protein and reduce the carb
intake. As a matter of fact, if I eat too much carbs, I get ill. This
helps me keep from returning to old bad habits. It doesn't stop me from
developing new bad ones though. :-( I have started grazing (eat small
amounts of food/junk throughout the day).



Like Steve, my toughest part of the day is the night time. I tend to snack
more at night. Snacking is without a doubt, one of the worst dietary
habits we can have. Eating is supposed to serve a purpose. It should
nourish you and satisfy you. Snacking doesn't do either of those things.
Snacks tend to have very little nourishment and they tend to encourage 
you
to each more of them rather than satiate your hunger. Remember the
advertisement &quot;Bet you can't eat just one?&quot; Snack manufacturers 
program
their food to be habit forming.

Hi Thom
Welcome.
People I know who have had wls need to eat lots 
of protein and watch the carbs too. Do you do this too?
When I was a kid growing up snacking was not a thing we did. We waited 
for
our healthy meals. I guess I introduced snacking to my kids. 
Wishing you well on your journey.

Hi, my name is Thom, I am 45 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
I heard about this diet from a friend of mine. I believe I have tried
nearly every diet known to man over the years. I even had RNY bypass
surgery back in 2001. At my worst, I weighed 400+ pounds. After surgery 
I
lost 155 pounds. I have since regained 15 pounds. My biggest problem is
snacking. I do snack on sweets, so I guess I struggle with two of the S's.
Since I've had bypass surgery, seconds is not a problem. I typically, do
have seconds or thirds, but that's because I always take really small
portions. I don't know how much I will tolerate at any given time.
Sometimes, I can only eat half a burger and a few fries. Other times I 
can
eat a full burger, fries and a salad. Never can I eat more than the normal
person would consider a full plate.



I do have a problem with overly sweet, overly greasy or high carb foods.
That is a result of the surgery. It is a by product that helps you lose
weight. 



My goal is to lose another 60 pounds. I've been walking about a mile a 
day.
I am struggling with the no snacking rule. Having said that, it is easier 
to
deal wit when I know it's only for a few days and then I get a break.





Enough ramblings, that's my story thanks for listening.
