Hi Kristie,

&gt; I fear I MUST stop my
&gt; coffee and my

&gt; ago) with the 
&gt; treadmill I've been doing for 2 weeks and doing NoS
&gt; for a week now... 

This isn't a significant amount of time either for the
diet or the exercise. You've got plenty more left on
this frontier. Opening up new ones will just be a
distraction and an excuse to fail. 

&gt; pecan pie and 2 forks (one for DH) and CHEATED!!!
&gt; I'm so evil1! :c)

You're not evil, but don't do this. Keep the focus
here on these obvious failings before worrying about
borderline stuff that gives you a lot of pleasure for
relatively little cost. Besides, setting a precedent
that excesses like this can be made up for by extreme
deprivations is self revenge and terrible,
self-destructive psychology. What are you going to
give up to justify your next slice? 

&gt; But I feel better now and I'm ready to exercise even
&gt; more before I 
&gt; start to give up foods and drinks I love so much...

Don't worry about ramping this up until you've got a
base. If you're doing some exercise and literal nos,
over time, that should be sufficient. Days and a
couple of weeks aren't enough to make a call on this. 

&gt; It must not be 
&gt; enough or good exercise if it's still not making a
&gt; difference...

Cool it with the pecan pies and you'll see a
difference, trust me. Just give it some time.

Reinhard
