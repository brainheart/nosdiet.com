&gt; Hi Donna, Encourage him by your example, and by your preparation
&gt; of shared meals, but don't ram it down his throat.

....Yes, I completely concur...The nudgy naggy approach is bound to 
fail...For years, my mother tried to get my brother and I to eat 
scallops...She would go on about &quot;do you want to try some 
scallops?&quot; &quot;mmmm these are so good, do you want to try them?&quot; and 

finally &quot;come on! try them they are soo good&quot; Well of course as you 

can imagine, we spent about 15 years vehemently resisting eating 
Scallops...It became such a predictable thing to get this &quot;try 
scallops, you'll like them&quot; every time she made them for herself, 

that we even played a joke on her for one birthday, and, in addition 
to a normal present, we gift wrapped a box of frozen scallops, 
thinking that she would get the message to please stop ramming 
scallops down our throats...(incidentally I really love scallops 
now, but it was my own feeling to try them out that worked)

There was a Simpsons episode where Homer gets Bill Cosbys book on 
Fatherhood (a fun read btw) and the main key to success, it said, 
was to use &quot;reverse&quot; psychology with your kid...great episode, funny 

and accurate...I wouldn't go so far as to say blatantly use reverse 
psychology, as in *lying* to your child, but forcing them to see 
your point, through *your* eyes, won't ever work, one needs to &quot;back 

the heck up&quot; sometimes (this is a different way of viewing &quot;reverse&quot; 

psychology)

R.E. cont: But the biggest issue is yourself. If he's modeling your 
bad behaviors, he'll model your good. Prioritize getting your own 
habits in order. It's the best for him and you.

....This is the fundamental thing to remember as parents in general, 
and yes, especially regarding food and exercise habits in our kids.
They are watching people, really they are...Sucking in everything 
you do...It's the most powerful tool in your parenting arsenal, and 
believe it when I say, they will &quot;do what you do, and not what you 

say&quot; to do....If you ever wondered how to be a hero to your kid, be 

the best role model you can be, everyday, and they will get the 
message loud and clear...
Donna, if your kid is interested in being your partner, and helper, 
refer him to the site, and just see if he likes it :)
Richard doesn't seem to resent helping me out with my new plan, and 
we are both doing it...After all, it's really a great thing and why 
not get those habits early in life? If he wants something special, 
I don't begrudge him it, but I would say that he is eating about 90% 
less crap these days, and now we have fun ritualistic S days 
together, which are really a treat...7 eleven here we come!
Love,
Deb
