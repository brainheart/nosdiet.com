&gt; Yay you!
&gt; Sounds better than my day:

Hi Philip!!!
Sorry about that :(

I just barely missed the bus on the way to work and had to wait for 
the next one, which frustrated me so much that I took it out on a 
bag of chips I bought. And a couple of chocolate-chip cookies on the 
way home.
Ah well, tomorrow's another day.

Oh Philip, those chips had it coming!
I hope you don't miss your bus again, and if you do..buy some gum 
instead :)

Now NB to all my friends... I did specifically say I had a NoS 
*moment*... I will build on the memory of that good feeling but the 
truth is, when I got home I had *another* fight with my 
mother...just a small one, relatively speaking, and I wound up 
taking out *my* frustration on a gigantic portion of chinese sweet 
and sour beef (violation of 2 s's because of all the corn syrup in 
it and it was just a LOADED plate or two!)
Frustration eating is one of those life challenge toughies... We get 
so accustomed to the idea that food is there to comfort us, not just 
to nourish us. And it's hard to make good choices when you are 
really bummed out.
Keep up your chin mein freund!
Love,
Debbie 
(ps I was *just* thinking of you yesterday Philip! Cool you wrote!)
