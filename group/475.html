Okay, I have fallen off the wagon..........

I was doing great. No sodas, (which is a big step for me) No Sweets, No Seconds, No 
Snacks.....Exercise 3-5 times a week. I had it all. I even lost 10 pounds, I know 
this because I had 2 doctors appointments roughly a month apart and my weight at the 
first was 10 pounds heavier than at the second. Things were going great. Then 
&quot;she&quot; came to the door. 

She looked innocent, and definitely tugged at my heartstrings in her cute little 
uniform. She told me the story of how she needed the money to earn a prize and to 
help out those less fortunate. I'm a sucker for a worthy cause so I bought 11 
boxes........enough to earn her prize for her. I bought them and thought, I've done 
so well, I won't eat these, I'll send some to my brother in the Army, and some to my 
mom, and my kids can have a few, and of course my husband will take some to the 
office. It won't be a big deal. Big mistake. 

Those brightly colored boxes were on my counter for 5 minutes and I couldn't 
resist......resistance was futile. Before I knew it I was SNACKING...............on 
SWEETS........and I had SECONDS. Lord help me. 

I guess you have figured out by now that I am referring to Girl Scout Cookies. To 
those of you out there who have this weakness..........BEWARE, it's Girl Scout Cookie 
time. 

Today I promised myself that I would get rid of all of them. I sent a box to my 
brother, one to my mom saved a few that I don't like for the kids and the rest went 
to work with my husband. Whew............

I feel better having shared my story of weakness....does anyone out there sympathize? 
Okay so I've done my penance and now I'm onto a bowl of vegetarian vegetable soup for 
lunch..........does that make up? LOL

Jennifer
