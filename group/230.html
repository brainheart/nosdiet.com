Hi Joy,

Thanks for sharing that tidbit, I hadn't read that.
Obviously if that works for you, by all means go ahead
with it. There is room in my ecumen for no s + f. I
don't notice any digestive troubles myself and will
continue to eat my fruits with meals (in the tenuous
fashion I've described in other posts). And I'd
still advise no s + f ers to at least budget for the f
in their meal allocation, even if the fruit is
consumed much later/earlier. Don't want to run into
apple induced self discipline problems. Remember all
that trouble Adam and Eve got into because of a piece
of fruit...

&gt; Reinhard, I've been doing some researching on food
&gt; combining, and everywhere I look it says that you
&gt; can't eat fruit &quot;with&quot; anything else. You have to
&gt; eat it totally alone in order for your food to
&gt; digest well. I've put it to the test, and found it
&gt; to be true that when I eat fruit after my meal, I
&gt; tend to have problems with indigestion. You can eat
&gt; fruit 20 minutes to a half hour before the
&gt; meal...sort of as an appetizer with no ill effects. 
&gt; Also, I try to eat a fruit about two hours after a
&gt; protein meal and one hour after a carb meal as well,
&gt; to stave off the sweet cravings. It seems to be
&gt; working most of the time for me, and the extra fiber
&gt; is also helping me out. :) Thanks for your
&gt; encouragement!

&gt; Hi Joy,
&gt; 
&gt; As Kevin points out, fruit isn't just permitted,
&gt; it's
&gt; officially encouraged, and as the sweetest thing
&gt; you'll eat during the week, you'll come to
&gt; appreciate
&gt; it as you never have before. I would encourage you,
&gt; as
&gt; Kevin suggests, to associate fruit *with* your
&gt; meals,
&gt; instead of eating it in between, just so you don't
&gt; start compensating for all that good fruit with
&gt; lousy
&gt; meals. You don't have to wolf it down all at once,
&gt; but
&gt; make sure that when you're designing your &quot;first,&quot;
&gt; you
&gt; make room for the fruit. If the mass of food of on
&gt; that plate gives you pause, you should at least
&gt; force
&gt; yourself to appreciate the fact. Fruit is twice as
&gt; good when it takes the place of something bad.
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. Congratulations, Kevin. I'm happy to hear it's
&gt; working out for you.

&gt; &gt; To answer a few of your questions from my point of
&gt; &gt; view, fruit is the 
&gt; &gt; greatest thing for this diet. I eat an apple with
&gt; &gt; every breakfast, they 
&gt; &gt; supposedly give you as much energy as a cup of
&gt; &gt; coffee (and are much better 
&gt; &gt; for you). I often times have a &quot;dessert&quot; of grapes
&gt; &gt; or strawberries, a small 
&gt; &gt; portion that I eat at the end of the meal, though
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; keep these as a part of 
&gt; &gt; the proverbial plate. 
&gt; &gt; I'm what you called a carb addict. All I eat is
&gt; &gt; pizza, pasta, bread, and 
&gt; &gt; chili it seems. With pasta and bread being the
&gt; &gt; biggest. Toast for breakfast 
&gt; &gt; and lunch, pasta for dinner. Yet with this diet,
&gt; &gt; it's okay, and I'm proof 
&gt; &gt; now. I've only lost a few pounds, but the other
&gt; day
&gt; &gt; I realized something: 
&gt; &gt; the pants I bought this fall, cause I couldn't fit
&gt; &gt; well into my old pants, I 
&gt; &gt; can pull down without unbuttoning/zipping. I was
&gt; &gt; quite excited about this. 
&gt; &gt; I don't know how the weight itself stays on, but
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; fat, it's going away. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As for other updates on me, I feared thanksgiving,
&gt; &gt; yet when it came around, I 
&gt; &gt; found I only had 1.5 plates (and the half was just
&gt; &gt; corn, I love corn). I 
&gt; &gt; didn't want anymore, I was so proud of myself.
&gt; Also
&gt; &gt; Saturday night I went to 
&gt; &gt; Culvers (the only place in a large radius that
&gt; &gt; offers custard) for dinner. 
&gt; &gt; After dinner, we had assumed we would get some
&gt; &gt; custard, yet afterwards, I had 
&gt; &gt; NO desire for some. It was great. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Enough about me, welcome Joy, hope you find
&gt; yourself
&gt; &gt; as happy here as I am.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Good luck
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Kevin

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all! I am a 50 yr old lady, and I'm 5'2&quot; and
&gt; &gt; weigh 143 lbs as of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; this morning. I've already lost around 10 lbs
&gt; &gt; over the last several 
&gt; &gt; &gt; months mainly by trying to just stop snacking
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; staying away from 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sweets. I also have just started watching my
&gt; food
&gt; &gt; combining....not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; eating carbs together with proteins. I've
&gt; started
&gt; &gt; eating alot of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; fruit every day too, which seems to be making me
&gt; &gt; feel more 
&gt; &gt; &gt; energetic. I haven't been getting too sleepy in
&gt; &gt; the afternoons.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; My dad died of arterosclerosis and cardiac heart
&gt; &gt; disease when he was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 67 yrs. old. My mom has high blood pressure, my
&gt; &gt; brother died last 
&gt; &gt; &gt; year of colon cancer, and three of my sisters
&gt; (mom
&gt; &gt; had eight kids) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have had breast cancer. So....I think I need to
&gt; &gt; do my best to get 
&gt; &gt; &gt; as healthy as I can while I'm still pretty
&gt; young. 
&gt; &gt; Most people think 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm 35 by my appearance, but I already have
&gt; eight
&gt; &gt; grandchildren. :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I saw your webpage and decided to join
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; try out this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; eating plan as well in addition to my food
&gt; &gt; combining and fruit 
&gt; &gt; &gt; eating. :) Worth a try, right? But I am sure I
&gt; &gt; will have to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; extra careful on the &quot;S&quot; days because I have a
&gt; &gt; problem with trigger 
&gt; &gt; &gt; foods like pasta, bread, potatoes, and rice. 
&gt; &gt; Anyone else here a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; carb addict?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I went on the grapefruit diet, which is a high
&gt; &gt; protein/low carb diet 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that you stay on for 12 days and then go off of
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; for two days. So 
&gt; &gt; &gt; every other weekend you can eat what you like. 
&gt; &gt; That was pretty good 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for me, and I lost around 20 lbs. That was 5 yrs
&gt; &gt; ago, and I ended 
&gt; &gt; &gt; up over the years putting back on most of the
&gt; &gt; weight. So I tried 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the diet again, but couldn't stick with it too
&gt; &gt; well. So I'm food 
&gt; &gt; &gt; combining now, and feeling much healthier...no
&gt; &gt; more digestive upsets.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you allowed to eat fruit on this diet on
&gt; non-S
&gt; &gt; days? I usually 
&gt; &gt; &gt; eat nothing but fruit till lunch time. Breakfast
&gt; &gt; and mid-morning 
&gt; &gt; &gt; snack are fruits. And then I have another fruit
&gt; &gt; for my afternoon 
&gt; &gt; &gt; snack.
