Saleta, how long have you been on the diet? I know it took me a good 
month before I lost ANYTHING. Then it took me another month before it 
actually started moving significantly...(then the holidays hit...I'm not 

gonna tell you what just a couple days of sweets, and a week of doing 
nothing can do to a man.)
But, what I'm saying, is, stay with it. I was getting daunted by the no 

weight loss at first, but the thing that kept me going was the fact that 

I just felt better about myself. My body felt healthier after just the 

first week...Now I don't really notice THAT anymore, but I do feel the 

opposite when I find myself eating a bit too much, or drinking a coke. 

It should eventually come around.
If the healthier feeling isn't hitting you, find something else you like 

about the diet...The fact that it's so much easier than Jenny Creig's 
point system (gonna follow this email up with a story about that)

Good luck!!!!
Kevin

&gt;A small confession to the group. I caved in today and had a second. 

&gt;Okay a heaping second. I guess we are bound to fail once in a while. 

&gt;It doesn't mean I am any less accountable. 
&gt; I was doing so well and I weighed in yesturday and I din't lose 
&gt;anything, infact I gained. Am I doing something wrong? I am sticking 

&gt;to all the stipulations and I am even a bit hungry at the end of the 

&gt;day and still not eating any snacks before bed (which is a real 
&gt;hurdle for me)! Any suggestions? I guess I ate more at dinner due to 

&gt;being so dissapointed in myself and fell into that defeatist 
&gt;attitude crap as I'm famous for! I do have an eating disorder 
&gt;backround but I am one of those who never got dangerosly underweight 

&gt;and was currently back in recovery and let my weight creep back up. 

&gt;I am 30 lbs from where I am most comfortable. I'm terrified that I 

&gt;am stuck here at this weight and will never get back down without 
&gt;the use of past drastic measures. I am struggling right now. 
&gt; Sorry for rambling, it just helps to &quot;talk it out&quot; ya know. Thank 

&gt;you for listining.
