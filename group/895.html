Welcome Allan, and thanks for joining several of the
groups. I can tell you're going to be a lot of fun
already. My &quot;French&quot; isn't so hot these days, but I'm
happy to hear no s translates.

The scale advice you gave in your other post is great.
I prefer not to look at all except maybe once a month
or so, but if you can't stop yourself, averaging out
is great advice. It's just so dangerous
psychologically, otherwise. People get too excited
about tiny fluctuations and it throws them off. It's
like day trading vs. buying and holding a stock, or
rather buying a stock with the intention of holding it
for the long term and then checking it pointlessly
every few minutes.

A related piece of advice: one reason people are so
hooked on scales is that they want milestones. This in
itself is natural and good, but here's a better
milestone than pounds lost, at least in the beginning:
days on habit. Get yourself a calendar and mark a red
slash through every successful non-s-day. First
milestone is a day, then a week. I usually give 3
weeks as the time it takes to form a habit, but a
slashed out month might be more visually inspiring.
Yes, pounds are ultimately what you want to lose, but
it's like the &quot;teach a man to fish&quot; proverb. I'm not a
big fan of keeping track of things, but if you can
make it to this stage, I doubt you'll have to any
longer. And think what a great souvenir it'll make.
Oh, if anyone actually does this, let me know.

&gt; Hello everyone
&gt; I'm Allan, 38/m, live in S. Texas. I came across the
&gt; NOS diet on a fitness bulletin board. I think
&gt; Reinhard's ideas, both the diet and shovelglove, are
&gt; fantastic and funny, a winning combination. Nothing
&gt; beats grandma's advice, right? Eat breakfast, don't
&gt; snack you'll ruin your dinner, and stay away from
&gt; the
&gt; candy, junior! 
&gt; 
&gt; I think the &quot;S&quot; in the NOS diet stands for something
&gt; else though &lt;grin&gt;. If you'll permit me a small use
&gt; of
&gt; French, I think it should be called the No Shit
&gt; diet.
&gt; Here's why:
&gt; 
&gt; Them: &quot;Hey, how did you lose all that weight and get
&gt; into such great shape? Any tips?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; You: &quot;Eat three squares a day, don't snack, and stay
&gt; away from junk food.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; Them: &quot;No shit, really?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; You: &quot;Yeah, no shit.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; I look forward to being a member of this group and
&gt; sharing in the fun.
&gt; 
&gt; Later.
