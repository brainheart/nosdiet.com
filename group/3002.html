Hi Folks (I said *folk* okay!??? LOL )
So Richard and I have had more than our allotted S days, but 
yesterday we indulged in very large amounts of corn syrup thanks to 
the large size slurpees we drank...
Whew, I really think this did a major number on me... we actually 
started Ssing on Thursday! Lame!
So I really look forward to sanity tomorrow and this month we will 
not be doing double S duty anymore... I know this might sound a bit 
reactive, but I really think high corn syrup is addictive in a way 
that other sweeteners aren't (and the general mass consumption of 
this seems to back my theory up...)
I was cranky today, I found myself eating in the middle of the night 
and ate a whole six ounce package of sliced ham....
What is good about feeling bad right now, is that I am not in denial 
about it and it is reminding me to stick with healthy habits.
I still love to have the freedom and celebration that comes from our 
s days, but I enjoy it more when I know my body isn't suffering from 
overdoing it....
I know I have complimented you Reinhard many many times in the past 
for all the great stuff you have bestowed upon us, the huddled fat 
masses! LOL but I will end this letter with one more..

Here is my most heartfelt thank you for being able to peek into the 
overeaters psyche, analyze it intelligently and with acute 
perception to it's most sneaky details, and also see the mental and 
physical benefits to your many theories based on &quot;carrot and stick&quot; 

and your awareness of the guilt cycle as well... Sorry I know that 
was a run on sentence... I still can't totally put what I want to 
say into words but I will say that more than once I have found 
myself in situations where various words or catch phrases from your 
home page will pop into my mind and I think to myself...

&quot;Wow this guy is truly brilliant!&quot;

I think you should submit NOS to the folks who award the Nobel Peace 
Prizes!

Hope all you guys are having a good weekend and good luck...
PS...Thanks Navin for writing to me off list about your great weight 
loss news, your adherence and perseverence is truly paying off and 
it has reinspired me when I needed it...

Now everyone all together, &quot;We love you Reinhard oh yes we do, we 

don't love anyone as much as you. When you're not near us, we're 
blue, oh Reinhard we love you!!!&quot; :)
Peace,
Deb
