 Dear Mel,
Loved your letter....can really relate as everything you said about each
diet has happened to me. My husband and man who works 
in the shop next to us are losin weight like crazy on Adkins, and I only
gain on that one. Used to smoke drink wine and coffee, instead of eat,
worked great, but almost killed me....as did the endless trips to the
bathroom on the high fiber!
So now I do the no S and Meditterean Diet Combo, which is the best diet 
I
have ever done....Low fat meats, some eggs, cheese,
but mostly yougart, veges, some fruit and beans, and gallons of wine &amp; 
olive
oil....just kidding about those last two, but I do have a little of each....
no sugar and not too much pasta nor pizza, those, although they are
vegetarian, not vegan, can pile the pounds on me.
You may say so S and very little P, including potatoes,pies,pastry,ect.
works the best....low white flour.,animal fat, and trans fat.

I have gotten older, more sedentary due to work, and so have gained
25lbs neatly around my midsection (the danger zone). My arms and
legs remain thin so I look extra silly. Some days I long for those
comfy maternity pants I stupidly thought I no longer needed after
finishing the procreative phase of my life.
I used to lose weight easily on the &quot;Smoke Constantly, Drink Tonnes
of Coffee Diet&quot;, but that seems to have been ruled unhealthy lately,
so I tried a modified &quot;Drink Water Constantly, Eat Only Things That
are Green&quot; which worked for a while(perhaps due to the fabulous
workout I got by going to the bathroom 87 times a day), but the
weight returned when I began to eat other colours.
I find I hate those Atkins types who are losing weight like crazy all
around me by eating entire herds of animals. I think its fun to
congratulate them on their ketosis by presenting them with breath
mints. They have motivated me to find another way.
I am a vegetarian(a little octo-lavo) and I know some people hate me
for it, but really I'm not pushy about it, it's a personal thing. So
as I searched the internet for weight loss plans and was bombarded by
these high meat diets I became a little discouraged. And then this!
Wow, put less food in my face and swing a hammer around. I cannot
wait for this to work. I hope the creator(sorry name eludes me now)
becomes wildly famous and spin-off diet plans follow.

Mel (as in Melanie)
