.....Hi Navin R. :)

&gt; Now, losing weight is a totally different scenario. This is a 
case where doing something, even if it is less than perfect, is 
better than doing nothing at all. If you cut out, say, seconds, but 
still eat sweets, that's not perfect, but it's way better than 
having 3 plates at the Chinese buffet.
....I used to do that often, now we only go once in a long while, 
but I am astounded at my change of feelings about overeating, in 
general, so it's not such a free for all...it used to be total 
gluttony on parade (in extra large booth seating!)

&gt; Because of these two starkly different examples, that's why I 
always get the heebie geebies when I hear phrases like, &quot;If it's 
worth doing,it's worth doing right&quot; or &quot;If it's worth doing, it's 

worth not doing right&quot;, because these blanket statements are 
worthless - I can find many examples that could prove either one 
wrong.
....You know they give shots for the heebie jeebies nowadays :)

&gt; I'd say, simply ask yourself, given a task, if doing it,but not 
doing it right is better than not doing it at all. For No-S, the 
answer to me is that doing some of it is indeed much better than not 
doing it at all. 
&gt; Just my two cents (before taxes and inflation).

.....Thanks for &quot;Navins Nightline 2 cent Editorial&quot; :) 
Are you eating any chocolate cake today? LOL
Peace and Love,
Deb
ps. are you still getting residuals for the invention of 
the &quot;optigrab&quot;? LOL
