Thanks for the helpful replies guys! I'm starting today!!! :)I'm 
feeling motivated, really motivated. SO I am hoping this feeling of 
motivation will hold out until this way of eating becomes habitual. 
This should happen, because it doesn't take a PhD to understand this 
diet ;) Thanks again!

Amy

PS: hope you dont mind, but I plugged www.nosdiet.com on my diet 
group in the links section and talked about how awesome it was.

&gt; Welcome, Amy.
&gt; 
&gt; Fast food is not off limits. You can enjoy it every
&gt; once in a while with a clear conscience. But
&gt; obviously, if you eat it every meal, no-s isn't going
&gt; to work. It's common sense, not magic.
&gt; 
&gt; But don't worry about fast food too much in the
&gt; beginning. Just make sure to get the literal rules
&gt; down. Once you've gone 3 weeks strict you can worry
&gt; about how much fast food you're eating. If you're a
&gt; fast-foodaholic now, my guess is the literal rules
&gt; will have a big impact without additional
&gt; intervention.
&gt; 
&gt; A while ago I proposed &quot;no supersizes&quot; as an
&gt; additional S for people who have trouble with fast
&gt; food. And remember that sugar-soda is out.
&gt; 
&gt; Best of luck to you and let us know how it goes,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi, I'm Amy. I'm 23 and I live in Alabama. I heard
&gt; &gt; about this diet 
&gt; &gt; from a friend in my diet group on yahoo. I read the
&gt; &gt; No S Diet webpage 
&gt; &gt; and had to join up. This seems so easy and
&gt; &gt; convienient. I am looking 
&gt; &gt; to lose about 20-30 lbs. This will put me at 100-110
&gt; &gt; lbs but I'm 
&gt; &gt; 4'11&quot; and that is actually in the range of my
&gt; &gt; healthy weight. Here is 
&gt; &gt; my problem and concern. I am a fastfoodaholic. Now I
&gt; &gt; know that fast 
&gt; &gt; food should be sparce and eaten in moderation
&gt; &gt; anyways, but is it off 
&gt; &gt; limits for this diet? I know this is a dumb
&gt; &gt; question, but unless I 
&gt; &gt; missed it on the web page (which I may have) I didnt
&gt; &gt; see fast food 
&gt; &gt; mentioned directly as to whether it is off limits. I
&gt; &gt; am a newbie to 
&gt; &gt; this no s concept so please go easy. I am looking
&gt; &gt; forward to meeting 
&gt; &gt; you guys.
