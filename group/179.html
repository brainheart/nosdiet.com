I haven't been doing so well lately and the scales show it. Last night after a 
satisfying dinner I still wanted soemthing sweet. I ate an apple over the course of 
about an hour and then a handful of raisins. Somewhere I've got this thing in my head 
that says after a meal I need something sweet. Last night hasn't been the only 
infraction.

Sunday at a restaurant I told my father-in-law about the no &quot;S&quot; diet. He 
said, &quot;I like the Atkins, I lost 12 pounds.&quot; He went on to elaborate that 
he only did it for a few weeks a month or so ago, but it worked. I told him no one 
can maintain such a regimen for too long, and it's too hard, besides being unhealthy. 
He shrugged me off.

I don't consider this a &quot;diet&quot; but a lifestyle I must maintain the rest of 
my life. My brain accepts that, but I also love food. I've never been really 
overweight, but there are clothes in my closet I can't wear in public. I could use a 
pep talk as the weekend is coming up and the holidays are right around the corner. 
Did I mention I love to bake goodies around the holidays 

Teresa
