Hi Melanie,

We are all happy for you and admire your determination. Could you tell
us how long did it take you to come to this stage, and during the
process, what did you experience, especially when it was so tempting
to just take a bite ...

I tried but have not been successful yet. For awhile, I skipped
dinner, which worked well for a few months. There was some weight
loss. Then my flatmate got sick so I started cooking for her. Then, I
went back to eating dinner. Since then, I did not have the courage to
step on the weigh anymore!

Have a nice and &quot;light&quot; week!

I am not discouraged by what you said. I appreciate
you keeping me grounded. I am well aware scales can
fluctuate and make you think your not getting
anywhere. I have been there and done that. I just
had to share my excitment. I had thought I had gained
and then to step on the scale and see I had lost
another 2 lbs was a thrill. I have been trying to
stay focused on what I really want, and what I really
need. I am 28, I am determined to get under 200 lbs
and stay under before I turn 30. I refuse to spend
the rest of my life feeling older than I am. I don't
care how long it takes now. I don't care if for each
step forward, I take a step back, as long as in the
end I am progressing. I would be satisfied with 1/2 a
lb a week loss if in the end it meant the lbs stay
gone and don't bring back friends. I hope to be
able to say in a year, look how far I have come. Prior
to having my first child I was at what I thought was
fat, but a healthy weight of 155 lbs. Then during my
first pregnancy I gained over 65lbs. After her birth
I was @ 180lbs and couldn't seem to lose anymore. 
Then with my second pregnancy I gained a little less
than the last time but,managed to get down to 180lbs
again then came my 3rd pregnacy I avoided gaining to
much weight but,this time I stayed over the 200lb mark
My 4th pregnancy came along and the recovery took
longer than before. I topped out at 230lbs weighing
almost as much as my husband. I got myself down to
222 lbs just writing down what I ate religiously for
about 2 months. I couldn't sustain that. That is
when I went looking for help. For about a year I was
able to maintain the weight of 222 lbs. In my search
I found NoS and hear I see a program I shouldn't have
any trouble maintaining. You see I am not expecting
miracles, I am not looking to wake-up 100lbs thinner
over night. I want something I can live with for the
rest of my life. I have a lot of life ahead of me, I
don't want to waste it,dieting and or being fat and
uncomfortable. I want to enjoy the rest of my life
with my husband and children and not spend it
watching every bite I put in my mouth. Sorry this
post was so long. Your friend in health, Melanie

&gt; 
&gt; Melanie,
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you weren't discouraged by my last post. I
&gt; just
&gt; wanted to fortify you against a possible scale
&gt; fluctuation the other way. Caution is important, but
&gt; it shouldn't trump encouragement. Consider this a
&gt; second pat on the back for that one word of warning.
&gt; 
&gt; Brian,
&gt; 
&gt; He who loses fifty pounds does not have to justify
&gt; his
&gt; peanut butter and banana sandwiches! Of course this
&gt; is
&gt; fine. I should be asking *you* what is fine!
