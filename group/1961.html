&gt; Hi friends - 
&gt; I wonder if I could ask again, could everyone please delete all or 

most of the message you are replying to, when you post a reply? 
Most of us can remember for at least one day what we've been talking 
about (I hope...)

...Speak for yourself Sheats! LOL
Actually Diane, there is a possibility that some newbies to the 
internet/post groups aren't aware that they can edit the content of 
the reply and &quot;snip&quot; out parts (aka delete sections, and leave in 

the parts they are replying to) I did this at first when I joined 
the group, and a member wrote, &quot;can I be cheeky and ask that we 
snip&quot; blah blah blah...
So here's another idea for you busy lady! :)
What I do, is I save the YahooNoS diet group to my &quot;favorites&quot; and I 

just check in whenever I feel like it... I skip the email altogether 
and opt for none to be sent, and just check the posts when I want :)
This is probably another reason I write so much :)! 

So anyone who doesn't know how to &quot;clip&quot; it's easy :)
1. Hit reply
2 Highlight the areas you want to clip out that are not cogent to 
your new comments.
3. Delete any spaces between words so it looks like a sentence, not 
an alphabetical battlefield or computer language :)

then
4. Insert your comments where you want to, either before or after 
the previously existing text.
I used to have no editing skills whatsoever and look at me now!
Writing is fun.

And if you don't want to be a super anal text snipper (like I am LOL)
you can just post a new message and it's even easier!
You know I was just kidding about the super anal stuff. It does seem 
to help the memory if an existing comment is already there. Then 
it's more like a continuing conversation.
I am going to try to get a start on three clean weeks today, I've 
been pretty sketchy these last several days, and I'd like to begin 
with a clean slate, and just leave the rest behind...
How's it going Cat and Lee? Let's think of all of us as being a 
group of No&quot;Superheros&quot; and fight fat today! To the fatmobile! 
LOL

Good Luck to everybody today :)!
Thanks for being a great bunch of supporters.
Love,
Deb
