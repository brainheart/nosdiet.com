Hi Julie,

Boy I can relate to coming home depressed after trying on clothes, it can 
be
one of the worst experiences sometimes. Good job not drowning your sorrows
in ice cream, don't know that i'd be that strong. :) As far as the exercise
being hard, I know how that goes too, when I first started teaching
aerobics, I had knee problems. Makes it very hard to get motivated to
exercise. Was wondering if you'd ever tried pilates. They are often used
in physical therapy and if you have an gentle routine, it might work well
for you. I've got a dvd I love called Pilates Complete For Weight Loss 
by
Bodywisdonmedia. Its got routines for beginning, intermediate and and
advanced plus you can choose the length of the workout from 10 minutes up 
to
30 minutes. Anywho...I&quot;m done rambling now lol. :) :) Take care!

Carrie :)

&gt; HI Debbie, So sorry to hear about Richard, You are so right about
&gt; boys, even though mine is 43. His nickname is Murphy( seriously)
He
&gt; could get hurt sleeping. We laugh about it and i pray for his
&gt; safety everyday.You cant tell them not to do something at least
&gt; until their doddering.
&gt; .....Whoever Murphy was, he is on my S*@#t list...LOL
&gt; I appreciate your response Jools, I hope your big baby didn't kill
&gt; too many brain cells that night, and I commend you and him for not
&gt; getting behind the wheel! But dottering or not, once a stubborn
&gt; person, always a stubborn person, just older and less teeth!
&gt; I am actually thrilled that Richard has such determinism, he just
&gt; needs to learn how to do these things so he won't get hurt....
&gt; Boy he's only 8, I can't wait until he's 18!
&gt;
&gt; Well i weighed in at Publix and about fell off the scale in
&gt; shock, i had no idea i weighed that much and it was quite
depressing
&gt; and i wished i had never gotten on it.
&gt; ....Sorry about that one :(
&gt; Remember, you were wearing shoes and clothes, and who the heck
knows
&gt; how good the &quot;Publix&quot; scale is? If you must weigh yourself, do 
it
at
&gt; home, so it can be as consistant as possible, and do it when you
&gt; wake up...Weigh your peaches at the supermarket, not yourself :)
&gt; Have a good day oh eternal rocker!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

HI Deb &amp; all Another day, not another weigh in!!I had to go shopping
last night,looking for something to wear to a wedding this Friday. I
got so depressed. Nothing at all fit right. I guess if i had all the
$$ i could shop at one of the designer stores, maybe i could find
something that looked good on my body type. BIG PEAR:( Was so
depressed by the time i got home its amazing i didnt sit down to a
bowl of ice cream. Fixed a margarita and vegged for the next 2
hours.DH knew better than to say anything to me when he saw the look
on my face as i got home. So tired of being fat. Some people would
say and have to me, but Julie you look fine, why would you want to
lose weight? Because i have 40# extra around my tummy and butt.I was
nearly tempted as most of us are by a quick fix of an extreme diet
with quick results. been there done that and gained it all back ++.
If i had something in my closet that fit me i would wear it. Taking
my daughter out tonight to find her a dress or nice slacks for the
wedding. Maybe i will get lucky.we will see, so much easier to shop
when you are thin. :( I dont find this diet hard, exercise is hard
because of my hip problems. If i walk i am in pain .... Sorry for
rambling, just one of those day I guess. Thanks for listening
everyone,I really dont have anyone else to talk to abou this as i
work an extreme amount of hours and have no life beyond work. Talk
to you all later on bye til then Julie
