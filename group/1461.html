Hey Debbie,
Thanks for the reply - and the tip about eggplant! Darn I love eggplant, and 
mushrooms too. Both are not good so I hear for joint swelling. Oh well I guess I'll 
just have to do without. By the way I have been meaning to ask -- What is a 
shovelglove? Who is this ranger you chat about? And Who is Reinhard - if he's not the 
guy behind the curtain? lol
Woke up this morning feeling like the wicked witch of the east though! Wanted 
something sweet really, really bad to go with my coffee. Went down stairs and got on 
my Gazelle and excercised for 20 minutes instead. Now I feel like Glenda the Good 
witch of the north -- lol. Wouldn't it be nice to live in fairyland where we could 
make all our dreams come true? NAH I'd probably take advantage and they'd strip me of 
any rights to have what ever I wanted. --hahaha! Well just to let you know my 
daughter won her volleyball game! YAY she was so excited and up beat. I wish I still 
had all that energy. I do love seeing her play it just reminds me of all the fun I 
had playing the sport. Had a great day yeaterday went to curves and got measured and 
weighed! I've lost 3 lbs and 5 and 1/2 inches -- YAY me! Can't wait till the NoS 
helps make it more -- woohoo! Have a gr8t day all.

Annie

Hi land of OZ
&quot;Were off to see the Wizard&quot;
Here the Wizard of S is Reinhard, not the guy behind the curtain.
&quot;Step away from that curtain, pay no attention to that man!&quot;
I agree that is one of the best movies of all time
Annie, I actually wrote you like a 10KB letter the first night that 
I read your initial post... There must have been a problem 
submitting it and I was hopping mad when I realized it got lost and 
didn't show up the next day on the group site...I will try to 
recapture the thrust of it, though for me, once it leaves my 
fingers, travels through the computer, and out there, it is really 
out for good with my lousy short term memory LOL!

First, congratulations on joining us and of course I will pray for 
you, and all of us, to succeed...I can't imagine how those years 
with the RA had to be on you..I'm glad you took your willpower 
off &quot;the shelf&quot; as you put it...My brain is starting to melt down 

since it is mid afternoon here and that is usually when my mind is 
least potent...Siesta perhaps, nah just a little brain drain.
Stick with the No S lifestyle and even after that 1st week you will 
realize how much better you feel about eating for health and long 
term commitment to it...It is addictive in that you gain so much 
more than you give up, I hope you find it enjoyable...I wrote a post 
about two weeks ago and forgive me No S'sers but I will be redundant 
for our new friend

Paraphrased roughly from the editor of Prevention Magazine in a 
motivational lecture on weight loss, and maintainence.

When you have a Setback don't get upset...Instead
Welcome it, embrace it!
Only people going someplace have Setbacks
Successful people have setbacks
They are a sign you are on your way
to something better.
When you have a Setback (and we all have them)
Keep moving ahead and you will make it :)

I also remember you setting a goal of 2lbs a week...This is fine and 
good,but don't let the weeks of plateus or even maybe minor gains 
disappoint you so that you then fall into the all to familiar cycle 
of &quot;Kicking Thine Own Arse&quot; and getting disheartened..We are all 

cheering you on! Be patient with yourself and take each day, one at 
a time. Fake Hollandaise sounds pretty good...I never cared much 
for the real kind, too goopy :) And I love sauces and stuff that 
uses yogurt...I used to take Brown Cow or Stoneyfield Farm plain 
yogurt and mix dehydrated soup mix into it (hey that sounds like 
your idea) no wait, vegetable soup mix, and frozen spinach to make a 
really great dip.

Love
Debbie
PS...I heard that Eggplant triggers an inflammatory response and can 
worsen the symptoms of RA, so, incase your Rheumatologist hasn't 
already mentioned it, in addition to 3 No S's add No E (for 
eggplant) to your plan :)
