&gt; Debbie,
&gt; WOOHOO on the pants! That is such a good feeling! And I don't know 

about you, but this is SUCH a more reliable indicator of how I am 
doing than what the scale says!!!! Congrats!
&gt; Jeanette
....Thanks a lot Jeanette :) Are you new? Or have you been lurking?
I totally agree with you about that...I did an experiment a few days 
back and weighed myself once at night, with pms and then in the 
morning...I wanted to see if I could keep and even emotional keel to 
the results, knowing full well they would be very different numbers.
At night vs. morning, and with a lot of temporary water, there was a 
difference of 5 lbs more at night!
Of course my mood went on a rollercoaster, non withstanding my plans 
to keep and even keel!
I am a huge proponent of measuring my waist instead, but for the 
life of me I have no idea what happened to my tapemeasure...My son 
probably has it somewhere in his messy room :)
The reason we are trying to lose weight is so we can look and feel 
better, the scale never seems to do anything other than disappoint, 
and it is very very fickle. So I do my best to weigh only at a 
minimum and feel much happier about my waistline going down. To this 
day my weight has only dropped around 5 or 6 lbs, but I have lost 3 
inches off my waist!
If you are new, welcome :)
Have a great one!
Peace,
Deb
