&gt; HI Deb &amp; ALL, Reporting in finally today. The party friday was 

delish, ate way too much of course, but could have had more i am 
sure :) Didnt even finish my dessert :O took it home for the 13yo.I 
was ill yesterday from eating mexican take out on saturday night. 
Wont be getting food from there again, i was an inch close to food 
posioning. I have had it 3 times in the past 2 years. Not something 
i desire to go through ever again. I took my daughter to get her 
hair done saturday, she looks like Avril now. real rocker chick :) I 
had a great day with her.As far as peyote goes, havent done any 
drugs since i was 18-19. walked away from it, for like you,i did not 
like the way it made me feel anymore.I dont like taking any meds at 
all if I can help it. I ate garlic last night, because i felt like i 
was getting a cold. Feel much better today.I couldnt believe the 
number of posts over the weekend. Our cable was out over the weekend 
so couldnt get on the site.I hope to have a good week of slashing. 
Nothing special going on this week, no parties etc so should be 
easier. We sure do have our share of lurkers on this group don't 
we ?? LOL :)Well i hope we all have a wonderful week of NOS and i 
pray i actually lose something this week. talk to all later JOOLS 
&gt; 
&gt; --- &gt; &gt;&gt; ....Are you sure you weren't catching &quot;roaches&quot;? LOL 
:)
&gt; You silly degenerate :)
&gt; Debberoo
&gt; !
