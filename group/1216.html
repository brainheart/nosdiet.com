Hello Thom, Shannon, and Steve welcome to Nos. 

Steve I began this lifestyle change two weeks ago today. I am 
vey happy with it. The last time I weighed I was 289lbs (on a 6'3&quot; 

frame). The only medical condition I have is high blood pressure. 
Anyway, I elect not to weigh myself. I go to the doctor 
approximately every six months. I chose to let the doc check the 
scale. Besides, if I am living &quot;Livita Nosa&quot; (I know bad joke), 

weight loss is inevitable. Now enough about me. I would like to 
address your issue of being hungry in the evenings. I am trying to 
follow Reinhard's schedule (I may be off slightly) because it works 
for me. Breakfast at 7am, lunch at 12:30 and Dinner at 7:30pm. By 
the time I finish eating dinner, doing cleanup, and an hour or so 
reading time it is time for bed. I am not sure as to what type of 
schedule you have. But you may want to attempt something similar. 
Shedule Dinner 3hrs or so before bedtime. Once again, welcome and 
remember, slow and steady may not win the race but it definitely 
finishes the race. 

Thanks for reading.

&gt; Hello everyone, my name is Steve. I just read Thom's post, and 
&gt; figured I'd go ahead and jump in too. I'm 48 years old and I live 

in 
&gt; Jacksonville Fl. I am the friend that told Thom about the 
NOSDiet. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried many diets in the past and lost and regained several 

&gt; hundred pounds. My largest loss was 110 pounds on Optifast, a 500 

&gt; calorie a day doctor supervised liquid diet. I went from 330 to 
&gt; 220. That was in 1991-1992. Just when I was going on the 
&gt; maintenance phase, I lost my job of 13 years, and had to relocate 

my 
&gt; family to Tampa for a new job. Needless to say, I never learned 
&gt; about maintenance, and gained it all back, and then some. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have been looking for something that would work to help me 
&gt; permanently lose weight. I have become convinced over the years 
that 
&gt; any kind of overly complicated or depravation diet would just not 

&gt; work for me long term. 
&gt; 
&gt; I found the NOSDiet using Google. I have been doing the diet since 

&gt; last Tuesday. I really like the simplicity of this diet. I am 
6'0' 
&gt; and as of last Tuesday I weighed 370 pounds. My current goal is 
to 
&gt; loose 160 pounds. Yesterday I weighed in at 365, 5 pounds lost in 

&gt; the first week, only 155 to go! This was even after going to a 
&gt; family get together on Saturday for my nephews college graduation.
&gt; (BBQ ribs &amp; chicken, great side dishes that everyone brought, and 

the 
&gt; deserts...) I splurged a bit on Sunday as well. 
&gt; 
&gt; I stuck to the NOS's all during the week though. I am finding the 

&gt; diet a little hard in the evenings. It seems like no matter how 
full 
&gt; I stack my one plate at dinner, I still am hungry again later in 
the 
&gt; evening. I have just been drinking lots of water and trying to 
&gt; ignore it.
&gt; 
&gt; Well that's all for now.. good luck to everyone!
