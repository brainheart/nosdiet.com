Hi Maria,

I've created a poll to help you get the best possible
answer to your question.

See:




Please keep two things in mind:

1) no one except for me (and Justin) has been on this
diet for very long. 

2) I think only answers from people who have been on
the diet for at least 3 weeks are meaningful, so
that's how I framed the question. But that's not a lot
of people at the moment.

3) the poll will never close, so people can change
their answers as they progress/fail miserably. This
means the poll will get more and more informative as
people try the diet.

Keep in mind that internet polling is hugely
inaccurate and subject to abuse. But I'm not aware
that anyone else is doing anything better.

Good luck!

Reinhard

&gt; Hello
&gt; I accidently found the no s diet website and found
&gt; it very 
&gt; interesting. I talked to my mom about it and she
&gt; and I decided to 
&gt; try it. My downfall is chocolate and I figured this
&gt; diet will help 
&gt; me. I have been trying the weightwatchers diet on
&gt; my own with some 
&gt; success but I am tired of counting all the &quot;points&quot;
&gt; all the time. I 
&gt; probably sounded dumb when I would comment outloud
&gt; how many points I 
&gt; was eating. 
&gt; 
&gt; I just wanted to ask from you guys if you could tell
&gt; me how many 
&gt; weeks you have been on this diet and how many pounds
&gt; you have lost? 
&gt; Thank You,
&gt; 
&gt; Maria 
&gt;
