&gt; On Shovelglove: having visible abs comes down to two
&gt; things: 1) having a low enough bodyfat percentage, and
&gt; 2) having built-up the abs through work. The
&gt; abdominals do have a flexion function (i.e. the one
&gt; that is used in crunching) but further, they have a
&gt; stabilization function. Stabilization is the main
&gt; function of the abdominals, and if you swing around a
&gt; heavy sledgehammer for 14 minutes a day, you will
&gt; develop this function (i.e. objective #2). In
&gt; addition, you'll burn some extra calories that will
&gt; help you achieve objective #1. 


If you're serious
&gt; about building up your abs, you shouldn't be doing
&gt; crunches, anyway... they're useless. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Come on, *useless* ????? I would have never thought it 
went that far. What I had been doing is a set of 10 different ab 
exercises, on the floor, including crunches, leg lifts, pull knees to 
the chest, bicycles, touch toes, etc. Are you saying ALL of these are 
useless for building abs? Are all of these replaced by the relatively 
simple shovelglove exercises, and in fact is shovelglove even more 
effective? 
&gt; 
&gt; On Jared from Subway:
&gt; 
&gt; NOS succeeds where Jared's plan is weak: that is, it
&gt; allows for variation in the diet. I originally read
&gt; about Jared's plan a few years ago in Men's Health,
&gt; and they said it was critically low in several
&gt; nutrients. The reason for this is that he had the same
&gt; stuff for lunch and dinner, every day! Now, he
&gt; mastered portion control, but at the cost of
&gt; nutrition. The funny thing is, too, if you look at the
&gt; guy, he's still kinda rotund. (Skinny fat). He was
&gt; getting somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 g of
&gt; protein a day... which isn't terribly good for anyone.
&gt; The point is, a varied diet is rule #1 for any good
&gt; eating plan, and NOS succeeds (at least, insofar as
&gt; your natural eating is varied). 
&gt; 
&gt; Dan 
&gt; 

Yes, I know that his diet wasn't perfect, but techcically he could 
have said he was following nosdiet, skipping weekly s-days. My main 
reason for bringing this up is to show proof that calorie restriction 
works, to the tune of 245# in a year's time, and the fact that he 
kept it simple and only had 3 &quot;windows&quot; of opportunity a day helped 

him achieve something unbelievable. And now, he is a national icon, 
married, and probably making pretty good money just from being 
accidentally famous. 

As far as skinny fat, you have to cut the guy some slack. After all, 
he *did* go from over 400lbs to about 190. He's not gonna look like 
the calvin klein underwear model.
