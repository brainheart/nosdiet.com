&gt; In Response to the statement that the American system
&gt; of healthcare is uncivilized -- to an extent that is
&gt; true, however there are no people dying on the street
&gt; in agony either. And yes, I have ben treated in the
&gt; emergency room that also contained everyone from
&gt; vagrants to wealthy people. Emergency rooms do not
&gt; refuse care in critical situations as the hypocratic
&gt; oath would not allow such behavior from a doctor.Most
&gt; towns and cities of any size have paramedics supported
&gt; by the local and state governments that provide first
&gt; responder care that is world class. Smaller localities
&gt; are staffed with volunteers who must be completely
&gt; trained and certified by a government agency. Yes,
&gt; there are doctors that are in medicine almost solely
&gt; for money, but they are usually plastic surgeons who
&gt; make a living off the insercurities of people who want
&gt; fat sucked away or vain women wanting their boobs
&gt; enlarged. The American system of healthcare has
&gt; virtually been crippled by lawyers(baristers?) who sue
&gt; for and win outrageous sums of money and drive
&gt; malpratice insurance up for doctors (who pass the
&gt; costs on to patients). Medicaid is given to all of the
&gt; the poor which ensures them of medical treatment that
&gt; often is the best in the world and costs taxpayers
&gt; (who pay their own medical bills) through the
&gt; nose.Health insurance companies are staffed with
&gt; demons from hell who will withhold payment on anything
&gt; they do not approve of. Yes healthcare is fouled up in
&gt; this country,but the only thing that could possibly
&gt; screw it up worse s the US government. We have
&gt; government agencies that will pay $500 dollars (about
&gt; 330 pounds sterling) for a hammer that can be had for
&gt; $10 at at the local hardware store. Congress cannot
&gt; account for over 300 billion dollars of the country's
&gt; budget from last year. I don't think anyone would want
&gt; those guys in charge of healthcare.
&gt; The big difference in the European and (less and less)
&gt; the American mindset about government is that we have
&gt; a basic mistrust of governments that become too
&gt; powerful.
&gt; Ben Franklin,the classic American sage of the
&gt; Revolution, said that those who would trade securty
&gt; for freedom deserve neither.From the start of the
&gt; American Revolution until now we have bitched and
&gt; complained about government - ours and others and have
&gt; looked at politicians with a critical eye. I suppose
&gt; someone has to.
