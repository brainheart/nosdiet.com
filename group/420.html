Hi Tom,

I'm not sure why yahoo groups flagged your message as
spam -- maybe because you mentioned &quot;atkins energy
bars?&quot; :-). Anyway, for those whose mail clients
blocked it, hopefully it'll get through in this reply.

I'm happy to hear even your stealth mode nosdiet is
having positive effects, and that you are a fellow
sledgehammer swinger. I've seen that special
(expensive) sledgehammer site. I don't think it was
around when shovelglove started (I wonder where they
got their inspiration?). Funny how desperate people
are to throw money at a problem. 

I see your point about the Spanish... but hey, at
least &quot;nos&quot; doesn't mean &quot;crappy&quot; or &quot;it doesn't 
work&quot;
(like the Chevy &quot;nova&quot;).

Note for purists: like the virus warning hoax we got
this morning, the chevy nova story is also just an
urban legend:

<a href="http://spanish.about.com/library/weekly/aa072301a.htm">http://spanish.about.com/library/weekly/aa072301a.htm</a>

Welcome aboard (officially). Your three week lurk was
probably a good idea -- no need getting all publicly
excited about something you aren't going to stick
with. And don't worry about the pro-no-carb comments.
It's the mentality behind these diets rather than the
mechanics that really bothers me.

Reinhard

&gt; Subject: [nosdiet] Late introduction
&gt; 
&gt; Hello;
&gt; 
&gt; I found the nos diet and this group towards the end
&gt; of Christmas 
&gt; break. Wanting to make sure nos was as doable and
&gt; simple as it 
&gt; appears, I decided not to start until I had done it
&gt; for three 
&gt; weeks.:-) So I've been noisily lurking here for the
&gt; last three weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; The nos website is an example of what the internet
&gt; was promised to 
&gt; be, a free exchange of ideas. And nos is one of the
&gt; best ideas I've 
&gt; found. It still cracks me up - it beats or matches
&gt; any popular or 
&gt; comercial diet out there, and it does so by simply
&gt; putting our 
&gt; mommy's advice, &quot;Don't eat too much&quot; into a nos
&gt; memory aid. It's 
&gt; genius.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm 48. Until a few years ago I was still a skinny
&gt; type trying to get 
&gt; bigger and stronger. It worked moderately. Then I
&gt; realized there 
&gt; would always be someone bigger and stronger
&gt; (brilliant, huh?; I'm 
&gt; kind of slow). So, considering my age, I figured I
&gt; better go for the 
&gt; health benefits and get back to my old skinniness as
&gt; much as 
&gt; possible. I'm competitive; maybe I can outlive the
&gt; big guys.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried, and still believe in and like, reasonable
&gt; interpretations of 
&gt; the low-carb diets. I think most people should look
&gt; into the the why 
&gt; of those diets, the insulin problem, etc. However,
&gt; as I said, nos can 
&gt; match those diets very well. 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem I had with those other diets was other
&gt; people. My wife is 
&gt; the greatest cook in the world, and it is not nice
&gt; to say I won't eat 
&gt; this or must eat that - how rude. Now nobody knows
&gt; I'm on a diet - 
&gt; it's invisible. If she puts freshbaked rhubbarb pie
&gt; in front of me 
&gt; I'll take a small to medium slice for the sake of
&gt; domestic deception 
&gt; I mean tranquility. Hey, it's much less than my
&gt; former huge slice and 
&gt; then a second. Nos is a good thing - make it work.
&gt; 
&gt; The first week was easiest. It was so nice to not
&gt; eat so much, to be 
&gt; hungry at mealtime. I noticed I was on a diet a
&gt; little more the 
&gt; second and third week. It was no big thing. My meals
&gt; were big enough 
&gt; that they held me through from one meal to the
&gt; other. 
&gt; 
&gt; After three weeks, I lost three, two, or maybe one
&gt; pound. I don't 
&gt; care. I agree with the advice to not look at a
&gt; scale. I do - I'm 
&gt; compulsive. I don't care. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am eating less than I used to. I'm not wasting my
&gt; time around the 
&gt; house grazing. A reason I didn't lose much even
&gt; though my calories 
&gt; are so much less is I think the body likes to keep
&gt; it's same weight 
&gt; for a while. It's just a feeling I have. Weight will
&gt; come off when it 
&gt; comes off.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I am saving money. I must be. No more money
&gt; goes to almonds 
&gt; and apples in the drawer, a rare candy bar,
&gt; whatever. Since the diet 
&gt; is invisible, it may take a little more time to be
&gt; reflected in the 
&gt; family grocery bill.
&gt; 
&gt; I always work out to some extent or another. My
&gt; first link to the nos 
&gt; site was from shovelglove.com. That's another work
&gt; of laughingly 
&gt; simple genius. I don't do those particular
&gt; (peculiar?) exercises 
&gt; because I'm shoveling and pounding tire retaining
&gt; walls with a 
&gt; sledgehammer anyway. Other exercises are more fun
&gt; for me right now. I 
&gt; found an exercise site with a specially made
&gt; sledgehammer just for 
&gt; exercising. Ha! Poor suckers. The customers probably
&gt; by Atkins energy 
&gt; bars.
&gt; 
&gt; There has to be a downside to nos. Here it is: the
&gt; name is a Spanish 
&gt; reflexive pronoun. Oh well.
&gt; 
&gt; Hello nosers. Make it work.
&gt; 
&gt; Tom
