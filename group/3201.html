I visited one friend in Leesburg Florida and then another in St. Louis
Missouri. I had a great time. I went alone,leaving my husband at home to
look after the 3 dogs and a cat. The St. Louis friend is single and doesn't
cook and we ate out all the time. I stuck to salads, mainly chicken, but 
had
trout once too,except when we went to a Chinese buffet. there I filled 
my
plate with green beans and broccoli and added a few pieces of chicken and
mushrooms. I felt full, but didn't overdo the calories or the carbs, so 
kept
my diabetes on target.
I love your clothing sizes. I found that I didn't even need to go into 
the
plus sizes. I fit a 16W perfectly. I came home with a number of pairs of
great jeans and bought some for the kids too. My daughter says my son-in 
law
hasn't taken his off since I gave them to him. Now if I need anything I 
can
get online to JC Penney

&gt; Dear Hana,
&gt; Where did you visit? So nice to hear from you again. You are right
about
&gt; our huge portions...I was very slim in Switzerland, but really piled 
on
the
&gt; weight in the USA. I have learned to &quot;doggy bag &quot;half of my dinner 
when we
&gt; eat out, and have that for lunch the next day, Now that my husband 
has
lost
&gt; so much weight, I notice he does the same. But now that he is retired , 
we
&gt; seldom eat out and I believe that is how we stay on the&quot; path of 
not
&gt; regaining&quot;! Weight loss sure is slow for me now that I am older, 
but
&gt; hopefully wiser, and not spending more money on all those diet books!
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Bonnie

&gt; I have just got back from a two week trip to the USA.( I live in England)
&gt; Despite eating out a lot, mainly chicken salads, I came back a pound
&gt; lighter. I walked a lot doing the tourist bit, ate according to the 
No-S
&gt; rules. didn't use any S days and managed to keep my diabetes under 
control
&gt; even though I left one lot of medicine behind ( folks over there: 
your
&gt; portions are huge!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, gang,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Been busy, and will be busy again soon, so I thought I'd check 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt; during my lull.
&gt; &gt; .....Enjoy that little lull girl :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RICHIE! Because it's been
&gt; &gt; scientifically
&gt; &gt; &gt; proven that writing in all-caps conveys twice as much birthday
&gt; &gt; &gt; cheer--and thus cancels out the lateness of the greeting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ....MILLE GRAZIE CHICA! Please no need at all to even
&gt; &gt; mention &quot;lateness&quot; Lateness, shmateness!
&gt; &gt; You have been scientifically proven to be a cool person!
&gt; &gt; Richie is here right now, and he says, &quot;Thanks&quot; too 
:)
&gt; &gt; (but me mostly! since he don't know you too good yet :) LOL)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds like you guys are doing really well, getting your
&gt; &gt; &gt; turtle-groove on. I, too, have been grooving like a reptile, 
albeit
&gt; &gt; &gt; one with a sporty headband and kicky knee-socks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; .....You are a Jane Fonda for the 2000's!
&gt; &gt; Kick it you chameleon! :) LOL...
&gt; &gt; My mom, of all people, is even praising me these days and noticing
&gt; &gt; that I'm morphing into a more lean mean sexy machine!
&gt; &gt; I looked at myself in the full length mirror I normally evade
&gt; &gt; looking at, for the first time in about 2 months... I couldn't
&gt; &gt; believe my eyes!
&gt; &gt; I actually said, out loud
&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh my God!&quot; because I looked way shrunken!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Great to hear from you in your lull, because you are never dull.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Enjoy jumping and leaping with kneesocks and headbands
&gt; &gt; Sweat... The smell of success!
&gt; &gt; Love,
&gt; &gt; Deb
&gt; &gt;
