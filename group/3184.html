&gt; Well I wrote that to remind myself as well, but glad you got a 
lift out of it. I must be very careful now as we are starting our 
ice cream season in our store, and if I am not careful of the 2 evil 
esses.....Yikes.

....Bonnie :)
Not to, minimize your plight in any way, as having to look at and 
sell icecream all day would be torture for many people including me, 
but just make eating ice cream on N days
NON OPTIONAL... 
De-condition yourself to &quot;have to have it&quot;... just because it's in 

the store...
Again it's not easy, so if I seem too tough love, well just know 
that I have been on both sides of the diet wall, and being on the 
NoS side is what's working for me... so I am very zealous about it 
these days :)
I can finally see a chin that isn't round and chubby, but rather, 
getting a little pointy definition... I couldn't be happier!
So NoS rules rule!

Perhaps if you had a midweek S day, instead of having to resist all 
the way through until the weekend, that would be more endurable...
In other words, make Wednesday an S day, and then only one more on 
the weekend... On really stressful weeks, that's what we do... 
Or sometimes I break down on Friday, though it's not officially an S 
day, because it begins with F...
Oh well, I just say, as long as it's two days only of SSing
then &quot;F which S day it is&quot; Ha ha...
(couldn't resist that one...)

If it's really something you want to eat, cool, make it your S...
But Bonnie, if it's just impulse eating, cause you mentioned 
snacking too, start getting comically strict with the rules... 
Impulse eating, ie Snacking, isn't worth sacrificing your health, 
and certainly can screw up any &quot;good work&quot; you do for the rest of 

your day...
I never imagined in my wildest dreams, that I would be able to drive 
past multiple Dunkin Donuts, 7/11's, and various fast food joints, 
without giving in to the impulse to that voice saying 
&quot;Hmmm I *could* have something...&quot; when I'm not really hungry...
I used to truly believe that I needed these little treats to keep me 
going... &quot;My blood sugar gets low&quot; was a great lie I used to tell 

myself to justify these impulse items, like Dunkacino, or a donut...
Try to remember that each time you use a rule, and it does seem hard 
sometimes, the next time you need to resist you will be a little 
stronger each time... eventually, it may even feel like a game...
That's the way I feel right now... 
Will I win or will the bag of cheetos win?
Who is more important? (can cheetos be called &quot;who&quot;? LOL!)
Well clearly you are!
Make the rules a number one priority and a lesson in discipline.
You will feel really proud when you know that you put in major 
effort and stayed true to your self and your dream of being a 
healthy Bonnie :)
Be strong..
Put on your blinders to that Good Humor bar!
You will be very proud of your success!
It's all mental :)
(trust one who knows about that topic :) 
Hugs!
Deb
