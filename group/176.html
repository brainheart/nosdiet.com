I am doing fine with it. Eating three meals a day is a relief...I 
don't have to think about my next meal constantly, like when eating 
those metabolically-spaced meals...six a day...yikes. I got so sick 
of eating...and only eating a tiny bit. So I am liking this nosdiet. 
It's the only diet I've been on, where nobody else knows I'm on it, 
so I don't have to explain anything to anybody. The other night, my 
Dad made a huge, yummy spaghetti dinner, complete with garlic bread. 
I served myself a huge pile of salad, a small portion of spaghetti, 
and a small hunk of the garlic bread. I ate slowly, and NOBODY knew 
I was on a &quot;diet&quot;, which was a big plus for me. Last diet I was on 

was Atkins, where I had to make a huge fuss about eating only the 
meat and salad...the nosdiet makes eating &quot;normal&quot; again. 

Avoiding the sugar is simple after having been on Atkins. I have 
never eaten much sweets anyway...I am fat because I have always 
OVERATE. I love food and can eat and eat and eat. With the nosdiet, 
I control my portions (similar to the six tiny meals like in Body 
For Life), but because at each sitting, I get to eat a real meal 
(not a palm of protein, a fist of carb, and no fat), I feel 
satisfied, like I'm not on a diet, actually, I'm just not being a 
damn pig anymore!

Thanks very much. I will keep you updated. Glad to join the group.
