 Just keep walking with the kids. We would do a lot of outdoor things with
our kids when they were young, kept us young as well, and the kids enjoyed
it as much as we did. Biking, baseball, swimming, hiking.

I know what you mean. I always seem to fall into a
pattern of going gung ho for a week or two with
exercise programs and diet programs then I start
making excuses to myself why I should stop. Right now
I am getting my exercise in by walking my kids to
school and walking to pick them up. I also spend a
little time every week in my yard, digging up weeds
and mowing the lawn. I don't know how I am going to
convince myself to keep walking when school gets out.
I have 3 weeks to figure it out.

&gt; &quot;I tend to hide when I am being bad. I come to my
&gt; senses and start
&gt; reading the sites again for strength. &quot;
&gt;
&gt; I thought I was the only one who hides when I am
&gt; ashamed of myself.
&gt; My eating habits for the last two weeks definatly
&gt; have not been
&gt; regulatin Nos. On the plus side I have been walking
&gt; everyday. I just
&gt; hope they are canceling each other out. I don't dare
&gt; step on a scale
&gt; to find out.

&gt; Yes Melanie I guess it is human. We want everyone
&gt; to know when we do
&gt; good and no one to know when we mess up. I was
&gt; doing real bad. I
&gt; did continue to exercise which is good but it
&gt; doesn't seem to cancel
&gt; out my overeating. I did step on the scale. Yikes.
&gt; These last 3
&gt; days have been good and hopefully I won't go crazy
&gt; this weekend.
&gt;
&gt; I have exercised for 3 straight months. This is a
&gt; record for me. I
&gt; increase a little each month. I am going slow at it
&gt; since in the
&gt; past I haven't stuck to it. Some days I really look
&gt; forward to it.
