Dear Hana,
It is the same way here in the states...believe me!
Bonnie
&gt; I have 3 Italian greyhounds. The sick one is the grandmother of the 
tribe
&gt; and is just coming up to her 14th birthday. I also have a grown up 
daughter,
&gt; just completing her teaching degree.I teach biology , chemistry and 
physics.
&gt; Science is compulsory here in Britain along with Maths and English, so 
we
&gt; get a lot of students who come just because they have to.I work in 
a
&gt; designated Technology college and we have hundreds of computers for the 
kids
&gt; to use. I took the class to a computer suite to work with a brilliant
&gt; American schools website on the function of the heart . it shows clear
&gt; simulations, but a couple of them amused themselves by sending obscene
&gt; e-mails. They have their own hotmail accounts which the computer services
&gt; department cannot monitor or block. If I can find who started the game I 
can
&gt; get their internet rights revoked.The real problem with these kids is 
that
&gt; so many come from poor homes. Not material poverty, but poverty of 
spirit
&gt; and care. They believe that soap opera is real life and that designer 
labels
&gt; and the right mobile phone(cellphone) are the most important things in 
life.

&gt; &gt; Dear Hana,
&gt; &gt; Sorry to hear about your dogs illness. I have two Goldens and they 
are
&gt; &gt; like children to me, my two kids are grown and moved out now. I 
remember
&gt; &gt; when my daughter took Spanish in high school, and to keep it 
interesting
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; teacher would ask them to watch a TV show, General Hospital at the 
time
&gt; ,and
&gt; &gt; they would discuss it in class next day but in Spanish! What are 
you
&gt; &gt; teaching?
&gt; &gt; I got a bad report on my blood pressure yesterday,145-90,
&gt; &gt; so I must be even more care ful now with my sat fat and salt!
&gt; &gt; Bonnie

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been struggling to lose for weeks I have increased the total 
amount
&gt; &gt; of food over the last couple of days and lost a couple of pounds. I 
am
&gt; still
&gt; &gt; keeping my blood sugars as they should be.I haven't exercised much 
this
&gt; week
&gt; &gt; either, my little dog is ill with heart failure and I had to rush her 
to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; vet, which took out a whole afternoon and I have been very tired 
from
&gt; work.
&gt; &gt; I teach one class per day and they are horrible and don't want to 
work.
&gt; The
&gt; &gt; best ideas for interesting lessons get nowhere. That is so dispiriting.
