&gt; Hi. I've always admired the No S diet, but had other methods that
&gt; worked for me. Nevertheless I'm starting No S today.
&gt; I lost, at one point, about 65 lbs, over 2002-2003, by calorie
&gt; counting and exercise.
.....Hi Neil :)
Welcome to the group! Congratulations on your already, very 
impressive success story! It's so much easier to gain then to lose 
isn't it? :) I'm sure NoS will knock the gaining trend right out!

&gt; But the romance of accounting is gone. ;)
....That's so funny, and too true! One can only get that focused on 
detail for a limited time and then it just becomes a chore... I'm 
sure you have laid the groundwork though for very positive, instinct 
driven choices, with the added power of &quot;accountant&quot; info... It is 

shocking when we actually read how much 1/2 a cup of chocolate ice 
cream is! I think it's good to know that stuff on some level...But 
now that you know it, you can make some great choices but don't 
necessarily have to get too &quot;Type-A&quot; about it! LOL :)

&gt;Then I got to within 10 lbs of ideal, I started slacking, and for 
various reasons, over the summer and fall I've inched up to 30 lbs 
above ideal.

.....Oh &quot;various reasons&quot;, they are so annoying! Good thing you are 

nipping it in the bud... It's scary how so much hard work can be 
reversed so easily :(
I had lost around the same as you, 65 lbs, over 3 years, and then in 
one very extended Winter into Summer, binge it all came packing back 
on. Very disheartening and I am really so relieved to have found 
this great group and the very sane and life friendly plan from our 
Mr. E :) When I think about it...If I didn't find NoS, by now I 
could have gained an extra 20 to boot....
Life long habits are hard to beat, but unless you do, somewhere down 
the line, they creep back when you least expect it...NoS doesn't 
sidstep this issue and it is at the core of the NoS beliefs...
Maintenence is a &quot;rest of your life&quot; job...Why not have a nice and 

sane way of approaching food choices :) (not that I am the best 
person to exemplify &quot;sane&quot; LOL)

&gt; I particularly like the No S's primitivist, Tyler Durden approach.
.....Who is Tyler Durden? Yes this plan is pretty nitty-gritty and 
I think it appeals to the voice in all of us who wants to hear 
a &quot;straight&quot; story, and not just dieting-dogma which leads you 

nowhere...

&gt; People think instinct is the enemy, but that's not totally true. 
Your body has a lot of mechanisms to make you want healthy food and
&gt; activity, if you give them half a chance.
....I agree with you completely and it's nice to hear your point of 
view...I always believe that your intuition and your instinct can 
never lead you wrong...

Good Luck Neil!
PS..You last name is pretty cool, where are you from?
Peace,
Deb
