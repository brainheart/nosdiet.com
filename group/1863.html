HI everyone, well saturday was a good s day for me. a few caramels 
and one caramel macchiato at Buckys(a smallone at that) gosh it 
tasted awesome. Three meals and worked my butt off at the house 
yesterday, so today i feel great and slimmer.

As far as posting, i did for a few days,just to look back and see 
what i was eating. BORING. no need to on this diet. YAH one less 
thing to do. I am so glad i gave everyone some entertainment re John 
Basedow photoss. LOL 
My Sisters birthday dinner tasted like heaven, the juiciest filet i 
have ever tasted, great dinner, no dessert too full, damn. Did have 
a rum runner that had enough sugar in it to qualify as a dessert i 
am sure.LOL
Halloween, NO candy here, my daughter is volunteering at a party the 
church throws every year for the neighboorhood kids, we will most 
likely go out for dinner whiler she is doing that.
My other daughter in Nevada, 18 in school, fixed my computer 
Thursday night. I had 27 trojans and over 1200 spywars on it, she 
said. GOOD GRIEF.Well must get going, actually going to church this 
am. Feels good. Love to all, have a great s day Julie
