aw, but of course you know that you weight fluctuates based on
water/waste weight, right? Actually, if you've honestly gained 
weight without while keeping your measurements, you've probably 
gained muscles, which is a *great* sign, since muscle burns fat just 
by existing. Keep up the good work! :-)

....Hiyo Mayo!
Thanks so much oh fiendish gal!
I really appreciate that post... Good reminder that I'm actually 
going in the right direction...
Yeh well last Tues I had my period and it usually takes time for my 
bloating to go down...And, talk about fuctua....I mean fluck... No I 
mean't to say *fluctuate*????
When I have my period I can bloat up at minimum 3 lbs and easily go 
up to 4 or 5...So in light of this obvious tendency of my body to be 
water retaining, I'm thinking of trying to make a new S... 
Reinhard? Group? Whaddayathink? The S would be for Salt... Now 
not table salt, mind you, but just those (numerous) overly sodium 
packed processed foods.... Just look at the lables on some day to 
day stuff like salad dressing and soups... We are talking sodium 
into the 900 milligrams per serving range... What is a healthy 
intake of sodium per day anyway? It can't be *that* much!
I know they certainly don't help my state of body mind or even the 
state of the union! Well I will say that too much salt messes with 
my already faltering circutry and makes me very irritable... 
pressure on the body, and pressure on the brain... Anyone with bad 
PMS knows what I am talking about... Men take my word :)
Well this morning I rechecked, since it's been 7 days and my weight 
is still one pound up from a few weeks ago, but guess what? My 
waist is down another half and inch, with no squeezing and tugging 
guys, for real. :)
I have been climbing ten flights of stairs every day and SG about 6 
days a week..... That's working for me and I'm sticking with it big 
time! Thanks again girl :) Okay everyone, group hug! Let's all &quot;Hold 

the Mayo!&quot; LOL....(sounds of Mayo et al groaning.....)

Peace and Love,
Deb
