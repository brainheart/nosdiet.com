&gt; Hi no1space,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bottom line- If I stick to the plan, and do *only*
&gt; &gt; Nosdiet, 
&gt; &gt; shovelglove, and urban ranger, and do them
&gt; &gt; religiously, do you think 
&gt; &gt; I'll be pleased with my abs when I'm done?
&gt; 
&gt; It really depends on what will please *you.* This is
&gt; all I do, and I'm pleased, but I'm not about to enter
&gt; any Mr. Universe contests. Do I, as the first and
&gt; presumably most zealous shovelglover out there have a
&gt; 6 pack? Well, I can kinda make out 6 distinct lumps,
&gt; but I don't look anything like the photoshop enhanced
&gt; beefcake in underwear ads. These systems were designed
&gt; for regular people, not athletes. 14 minutes a day (of
&gt; anything) is just not going to get you to that level.
&gt; Would two hours a day do the trick? I have no idea,
&gt; and I'm not about to find out. I don't want to knock
&gt; shovelglove, I obviously think it's great, but I don't
&gt; want to mislead you either.

What pleases you would probably please me as well. I don't want to be 
the next Calvin Klein underwear model (although that *would* be 
great! ;) ), but I do want to be able to see muscle that is firm and 
flat, without a layer of soft cushion to cover it up 
(read &quot;fat&quot;, &quot;flab&quot;, &quot;blubber&quot;).

Regarding shovelglove, and this may be more appropriate in the 
shovelglove group, so feel free to link this or cut/paste it: Since I 
was having a problem with hands twisting and blisters from the glossy 
finish of the sledge hammer handle, I did buy a pair of suede work 
gloves, and now I use them to do shovelglove. It works like a charm!

P.S. Reinhard- I for one would really like to see those before/after 
pics when you get the nerve and the chance. There's nothing like real 
results for motivation.
