Okay enough is enough...I am starting to lose my initial &quot;steam&quot;
I would appreciate if collectively you all would please
KICK MY ASS! 
Actually I just need to do that and can't stand violence so just 
please cross your collective fingers for me guys...It's weird, just 
a few days &quot;off the wagon&quot; are so damaging to the morale...I don't 

need to weigh myself to know that I'm not on plan...Okay time to 
regroup. I have always been the kind of person that, when I set my 
mind to something I can achieve alot, and when there is no goal to 
work towards I'm like another person...non-motivated...treading 
water and very prone to going into a negative whirlwind of 
destructive behavior...Wow this sounds awful, I need a laugh people!
Lately the mere thought of anything stressful or externally 
pressuring really turns me off, yet in all of my past experiences 
that was the precise way I would approach some kind of diet 
goal...And (put on your therapist's caps people this is getting into 
my borderline tendencies) usually I would lose weight when I was 
hoping to attract someone...I guess this is pretty common, but the 
funny thing now is (and maybe married couples go through this too) 
when there is no one immediately on the horizon and I'm not on 
the &quot;prowl&quot; LOL, I don't know how to really muster up that 
enthusiasm about getting my body in shape...It's pretty sad really 
when I think of it, because that is such an unhealthy motivation for 
being in good shape...Self esteem doesn't just land in your lap, it 
comes from accomplishments, but for many years I always accomplished 
stuff when I felt it was going to benefit a (usually codependent) 
relationship...My health should be enough...This is a seriously 
tough problem for me to tackle since it is almost programmed into me 
on a dna level, it's so deep. I feel really upset tonight guys...do 
any of you ever experience this? If so, what are the good messages 
which help you remember that you are worth the fight? Man where is 
this post going? I'm actually crying reading my words :(

Okay I've decided that since my goals these days are just too 
nebulous, infact other than &quot;Do No S&quot; I really haven't set any 

immediate goal and this is important for me. I also know that I 
rise to a challenge so I want to make a public declaration of my 
goal for the next month and possibly through the upcoming &quot;dreaded 

holiday/winter doldrum time&quot; which usually brings holiday cheer and 

a prerequisite extra 10 to 15 lbs, if you are like me...I hate too 
much pressure but hell, if I don't start getting strict and actually 
have a goal I will just float around in diet limbo...Right now I can 
only describe my attitude and state of mind on this as &quot;Restless yet 

Immobile&quot; I hereby propose that by Thanksgiving I will have lost 12 

lbs ( if more I will dance the electric chicken on the table and let 
you know, but 12 is fine. Not unrealistic if you divide that by 6 
weeks, but not too ambitious either)
Here it is and so now all of the internet is serving as my 
designated &quot;partner&quot; so to speak...And by the way if any of you No S 

guys are single,,,,wait not going there, I was just joking...
Seriously... :)

&quot;Debbies Healthcare Reform&quot; (I had to mention healthcare to stay in 

vogue and topical, so vote for me!) I am certainly open to all 
suggestions so please add anything you can think of to the following 

Here it is:

1. Go to sleep one hour earlier (even if it means not getting to 
read posts...ooh that'll be hard, since I am becoming a post junkie)

2. Get up one whole hour earlier so I can't blame skipping my 
morning routine on getting my son ready for school.. 

3. On days when I don't receive a call for a massage by 10:30 I 
have to get my shoes on and hit the pavement for at least a half 
hour. Usually, phonecalls, waiting for work, etc... become excuses 
for not moving at all...No more of that!

4. If I have a massage scheduled do SG in the mid afternoon, if 
not, do it when I get up at (groan) 7:30

5. Plan which tv shows I like and then tape them...Then do something 
more productive and less couch potatoish during those times...Play 
guitar, play board games and basketball with my son, anything but 
sit on my flabby ass!!!! 

6. Make myself have a great healthy breakfast...I am one of those 
people with an Earth Element imbalance (these are the Spleen and 
Stomach meridians) I never wake up with a good appetite and just 
have a slice of toast and coffee...I know somewhere later on this 
will set me up for a night of overeating...this stops tomorrow.

That's enough for now...I will post my weight every week so that I 
can be held &quot;accountable&quot; to someone other than me, and hope that 

this gives me extra external motivational resolve.
I feel better just thinking of this plan.

Love and thanks for listening Friends :)
I needed to unload big time :)
Debbie
