Hi Valerie :)
I am curious to know what stuff you are craving from this vending 
machine? If its sweets, or salty stuff? Crunchy stuff etc...Or is 
it just that you cant handle the impulse thing that happens when you 
walk by?
I feel that if your meal is really great, and even borderline 
fattening, you will not be as hungry as to need a snack. But 
probably you are just seeing the machine and going into a programmed 
response of getting something, we all have that in us.
I suggest just staying out of that area if possible...Is that the 
only place you can eat your lunch? Can you do an al fresco thing?
Like Reinhard said, this is all about &quot;delay&quot;
Probably 90 percent or maybe more, of our need to eat unplanned food 
is just an impulsive reaction...Why beat yourself up like you 
committed one of the seven deadly sins? When something looks 
inviting it's very normal to want it.
If I go to Dunkin Donuts with my son, it is like torture for me and 
usually I get something for both of us when this happens.
It's a trap that can be avoided.
Think of those vending machines as irresistable, recognize that they 
are interfering with your goal of long term success
(If you really are going to the machine 2 x's a day this is a pretty 
obvious hindrance to your goal) You don't have to trick your brain 
you have to just avoid the situation alltogether so your poor brain 
has a break.
Are you hungry when these impulses arive? Or is it just pure visual 
temptation? If you are infact hungry, probably you are skimping on 
good meals.
If you really must eat that unhealthy snack try to make it part of 
your meal, something that is planned into your three meals lifestyle, 
like Reinhard says in the homepage info...At least you will be making 
it part of your meal, and not further influencing that snacking 
inbetween behavior...Then, to add bang for the buck, eat only half or 
2/3 of the irresistable snack, very very very slowly and throw the 
rest away.
If you are not 100% with all three of our 
Three commandments
No Sugar
No Snacks
No Seconds
that is normal...You are not an android...Figure out which rule is 
the most challenging, and doing you the most damage, and really 
garner all your hard artillery to figure out how you can make that 
one stick. 
Also, you might think of leaving your petty cash at home so you 
simply cant buy those snacks.

I hope these ideas help :)
Good luck
Debbie

&gt; Okay, I'm really in trouble now...
&gt; 
&gt; Every day this week, I've broken the rules. So I need to start 
over. The 
&gt; old diet mentality says start over on Tuesday, because Friday is 
only one 
&gt; weekday, then there are the two S days when the rules don't 
strictly apply, 
&gt; then there's another &quot;S&quot; (special) day, Labor Day. So I might as 

well wait 
&gt; and start the three-week count on Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; I started No S a month ago and had been doing well, really enjoying 

the 
&gt; structure, etc. Then for some reason on Monday, I looked at the 
vending 
&gt; machine in the break room at work and realized it had been almost a 

month 
&gt; since I'd bought anything from it. And wouldn't you know, for the 

rest of 
&gt; the day, all I kept thinking about was what was in that vending 
machine. 
&gt; Eventually, I bought something from it, and every day this week, 
I've bought 
&gt; something from it twice a day.
&gt; 
&gt; The brain is really tricky. I keep trying to outsmart myself, but 

the more 
&gt; I try to resist, the more I can't stop thinking about it and the 
more I give 
&gt; in.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Valerie
