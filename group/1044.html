If you could stick with Sin6 for six weeks (I bought it and couldn't handle it!! Got 
too boring for me) you will love the Slim Series. It is definitely more versatile and 
has a bit more of a fun factor to them. Let me know what you think of it when you 
start!!

Kim--I do the last part of Slim in 6 (Burn It Up!) every other day 
(this was after doing the workouts 6 days a week for 6 weeks). 
Personally, I much prefer formal exercising every other day to 6 days 
a week (I get the same results, anyway). I was thrilled when the 6-
week rotation was over at the beginning of June. I ordered the Slim 
Series and plan on doing them every other day once I get them. 

I feel that eating the NoS way gives better results than exercising 
in terms of fat loss. Obviously, exercise has its benefits like 
strengthening the heart and body. But overall, I feel that the 
weight loss is achieved through dietary modifications. Back in the 
days when I exercised 7 days a week (and didn't eat according to 
NoS), I was heavier and carried more body fat than I do now.

&gt; Hello. I'm just wondering if those of you who follow the NoSdiet, 

do you also exercise? If so, what exercise do you do? I am always 
jumping on and off the exercise bandwagon, but have jumped back on as 
of lately. I hope the combination of the two will shed some pounds 
and make my body shrink! I am going on vacation three weeks from 
today, but I know I will get in enough physical activity with 
walking, etc. but I am hoping I do as well as I can on the noSdiet 
while I'm there. Between now and the time I go, I hope I can lose 
about 6 pounds or so (though I do know that fat loss is more 
important than what the scale reads).
