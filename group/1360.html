Oh, I had a message on my cell voicemail this morning from one of my 
&gt; employees saying that he is leaving some cannolis for me that 
&gt; someone brought by. Oh No. Can I freeze cannolis for Saturday? I 
&gt; will be strong, I will be strong.

Dear Lee, I really have to disagree with Cat's advice (sorry Cat no 
disrespect, but freezing cannolis in Lees case is probably a recipe 
for disaster, this time not a Hurricaine)

Are you really going to let yourself be sucked into that failure 
cycle again, after only one day in? 
Listen to your own words and hear them!
You said &quot;Oh no&quot;, now really stop and listen to that...It is your 

inner voice warning that dangers lie ahead&quot; Don't just say &quot;I will 

be strong&quot; and expect to have immediate fortress like powers... 
Listen to what you really are worried about and accept it...That &quot;Oh 

No&quot; is the real message here.
Danger, warning, cannoli attack on the horizon, Run away fast!
...You can't let something that is only 4 inches long tempt you so 
much lol :)
I think Oscar Wilde was the one who said the only way to get rid of 
Temptation is to &quot;give in to it&quot; Maybe bad advice in regards to 

cannolis!
But why put yourself into the situation to begin with.
Why make things so much more difficult by even bringing them home...
This was not YOUR plan, you didn't decide, with a clear conscience, I 
want a cannoli today because I choose a cannoli, they just 
got &quot;brought by&quot; to you by &quot;friends&quot;...what if they bring you 
more 
tomorrow and the next day, and the next day...
You don't need to be the place where people can just bring things 
by...A desert depository...This is really a trap, get out fast!&quot; 
Ask your employees to bring you jewlery, money or something that 
won't ruin your success. I'm sure they will help you if you let them 
know that you need their support. I never thought I would be quoting 
any Republican Administration but in your case I strongly suggest
&quot;Just Say No&quot; LOL
If you really need to torture yourself, go ahead, and see if you feel 
happy when you have to spend all of your energy staving off that 
craving until Saturday...It will be very draining...Really 
be &quot;strong&quot; and be good to yourself by turning down those
&quot;Drive by drop-offs&quot; 
I wish you good luck in getting to your goal
Love 
Your Friend,
Debbie
