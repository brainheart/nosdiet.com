Hi everybody

It sounds like it could be any diet sufficiently low in carbs that you excrete 
ketones in your urine. Atkins describes this state as Benign Dietary Ketosis and 
advises that you can test for it using Ketostix, available at pharmacists and usually 
used by diabetics. I've heard on another newsgroup that for optimum weight loss you 
should not go deep into ketosis (deep purple on the sticks) but stay on the initial 
margins of ketosis (pale pink).

As for danger? Well, there seems to be a lot of research into the diets of the 
Inouit, the Masaai and other such groups who survive (indeed, thrive!) on very low 
carbohydrate diets that only supports a lot of the current thinking regarding 
cholesterol levels etc.

In my own experience, I feel very well and suffer few colds, coughs etc whilst 
low-carbing but I don't necessarily believe that one diet suits all. A friend of mine 
cannot stand low-carbing and feels physically sick whenever she tries it - perhaps 
the Eat Right for Your Blood Type approach has something to offer here?

I think that it's worth reading up about this so that you can make an informed 
decision before you decide to go for it. If you do decide to do it, don't lose sight 
of whether you feel well on it or not.

Hope this helps

Good luck to all 

Alison

----- Original Message ----- its not dangerous however once you reduce your carbs to 
that level you may have a hard time ever adding them back to your diet.. i had the 
book but lent it ot my chriopractor and never got it back :) 
basically it talks about how you can do exercise on a low carb diet and dont need to 
have the carbs that everyone thinks you do when you work out

dangeours?
