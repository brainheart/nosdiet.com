Hi Diane :)
I think you are very semi creative!
We should all have mugs with a picture of Reinhard Shovelgloving or maybe 

just his cats :) LOL
Actually I think a great idea would be to make a fake picture of the ten 

commandment stones with the big red circled No &quot;S&quot; on it, but leave out the 

word diet
We hate that word...
It would have more mystique
and be semi creative.

&gt;Date: Tue, 31 Aug 2004 10:47:44 -0500
&gt;
&gt;Hi all -
&gt;
&gt;I'm writing to ask all of you to put on your thinking caps and help me 
with
&gt;a worthy project. I have checked with Reinhard first about this and he 
has
&gt;approved the idea.
&gt;
&gt;Recently someone requested No S Diet &quot;stuff&quot; like mugs, T-shirts, 
etc.
&gt;Reinhard said he had wanted to do something like that but it wasn't 
really
&gt;his thing...but he hoped to get to it soon. I'm semi-creative and
&gt;semi-skilled (self-taught) in computer graphics, and I've been mulling 
over
&gt;some ideas ever since then. I know that Cafe Press will put anything on 
a
&gt;T-shirt, mug, mousepad or what-have-you if you simply upload your graphics
&gt;and tell them who to donate the (small) commission to. (See
&gt;<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/">http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/</a>) 
The money could help support the No S
&gt;website, and we'd all feel better about paying top dollar for a coffee 
mug.
&gt;(If anyone knows of a similar site that's better, please share.)
&gt;
&gt;I'm hoping that if this is a good idea, you'll help me think of a few
&gt;designs that I can play with. And by the way, if any of you is really 
good
&gt;at this kind of thing or will get it done sooner than I will, please
&gt;volunteer! My goal would be maybe three designs available through Cafe
&gt;Press within a month. I might not know what I'm promising, but I do hope 

&gt;to
&gt;&quot;keep it simple.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;When I say &quot;designs,&quot; I'm imagining some provocative text, or catchy 
motto,
&gt;or a good quote like the one about habits I shared recently, coupled 
with
&gt;the No S logo (or maybe a new variation?), which would pique people's
&gt;interest if they see it on our T-shirt, or inspire us as we sit at our 

&gt;desks
&gt;wishing for a snack (but not really), virtuously sipping tea and
&gt;contemplating the mug.
&gt;
&gt;I've thought of a few starter-ideas but as I said, I'm only SEMI-creative
&gt;and I feel the best method is to ask this big group, and pool the 
&gt;creativity
&gt;of many to come up with something really good.
&gt;
&gt;And once again, if anyone else wants to volunteer instead, speak up! 
My
&gt;life is busy enough already and I'll be happy just to buy what you 
create!
&gt;=)
&gt;
&gt;Diane
&gt;
&gt;That quote again was...
&gt;--------------------------
&gt;&quot;Habit is either the best of servants or the worst of masters.&quot;
&gt;- Nathaniel Emmons
&gt;--------------------------
&gt;Is it catchy enough for the front of a T-shirt, with the NoS Diet logo 
on
&gt;the back? Opinions needed.
