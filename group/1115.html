Hi,

I'm 30 years old, and have been overweight ever since the age of 10 or
so. I was a geek back then (still am, in fact), and dealt with the
social ostracism by turning to food for comfort. I got over my lack
of social skills, but the habit of turning to food for comfort and
entertainment remained. To make a long story short, I now weigh 340
pounds. I knew I was heavy, but I was pretty much in denial, until I
performed a couple of songs on a local access show about a year ago. 
Seeing myself on video was a wake-up call. I mean, I know they say
that the camera adds 10 pounds - so just how many cameras did they
have on me?!? 

Over the years, I've tried Aktins, Weight Watchers, etc, but found
that I couldn't stick to them for more than a couple of months. And
each time, I've had the rebound effect, where I've gained back more
than what I lost.

I found the No S Diet through a friend's blog - he had linked to the
Shovelglove page, which in turn led me here. It immediately struck me
as being right for me. Despite being fat for so much of my life, I've
never tried to dodge responsibility for it - I've always acknowledged
that it's because I eat too much of the wrong things, and I'm pretty
sedentary. So the No S Diet's emphasis on personal responsibility
appeals to me. I don't know how easy it will be to reprogram 20 years
worth of bad habits, but this seems like the most rational approach to
doing so that I've yet found.

So today was my first day on the No S Diet, and it has been
successful. I never realized just how ingrained my habit of snacking
was, until I had to repeatedly stop myself from picking up a candy
bar, bag of chips, etc. But each time, I managed to stop myself. I
suspect that as I become more aware of this habit, it will become a
lot easier to resist.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to continuing in one of the best diet
plans I've seen. As a former programmer, I think that Reinhard has
indeed found the right level of abstraction for the problem.

- Kevin
