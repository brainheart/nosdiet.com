Hello! I found the No S diet site and list while doing a search 
on &quot;overeating&quot; last night.

After totally bloating myself to the point of being sick, I decided 
enough is enough, and it's time to make a major change in how I think 
and feel about food. I have really gained a ton of weight, and the 
way my dh eyes me every so often, I wonder sometimes if he is going 
to inform me that my butt needs it's own zip code ;-) On the happy 
side, my doctor refused to believe that I weighed what I do, so at 
least I must hide it well. LOL. Doesn't help the fact that 
according to the BMI calculators, I am &quot;obese&quot; :(

Winters are truly the worst for me, since winters are long and cold, 
and I get bored, and guess what-- eat. I guess I'll feel better 
about shoveling snow now &lt;g&gt; Mental note: must look for 
sledgehammer...

We live in a very rural area of Idaho, and we grow, raise, or hunt 
most of our food. We also raise dairy goats. I have nine does that 
will be kidding in about 4 weeks, so the busy season will start 
again. We also raise pigs, calves, chickens, rabbits, lambs, and the 
occasional other creature. In my spare time &lt;g&gt; I work at home doing 

corporate transcription.

I like the idea of the No S because it is simple. I think even I can 
remember those 3 rules :)

Just as an interesting add on, I was watching my toddler (who will 
turn 3 on Christmas morn) eat her dinner last night....
She would take one bite, chew chew chew, and then take a drink of 
water. Then she would pause, babble about whatever her brillant 
little mind had come up with, and then repeat.

Hmm. Have you ever actually taken a drink of water after EVERY 
bite. You sure can't overeat when you do it! &lt;g&gt; And a pause for 

conversation between bites....hmmm. Interesting concept, no? :)

I know at my house, we are all too guilty of sitting in silence and 
shoveling as much as possible in as quick as we can. That's a habit 
we are all going to work on, especially my 12 yr old.

Anyhow, sorry to turn this into a book :) I am happily going through 
the archives now, and hopefully will be making a big change for 
myself.

Tracy
