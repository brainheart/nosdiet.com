&gt; Having lost a fair bit of weight I am now stuck for a couple of 
months. I have kept to about 1,000 to 1,500 calories as day(Idon't 
count accurately) and am obeying the rules. I exercise at least once 
a week.Pilates and the exercise bike and treadmill. 

Hi Hana :) This is one of those &quot;plateus&quot; My guess is that in 

order to move those pounds that are sticking to you like unwanted 
glue, you will have to do a bit more regular aerobic exercise...I 
think that the walking (UR) is more beneficial for weight loss than 
SG (which seems more to tone and firm up muscles) So if you aren't 
walking already, and just didn't mention it for some reason, it 
might really help...It's great that you like Pilates, and the other 
stuff, but once a week exercise might not be enough to convince your 
body to peel off the pounds.
I can't remember if you said you were actively teaching, or retired?
Whatever your schedule I'm sure you can come up with a few more days 
of moving (as Brits would say) &quot;The Bum&quot; :)
Congrats on your initial loss and maintenence of it...Frustrating as 
it seems, it is still a victory just to maintain a loss, since it is 
so so easy to gain weight once we hit 25+ years, and Diabetes is a 
formidable foe when it comes to appetite stuff being out of whack,(I 
was a raving loon when I had gestational diabetes, and I'm not so 
sure where I am now, since my weight skyrocketed up again last 
year...) so give yourself a big hug and pat on the back and keep it 
up :)
Love,
Deb
