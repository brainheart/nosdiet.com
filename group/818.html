Oh no, I'm sure he's never heard of no S. If only I
could get that kind of publicity... The thing that
bugged me about the movie (besides the tiresome
cynical/naive clown images and that gratuitous barf
shot) was that I had gone in thinking that he would
challenge himself to make at least some effort to
occasionally find healthier offerings at mcdonalds
(sort of like a reverse Robinson Crusoe on an island
of over-civilization). But he didn't. He could just
have easily eaten himself sick at the corner deli, or
Chez Panisse. I understand that he had this great
title and concept and couldn't afford to take any
chances, but still. It seemed more like a stunt than
an experiment.

The movie does make many valid points and is quite
entertaining (if occasionally obnoxious), but I'm
afraid that the people who need the most help are
going to take home a dangerous message: &quot;see, it ain't
my fault! It's Ronald McDonald!&quot; On the other hand,
Ronald McDonald could probably use some chastening
(McDonald's denies that they got rid of &quot;super size&quot;
on account of this movie, but I think it was at least
the straw that broke the camels back), and if it helps
people realize how bad this stuff is in the quantity
so many of us eat it in, I'll give it a net thumbs up.


And to give him credit, he does show scenes that
contradict or qualify his main point. My favorite
thing about the movie, for example, was the &quot;big mac
enthusiast,&quot; this tall skinny guy with super-low
cholesterol who goes around in this quasi superhero
outfit and eats at least one big mac every day (but
he's only had a whopper once in his life and doesn't
care to repeat the experience). At his local Mcdonalds
they just ask him &quot;how many?&quot; Not a practice I'd
recommend imitating, but what a funny world we live in
that has such people in it.
