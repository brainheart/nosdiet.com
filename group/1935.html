Reinhard, I really appreciate your kind and constructive letter :)
I will try your psychological tactics when I eat out of sadness or 
lonliness/ boredom... It's really not eating because of my &quot;bastard 

appetite&quot;...when I eat because I have a good appetite, I don't feel 

guilty at all, and actually since NoS I really don't eat as much as 
I would have before... It's when I eat because of some emotional 
emptiness... The guilt in this case is actually almost a good thing, 
in that I am questioning my actions at least... but when I am 
stuffing something into my mouth with my brain on hold, and my 
appetite out of the picture, it's almost as if I've left my body, 
and am watching my actions on the sidelines, disassociated from my 
true feelings and physical sensations. Numb to the food, not really 
enjoying it... Water will be my first line of defense, then shut 
that darn tv off so I can go to sleep... My dreams are more 
entertaining and interesting than Will and Grace!
In retrospect, I drink way much more water during the Summer, and 
have hardly drank (or drunk I'm not sure which) enough throughout 
the day since it's cooled off...I would imagine that this is a 
factor which is adding to my sluggishness...
I love your analogy/anthropomorphism of your appetite as the &quot;enemy&quot; 

whom you are trying to outsmart... In truth, my appetite is a 
helpful guide to me and when I respect it I always do well... I will 
stick with your &quot;war on overeating&quot; analogy but rather than fight my 

appetite, I will &quot;enlist&quot; it to guide me... If it's not saying &quot;I'm 

hungry it's mealtime&quot; I won't act until it does. I'll try not to use 

food to numb my feelings, if I feel alone, I will try to think of 
the letter you wrote to me to keep me company :)
Peace, Love and Thanks
Debbie 
(ps. this is also my week for dreaded pms ups and downs so it's 
predictable, but still very hard on me, that my moods will swing 
from real high to real not high)
