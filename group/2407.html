Looking at the logs, I got a lot of hits from this
site. I'll have to look into it a bit. Welcome!

&gt; My name is Heidi, and I just started the Nosdiet

Yes! Welcome.

&gt; I was doing Weight Watchers Flexpoints after my last
&gt; child was born, and I lost 20 pounds... After one
&gt; hectic weekend, I fell off the system and stopped
&gt; counting points. I fully intended to get back on,
&gt; but first decided to eat all those things I had been
&gt; &quot;denied&quot; while on Weight Watchers. A couple of
&gt; months and several pints of ice cream later, I've
&gt; gained back 5 of the pounds I lost. I have no
&gt; desire to start counting points again- I have 3
&gt; young children and barely have time to keep up with
&gt; laundry, much less journaling every bite I eat.

Calorie/carb counting is so fun for a while. Then all
of a sudden you have other more pressing concerns.
Then 1) fun no longer enters into the equation 2)
it's no longer fun, it's profoundly un-fun. And it's
very hard to bounce back, not only because it's become
a drag, but because all those uncounted units consumed
during your downtime haunt you. You think, what's the
point of counting again when you have *no idea* how
much damage you've just done? You've managed to
convince yourself that every point matters, so your
recent bout of point amnesia seems a gigantic, open
ended failure.

Hope no-s works better for you. Keep us posted.

Reinhard
