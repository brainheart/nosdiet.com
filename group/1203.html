So did I. I have made many attempts to calculate my calorie intake. 
It was very difficult. But now with No-s, as Reinhard put it, there 
is only three meals. It is so simple for me to calculate. This whole 
process makes it somewhat simple to be successful.

&gt; First off, thanks all for your congratulations. I
&gt; really do appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a thought as I was urban rangering home from the
&gt; hospital the other day:
&gt; 
&gt; Portion control is obviously an important issue, and
&gt; not directly addressed by the no-s rules. But if you
&gt; think about it, it is addressed, and not all that
&gt; indirectly. Here's how: there is no practical way to
&gt; control portion size if you don't control portion
&gt; number. If you don't see it all in front of you at
&gt; once, you can't get a sense of how much it is without
&gt; a whole lot of calculating (which almost no one does
&gt; after the initial diet honeymoon). 
&gt; 
&gt; It's critical to develop and be able to rely on this
&gt; sense. Think of it as the difference between being
&gt; told &quot;an 8000 pound object is approaching you from SSW
&gt; at a velocity of 32 meters per second&quot; vs. seeing that
&gt; you are about to be hit by a truck. Which of these is
&gt; going to get you to step out of the way faster? Math
&gt; is great for many things, but your eyeballs are nice,
&gt; too. The nosdiet framework gives your eyeballs a
&gt; chance. It puts it all right there in front of them.
&gt; They're a much better tool for portion control,
&gt; because temptation really does come barreling around
&gt; the corner like an out of control truck. You won't
&gt; always have to time to reach for pencil and paper.
&gt; 
&gt; So many overweight people love to take multiple small
&gt; &quot;no thank you&quot; portions. They think as long as they
&gt; take less than a certain amount at a time, it doesn't
&gt; really count, that the portion control alarm won't go
&gt; off. And they're right; the alarm won't go off, but
&gt; that's the whole problem: it should. If bank alarms
&gt; were rigged to go off only when large amounts of cash
&gt; were stolen the vaults would soon be empty. And the
&gt; funny thing is people think they are fooling the
&gt; people around them. This is almost never the case;
&gt; they're just fooling themselves. Stick with fewer,
&gt; bigger portions. Better let the alarm go off and have
&gt; it ring in your ears than tip toe around it. An noisy
&gt; alarm can be a great teacher.
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard
