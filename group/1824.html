&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; Last time I posted, I got many supportive responses. I was all 
gung-ho, blathering on about how I was going to post everday, mark 
off successful days on my calendar, etc. Of course I did none of 
those things...

Hi Valerie :) I blather all the time! It's fun...cut yourself a 
break lady :)! You were excited about stuff and started on your new 
path...Who said it would be easy. And let's face it, no one can be 
gung ho all the time...It sounds like you are upset that you didn't 
keep your promises to us and yourself, just don't give up and go 
into &quot;guilt trip mode&quot; it is very destructive thinking...I love 

Reinhard and his plan, but there is a real paradox here...The plan 
is indeed very simple and doable, but the problem of really truly 
changing life long habits is so unbelievably ingrained and, at least 
I think, complex, both physically and spirtually...So just because 
you are involved in a simple plan (still a great one because of that)
it doesn't mean that *automatically* everything will just go from 
one extreme (overeating) to the other (being eating regimented)

&gt; 
&gt; The only thing that gives me hope that one day I'll get this is 
thinking about Lee's experience.
...I am really happy that you found some inspiration in Lee's posts, 
so did I...But just take it a day at a time, don't set yourself up 
for dissapointment. It took Lee six months, and no she didn't give 
up...I think the not giving up, is the inspiring thing here...Six 
months is an arbitrary number, in someone elses scheme...If you 
focus on making a life commitment to NOS, there will be challenges 
from here till eternity, but you are shaping a new you, and it is 
not always a linear process. I am guilty of *often* falling into 
this negative mentality of making external comparisons to other 
people who are thinner, etc...I hear these commercials for Lucille 
Roberts Gym and instantly the message &quot;why am *I* not in teeny tiny 

workout bras jumping around like I'm 14 too?! I am a lazy *&amp;#5 and 

a @# *! also, that's why!&quot; This is just my evil twin speaking and I 

have had to learn to tune out that meanie! I am doing my best, as 
we all are, everyday...Measuring success is an inside job :)

if I can't manage to do this, there's no hope for me...

...There is always hope :) Think positive and ride out the bumps 
along the road!
&gt; 
&gt; My worse times are afternoons at work, when I'm prone to snacking.
...If you are really and truly hungry, why don't you let yourself 
have a 4th small midday meal of some healthy stuff, maybe a bunch of 
baby carrots and some nuts? Perhaps a very healthy *small* sandwich 
like peanutbutter or tuna?

Anyway, today is Thursday, so I'll deal with Thursday. I thought 
Karen's mention of Stevia was a good thing. Why am I still putting 
sugar in my morning coffee when I have Splenda in my pantry?
&gt; What's done is done, but for today and tomorrow I think I need to 

post after each meal. And tomorrow, I'll use Splenda in my coffee..

...Okay, with all the Godwins Law stuff before, I still feel 
compelled to mention one more reason not to use artificial sweetener 
and to stick with a little sugar in your coffee...There is a belief 
among internet health seekers, that artificial sweeteners like 
Nutrasweet and Splenda, actually increase your appetite...So 
assuming that this is really valid info, you may be cutting calories 
in you coffee, but setting yourself up for even more hunger 
somewhere later in the day...The other thing to consider, is that 
these sweeteners really do mess with your senses...I used to use 
Equal for about 4 years instead of sugar in my coffee, prior to the 
Equal years, I was satified to put only about 2 rounded spoons of 
sugar in my coffee (and that was when I was still drinking freshly 
ground Mocha Java and French Roast combined..Pretty darn strong)
After giving up on Equal because I believe it is very unhealthy, I 
went back to sugar, however I now (embarrassing NO S disclosure) 
have to use 4 teaspoons of sugar to satisfy my altered taste buds...
I tried Stevia, and God Bless those who can enjoy it since it is 
clearly the healthiest choice, due to the fact that it doesn't 
affect blood sugar at all, but I just hated the aftertaste...I use 
Sugar in the Raw, which is Turbinado, unrefined sugar...It has a 
really great flavor, unlike white sugar.
Sorry for the long &quot;Blathering&quot; post guys :)
Good Luck Valerie!
Love,
Deb
