Hi palaytia_dream,

Welcome to the group and congratulations on sticking
with it for a month with good results. Believe it or
not, the toughest part is behind you.

As for the weekend backsliding, the first question I
have is: is it really a problem or are your
perceptions just more highly sensitized? Maybe a
little of both? What seems like a binge to me now
would have formerly been business as usual, or even
good behavior.

The fact that weekend overeating is registering so
strongly may in itself be the cure: simple
consciousness may provide enough of a brake without a
systematic intervention. An additional step in the
same vein might be paying extra attention to pivotal
moments: e.g. &quot;I notice that when I wander into the
pantry and eat a nutrigrain bar, I usually wind up
having three and then go looking for ice cream.&quot; I
chose this particular example because I've found that
most of my binges are completely unplanned and yet
highly predictable: something quasi healthy yet
unsatisfying that leads to a revolt of the appetite.
My solution? Make sure to pre-emptively *genuinely*
satisfy the appetite with a planned and really desired
treat. Respect your appetite, and it's less likely to
get unruly. Your particular problem and solution may
be different: it's the attention that's the critical
first step -- it might even be sufficient in itself.

What you want to avoid at all costs is
overcompensating: getting into the self-revenge cycle.
A little weekend overeating isn't great, but it might
not be bad enough to warrant risking a successful big
picture effort with a more ruthless approach. You've
clearly got something good to work with, tweak, don't
overthrow. And remember, the longer you nosdiet, the
more your weekday habits will come to predominate,
without much conscious effort (at least that's how it
worked for me).

Best of luck, and bug us with any particulars you
notice,

Reinhard

&gt; Howdy!! Just posting to say how excited I am to
&gt; actually find a 
&gt; group that fits my &quot;live-it&quot; style..hehe I keep
&gt; telling myself it's 
&gt; not a diet..it's a &quot;live-it&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I am a Stay at Home mom of four children, ages 12,
&gt; 11, 6 and 9 months.
&gt; I have lived by the &quot;No Ss&quot; rule for a month or so
&gt; now and lost seven 
&gt; pounds. Now recently I find myself sliiiiding back
&gt; into bad habits. 
&gt; While it's true I don't eat &quot;garbage foods&quot; on the
&gt; weekdays, I seem 
&gt; to make up for it on the weekends. Why is this? 
&gt; and I'm not even a 
&gt; fan of sweets, just during one week a month it
&gt; seems. And snacking. 
&gt; Again, when no one is home I do soooo well, eat all
&gt; my veggies and 
&gt; drink TONS of water, but on the weekends it seems
&gt; harder.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I pose this question....if I'm doing so well on
&gt; the weekdays, am 
&gt; I just undoing it on the weekends?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in Advance...
&gt; 
&gt; Pal....pondering all the new and wonderful friends
&gt; I'm gonna make 
&gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
