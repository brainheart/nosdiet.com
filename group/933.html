Hello Sandra,
This is my first week on the No s diet, so i really don't have much success to talk 
about, but i can identify with you on how you have yo-yo dieted. I have done that for 
about 5 years now. I have a lot of weight to get rid of. I am not even going to say 
how much. I wil say that I don't feel as sluggish. I have the biggest sweet tooth 
ever heard of and 3 days without any sweets is like a serious milestone. I feel so 
hopeful because i was able to do that. I am taking it one day at a time. I am 
treating everyday like its a separate accomplishment and giving myself a pat on the 
back at the end of the day. I have a calender and i put little smiley faces on it to 
remind that i am doing well. I hope this works for you. Just wanted to show some 
support!!

I am about 30 lbs over weight. I found this group on the internet about
6 months ago and have been intrigued since. I continue trying to go the
fast route thinking I can lose this weight by drinking two shakes and
one meal per day and then have a huge 3 day pigfest and then fall back
on weight watchers which lasts a few days and then I have another 3 day
or more pigfest. I have been successful a few times with weight watchers
and that's why I continue to try and fall back on it. I don't stay on
any program and continue to stay at a hefty weight for me. I workout
every day- I walk 30 minutes every morning and then workout at night
for 1-2 hours at least 6 days a week. There is no reason for me to be
heavy. I tried nos diet for a week - I felt good during the week,
however overdid it on the weekend with sweets - which is my huge
downfall. I understand the program - I need to do something that works
for me. Could people please reply with when they started, how much they
needed to lose, how much they have lost and how they feel. I have never
been 30 lbs overweight, I usually played with 20 llbs, I am very
discouraged.

Hi Gerald,

&gt; When you say snacks refer to When. I assume you
&gt; mean no between meal 
&gt; eating at all, is this correct.

Yes, that's what I mean. Snacking is a more dangerous
excuse for excess than sweets or seconds because it
has this veneer of legitimacy -- it *can* be done
right, but almost never is. So I avoid it altogether.

&gt; I bring this up,
&gt; because, I usually 
&gt; eat after exercising. How do you handle this.
&gt; 

I just make sure to do my exercise and eat my meals at
the right times. I prefer to eat about an hour before
exercising, so that's what I do (breakfast at 7,
shovelglove at 8). 

Is it difficult to arrange your exercise routine/meal
times to your satisfaction?
