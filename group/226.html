To answer a few of your questions from my point of view, fruit is the 
greatest thing for this diet. I eat an apple with every breakfast, they 

supposedly give you as much energy as a cup of coffee (and are much better 

for you). I often times have a &quot;dessert&quot; of grapes or strawberries, a small 

portion that I eat at the end of the meal, though I keep these as a part of 

the proverbial plate. 
I'm what you called a carb addict. All I eat is pizza, pasta, bread, and 

chili it seems. With pasta and bread being the biggest. Toast for breakfast 

and lunch, pasta for dinner. Yet with this diet, it's okay, and I'm proof 

now. I've only lost a few pounds, but the other day I realized something: 

the pants I bought this fall, cause I couldn't fit well into my old pants, I 

can pull down without unbuttoning/zipping. I was quite excited about this. 

I don't know how the weight itself stays on, but the fat, it's going away. 


As for other updates on me, I feared thanksgiving, yet when it came around, I 

found I only had 1.5 plates (and the half was just corn, I love corn). I 

didn't want anymore, I was so proud of myself. Also Saturday night I went to 

Culvers (the only place in a large radius that offers custard) for dinner. 

After dinner, we had assumed we would get some custard, yet afterwards, I had 

NO desire for some. It was great. 

Enough about me, welcome Joy, hope you find yourself as happy here as I 
am.

Good luck

Kevin

&gt; Hi all! I am a 50 yr old lady, and I'm 5'2&quot; and weigh 143 lbs as of 

&gt; this morning. I've already lost around 10 lbs over the last several 

&gt; months mainly by trying to just stop snacking and staying away from 

&gt; sweets. I also have just started watching my food combining....not 

&gt; eating carbs together with proteins. I've started eating alot of 
&gt; fruit every day too, which seems to be making me feel more 
&gt; energetic. I haven't been getting too sleepy in the afternoons.
&gt; 
&gt; My dad died of arterosclerosis and cardiac heart disease when he was 

&gt; 67 yrs. old. My mom has high blood pressure, my brother died last 

&gt; year of colon cancer, and three of my sisters (mom had eight kids) 

&gt; have had breast cancer. So....I think I need to do my best to get 

&gt; as healthy as I can while I'm still pretty young. Most people think 

&gt; I'm 35 by my appearance, but I already have eight grandchildren. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I saw your webpage and decided to join and try out this 
&gt; eating plan as well in addition to my food combining and fruit 
&gt; eating. :) Worth a try, right? But I am sure I will have to be 
&gt; extra careful on the &quot;S&quot; days because I have a problem with trigger 

&gt; foods like pasta, bread, potatoes, and rice. Anyone else here a 
&gt; carb addict?
&gt; 
&gt; I went on the grapefruit diet, which is a high protein/low carb diet 

&gt; that you stay on for 12 days and then go off of it for two days. So 

&gt; every other weekend you can eat what you like. That was pretty good 

&gt; for me, and I lost around 20 lbs. That was 5 yrs ago, and I ended 

&gt; up over the years putting back on most of the weight. So I tried 
&gt; the diet again, but couldn't stick with it too well. So I'm food 
&gt; combining now, and feeling much healthier...no more digestive upsets.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you allowed to eat fruit on this diet on non-S days? I usually 

&gt; eat nothing but fruit till lunch time. Breakfast and mid-morning 
&gt; snack are fruits. And then I have another fruit for my afternoon 
&gt; snack.
