I actually eat four meals a day. I have to wake up at 2:30 in the morning to go to 
work and I have to take medication, it is really too early to eat a breakfast meal so 
I eat a banana and drink a glass of milk and count it as one meal then I eat the 
other three meals at the traditional times.

I am curious to know if any of you have experimented
with the timing of your meals (that is, if you eat the
traditional three squares a day.)

The reason I ask is I still find that I am not
interested in breakfast, at what most consider the
traditional breaksfast hour. I have been able to
succeed with the Nos principles on 2 meals a day, for
the most part, but wondered if anyone spaced the meals
out differently. For example, early lunch, dinner, and
a snack? Or some other combination. 

The other thing I've done, which still comes to 3
meals a day, is skip breakfast (usually coffee), then
lunch, followed by a workout with post-workout shake,
and finally dinner. I count the shake as a meal, since
its around 300 calories. Anyone see where this would
violate the rules or the spirit of NoS?
