Thanks for the support. I guess what I needed was a little self 
confidence.

&gt; &gt; I am a 42 year old Army soldier and I have really let myself go. 

&gt; I'm about 5'8 and the last time I attempted to get on a scale, I 
&gt; weighed in at 217 lbs. I am so depressed. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi TornadoFreak! (do you live in Kansas?)
&gt; So sorry to hear you are so depressed, you are amongst friends 
&gt; here...Well, get ready to be &quot;undepressed&quot; NoS is so doable and 

&gt; enjoyable that you won't feel completely passive but you won't be 

&gt; getting totally crazy about food either...The thinking and planning 

&gt; is so minimal that it's a great no-hassle &quot;program&quot;...But beware, 

it 
&gt; is a slow speed &quot;diet&quot; that is mainly a maintenence style of 

eating, 
&gt; so if you compare it to the other Billions of fad diets, and not 
&gt; even fad, but quickie fix ones, which neglect the concept of 
&gt; breaking old unhealthy habits and creating and maintaining new ones 

&gt; for life, you might not see results as fast as *we all* wish we 
&gt; could see...It is a totally wonderful plan and we would love to 
have 
&gt; your company...So get your NoS sargent self at attention :)
&gt; &quot;Ten Hut!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; What's the problem? I guess I've just 
&gt; &gt; given up and just decided to be FAT. 
&gt; ...I can't belive that you have decided to be fat..We all make bad 

&gt; decisions sometimes, I'm sure you are oversimplifying things..From 

&gt; the small description of your job right now and your age, I would 

&gt; venture to guess that the sedentary 8 hours at a desk plus the 
&gt; waning metabolism from plain old getting older is the 
culprit...Well 
&gt; the good news is that if that truly is the case, and you 
&gt; actually &quot;decided to be FAT&quot; you can start &quot;ungiving up&quot; 
right now 
&gt; and &quot;undecide&quot; to be fat instead :)
&gt; 
&gt; I hope I can get some 
&gt; &gt; inspiration from the chat group. 
&gt; ...I hope you can inspire us too, Tornado :)
&gt; PS do you have a name? 
&gt; 
&gt; Wish me luck.
&gt; Good Tornadofreakin' luck!
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Debbie
&gt; 
&gt; PPS Check out the www.urbanranger.com
&gt; and also www.shovelglove.com 
&gt; and their respective Yahoo groups for great exercise ideas.
&gt; PPPS The founder of the NoS group, Reinhard Engels, started out at 

&gt; around the same weight you are, and in 2 years took off 40 lbs
&gt; Check out his &quot;Before and After&quot; pictures on the NOS website...That 

&gt; will probably inspire you too.
&gt; It inspired me! LOL (sorry Reinhard, don't blush too much)
