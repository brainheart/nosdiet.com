I was eating sparingly before I discovered no-s.Ihave to control my blood
sugas and my diabetic tablets are appetite suppressing. I have deliberately
incresased my food intake by adding extra fruit and veggies, because I
wasn't losing and a friend told me that a dietician said if you eat too
little, your body goes into starvation mode and you lose less.I have tried
to reduce calories and increase fibre.

&gt; Thanks for the info. I'll try to find muscle control-type exercises
&gt; by searching some of the leads you gave me. It is true that if I
&gt; tuck in the tush and stand up straight, I look considerably better
&gt; (maybe only 2 months pregnant, which I could live with). I just
&gt; want to look like that without thinking about posture, in other
&gt; words, I'm lazy!!!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;My big question is do you
&gt; &gt; eat less now than before you started nos.
&gt;
&gt; I really don't have a sense of whether I eat more or less. Sometimes
&gt; I think I eat more, since I eat breakfast now. Then I think I eat
&gt; less, because I don't snack at work anymore.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;and one or two granola bars a day
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Uh oh. That is not good. That is snacks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I believe no=s would call the granola bars snacks. I thought since 
I
&gt; ate them right after my meal (like dessert), it was OK.
&gt; Alright,...I know I'm deceiving myself. I know it's way too sweet
&gt; (which is why I like them) and I think of them like desserts/sweets.
&gt; So in my definition of sweets, I need to add granola bars. I'll cut
&gt; them out and see if it makes much difference.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help!
&gt;
&gt; Gwen
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Good luck,
&gt; &gt; Tom
