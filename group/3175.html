&gt; To Julie and Deb -
&gt; Congrats, ladies! 7 lbs over the course of the year is nothing to
&gt; sneeze at. 
......How appropriate since I have had the flu for nearly a month! 
LOL... Thanks &quot;Navin&quot;! (I'm gonna name that dog lifesaver!!!)

To put it in perspective, it's taken me about a year and a
&gt; half to drop 22 lbs, so y'all are at a nice, steady pace.

.....I think it's great that you stuck with it Nate, and thanks for 
sharing your personal info... More evidence that people should gear up 

for the long term, but that it is worth it... It's hard to do this. I 
myself just had a very annoying few weeks of &quot;doubt&quot;, and if Reinhard 

hadn't been the great and awesome problem solver he is, I might be 
flip flopping mentally (yet again) and sucked back into the &quot;desperate 

dieters mode&quot;... This is the &quot;hurry up already I want it now!&quot; 

immature way of viewing weight loss. But as immature, and downright 
silly as it is to think this way, it seems to be a very hard argument 
toresist when basically *everything* in our society is geared towards 
*NOW NOW NOW*... Even the most intelligent and level headed person, 
can fall into this psychological trap (yours truly, well maybe minus 
the level headed part! LOL Shut up Julie! I hear you smirking at me! 
LOL)

&gt; It really is amazing how something as simple as &quot;eating less&quot; 

actually works. :-) Indeed, fat can be stubborn, but in the long run 
it is no match for healty eating habits.
.....It's wild Nathan, but this is actually a very revolutionary way 
of thinking amidst the sea of diet confusion most of us are bombarded 
by... Yes it's amazing and thank God we all have found this haven of 
supreme simplicity... So livable, and so likeable!
Yay NoS...
Three cheers for Reinhard Engels...
One day you will receive the Nobel Peace Prize, I say!
Love,
Deb
Devout disciple of the NoS way of life!
