Hi,

I am very impressed with your list and website and your ideas 
because they are founded on good science and actually follow a 
school of thought known as &quot;HAES&quot; (&quot;Health at Every Size&quot;). Yours 

appears to be a program which emphasizes health rather than looking 
like cyndy crawford or (whomever the latest male heart throb is).

(and I so agree with your stand on artifical sweeteners!! YAH!!!)

Although I am posting without being a member (and I will remedy that 
situation - by officially joining - in a moment), I wanted to share 
something about public archives.

I own several Yahoogroups and probably for much the same reasons you 
have, I had set the archives on my lists to public so that anyone 
could lurk and read and hopefully pick up good info.

However, I've ended up over the years, changing that to setting the 
archives of most of the groups to members only and here's why.

Google does indeed crawl the archives of any yahoogroup which does 
not have private archives and so if anyone has shared intimate 
details about themselves, that now becomes public knowledge. This 
was called to my attention to one of the members of a group for 
those wishing to be fit, over the age of 40. She had uploaded a 
photo of herself in a bikini and asked our advice about how to deal 
with what she conceived as some serious problems in her physique. 
She also included some more personal issues in her life etc and was 
shocked to the core when all that info came up on Google. (So was I 
shocked, frankly!) I immediately set the archives of that group to 
private but this particular member never has felt comfortable 
posting much more than a &quot;hi&quot; again.

I bring this up because any type of support group is going to, as 
one of the services, provide a shoulder to cry on.

Another list where I had the archives set to public, I found that 
people were reading but not joining. This doesn't seem a big problem 
except that when people are assessing which group to join (and Yahoo 
has thousands), they DO look at the total membership and if too 
small, assume that maybe that group doesn't have much to offer - 
they may not stay around long around to try reading messages, when 
in fact, that list may have a lot more members than are listed in 
the 'total membership'. This is why I set the archives of a highly 
read list private.

I think I still have one of my several lists set to public archives -
it's basically a health info announcement list but typically have 
found that private archives has many advantages. I hope you don't 
mind my sharing this here.

take care,
Sue

&gt; Not that there was much here to see, but I just figured out that 
even
&gt; that was invisible because I hadn't set the archives to &quot;public.&quot; 

Well
&gt; that's fixed now. So lurk and post away.
&gt; 
&gt; Now that they can see it, I'm going to harass the few people I 
know are
&gt; interested in this site to post and get some magnet content going. 

I
&gt; think yahoo groups get indexed by google, so every post makes 
nosdiet
&gt; a wider target. Judging by the logs, mentions of celebrity names 
are
&gt; very effective. Especially the notoriously anorexic in conjunction
&gt; with the word &quot;diet.&quot; Cynical ploy? No, life saver! :) 
&gt; 
&gt; So what should you post, you bored or harassed? If you're on the
&gt; nosdiet, or have been, or are considering it, or loath the whole
&gt; concept, let us hear about it. I promise I won't mod you out, 
unless
&gt; you start espousing nazism or peddling penis enlargments.
&gt; 
&gt; Ideas for publicizing the diet are also welcome. &quot;Stocky&quot;, CHD 

ridden
&gt; Atkins makes hundreds of millions on his scam, I'd at least like to
&gt; get noticed.
