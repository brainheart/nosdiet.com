Did you know that a fast for a meal or two is very beneficial during the flu? It 
allows the stomach rest and the body to use its energy to ward off the disease. After 
the fever has left, a diet of oranges or any type of citrus is very beneficial. By 
all means stay away from sugar as this tends to decrease the white blood cell count 
and weaken the immune sytem. Leave at the bedside only citrus, and if he craves 
sweets have him know that the fruit will help him recover. Right now in my family 
everyone is sick. I am fasting for religious purposes, and they accuse me of not 
eating enough and that I'll become sick. However the truth be told, they eat tons 
more than me and their bodies haven't been able to resist the flu. 

Hope this helps

Somehow I don't think our family was brought up with this concept...
My son is home today (rah I am stuck in the house!) with swollen 
glands and a red throat...First thing I worry about is *food*!
So, it's not really an S day for us, but I am bending some rules...
For instance, I made him pancakes with syrup to cheer him up this 
morning, and I will probably have several more cups of coffee, with 
sugar, than usual...But there's no way in the world that I am going 
to let those 3 pounds go back onto me, and I am going to really try 
not to overeat...Because I love myself! :)
Well at least I will be getting a bunch of chores done and a few 
projects I have been putting off, like rearranging my stereo so that 
it's easier to get at, plus hanging the speakers, and now that I'm 
home anyway, I won't feel guilty that I'm not doing something else 
more important, like looking for more work.. I am really a bit 
pissed that I'm not getting to go to that gym but, hey, fortunately 
I have a great home exercise tool for situations like this!
Thanks again Reinhard for SG..
I will probably make some nice soup later, but this time, I am 
dividing it into plastic containers first, before eating too much 
like *last time*! How does split pea, lima bean and barley sound?
Yummy...
I am grateful Richard doesn't have a real bad flu with a fever at 
least, and we shall see if the vitamin C stuff that I love helps him.
Love and Peace, 
Wishing all a great day/eveing :)
Deb
