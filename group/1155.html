Subject: [nosdiet] vacation


&gt; i just got back from my vacation
&gt; i stuck fairly well to NoS meal wise i ate only at meal time
&gt; i had dessert one time on the trip and i had ice cream one time on 
the
trip
&gt; ( norma made me do it)
&gt; i didnt gain any weight on the vacation .. very little exercise because
most
&gt; of it was in the car driving ( 2000 miles) so i am happy to have not
gained
&gt; and glad i did not snack of course the person traveling with me was 
a
&gt; skinny smoker so snacks and eating were not high on the list of things 
to
do
&gt; so i guess that helped too as we had no food in the car and did not 
stop
&gt; often to eat..and never to snack ..did drink a lot of diet soda to 
stay
&gt; awake so now i can get back to water i hope ..

&gt;
&gt; Ok, here are some ideas:
&gt;
&gt; 1) have bigger lunches. Much better than falling into
&gt; a nightmare feeding frenzy because you were trying to
&gt; be too good.
&gt;
&gt; 2) make sure to drink plenty of water/tea/whatever it
&gt; takes short of sugar water between lunch and dinner.
&gt; Thirst is often confused for hunger.
&gt;
&gt; 3) do you have some kind of medical condition? If so,
&gt; or even if not so, be sure to talk to you doctor about
&gt; this. Headaches make me nervous. Maybe nosdiet is not
&gt; for you or you need an official interim meal. See:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#doctor">http://www.nosdiet.com/#doctor</a>
&gt;
&gt; Hoping we nail this,

&gt; &gt; Norma, Cat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Try to think what is tripping you up. One it will
&gt; &gt; help
&gt; &gt; us to give targeted practical advice, but more
&gt; &gt; importantly, it will help you understand what the
&gt; &gt; problem is. Don't hesitate to bug us. That's what
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; group is here for.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been eating out of control and last night I
&gt; &gt; &gt; had all kinmds of
&gt; &gt; &gt; nightmares where I had no control of things and
&gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; crying and screaming in
&gt; &gt; &gt; my sleep. I had better get a grip on things!

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Reinhard is so right about how good it feels to
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; snack. To resist gives
&gt; &gt; &gt; such a feeling of pride. Even though no one else
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the room notices. LOL
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What I have been telling myself, if this is useful
&gt; &gt; &gt; information to anyone, is
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;you tasted that before, you don't need to taste
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; again, and an
&gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity to taste it again will come around at
&gt; &gt; &gt; some point in your life&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This self talk seems to get me through my weak
&gt; &gt; &gt; moments. :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; For example: chips. I have consumed enough of
&gt; &gt; &gt; those to know what the taste
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; is long after I pass over to the other side. And
&gt; &gt; &gt; when the chance to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; them comes about, like a dinner buffet at a
&gt; &gt; picnic,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I find it easy to resist
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; them again as I make good food choices.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And what can be fun about the good food choices is
&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I have not tasted this before....what a treat!&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, to all.......have a great noSdietday!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
