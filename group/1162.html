i eat so much less on this diet
no snack foods no sweets saves lots of money
and when you arent snacking its amazing how little food gets used up
before i went on vacation i had to pitch out tons of food we had not eaten
you would be surprised how little food you consume

Michael, you mentioned that you're a little
financially strapped at the moment. If Tom's
experience holds, the money you save on nosdiet will
more than cover the sledgehammer. Anyway, I'm very
excited you're considering both. Double welcome!

Don't be discouraged by far you have to go. Just
realize it's going to take a while. Make sure to
mentally budget for this. Patience is not a popular
virtue anymore. It should be. 

Ajay,

Congratulations on what you've achieved so far. That's
huge. You clearly have the exercise bit down and have
a good idea as to what the main culprits are in terms
of diet (&quot;red oily rice&quot; etc.). Instead of absolutely
forbidding them, maybe try to come up with some
replacement &quot;intelligent default&quot; meals. What I mean
by &quot;intelligent defaults&quot; is reasonably healthy
standby meals or meal components that are easy to
prepare and keep near at hand. Unless there is
something exceptionally tempting (and some days &quot;read
oily rice&quot; may qualify), stick with the default. My
defaults are oatmeal (for lunch) and mestemacher black
bread (for breakfast). Oh, and give shovelglove a
look, if you're looking for an indoor exercise for
monsoon season.

Best of luck to you both,

Reinhard
