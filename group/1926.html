HI everyone, well now did we ever get started on a hot topic or what 
and esp. before and s day. OMG I am one of the adults who are highly 
affected by caffeine, in factright now i have a caffeine high hence 
the misspellings, my fingers are typing faster than i can think to 
spell. I think it must be right that some are affected more than 
others.Makes sence for sure being that we all have food allergies of 
some sort, maybe some we dont even know about. Deb you are killing 
me with the descriptions of donuts/begguents SP?? I quickly passed 
by the Krispy Kreme counter last night with 13 yo in tow saying 
MOOOOM please. no way its not an s day i told her.
Okay a different thread for today. She had a horrible day yesterday 
in school boys making fun of her big breasts and that her teeth are 
a bit crooked(braces in the spring). Poor thing, 13,5'8 and 
38C,blonde nordic blue eyes. I told her in a few years the boys wont 
be making fun of her, they will be ogling her. Why do they have to 
be so stupid? Anyway i am calling the school, we live in a small 
community, and we take harrassment seriously.THe awful thing, is 
that she could hurt them(extremely strong) and they are the typical 
13yo bean poles who havent sprouted. She maintained her cool, said 
nothing in response at that time, confronted one of them later that 
he was totally uncool for laughing at her(he denied it of course 
since he was all alone now):)She is such a totally cool kid, active 
in her youth group at church, going on a 2 week mission trip to so. 
africa next summer with teen mania.Makes good grades.Just praying 
they ignore her today or she could lose it today.I know this has 
nothing to do with dieting etc. just needed to vent and babble a 
while(cafe.
Urban Rangering&gt;&gt;&gt; DH took me out at 10 last night to walk for 1/2 

hour.. all i could do to get back, good grief. Woke up in the middle 
of the night my hip killing me. I dont think its the shoes they are 
Swiss Masai walking shoes called MBTs i call them my butt busters. 
It must be old age, i was up at midnight taking an excedrin sleep. 
well i best get back to work and on with the day. I am officially 
starting week 3 today, cant hardly believe it.You all are grea 
support. Thanks :)Jools
