Hi Theresa,

Sorry to hear you've been having a hard time at it. 

What seems to be the biggest problem for you, in
general? If it's something sweetish after a meal, the
critical thing is to budget for it in advance. Take
that apple or raisins and put it on (or right next to)
your plate. Adjust your portions accordingly. If the
adjustment isn't perfectly fine tuned at first (ie,
you've put a bit too much on your plate), don't worry
too much about it. Getting the discipline to stick
with the one plate is more important. There is some
fudge room within the literal rules (excessively large
plates, etc.). So fudge a little if you need to at
first. But keep the literal rules inviolate. When the
discipline firms up into habit after a few strict
weeks, then you can worry about reducing plate size.

Don't get all bent out of shape by diet envy at your
uncle. About half the country is on Atkins and I don't
notice that they're getting any skinnier, on balance.
Quick drops are not what it's about. People can put up
with just about anything for short periods of time.
Not that I don't wish your uncle the best, of course.

Hope this helps a bit, and let us know if you've got
other/more specific issues.

Reinhard

&gt; I haven't been doing so well lately and the scales
&gt; show it. Last night after a satisfying dinner I
&gt; still wanted soemthing sweet. I ate an apple over
&gt; the course of about an hour and then a handful of
&gt; raisins. Somewhere I've got this thing in my head
&gt; that says after a meal I need something sweet. Last
&gt; night hasn't been the only infraction.
&gt; 
&gt; Sunday at a restaurant I told my father-in-law about
&gt; the no &quot;S&quot; diet. He said, &quot;I like the Atkins, I
&gt; lost 12 pounds.&quot; He went on to elaborate that he
&gt; only did it for a few weeks a month or so ago, but
&gt; it worked. I told him no one can maintain such a
&gt; regimen for too long, and it's too hard, besides
&gt; being unhealthy. He shrugged me off.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't consider this a &quot;diet&quot; but a lifestyle I
&gt; must maintain the rest of my life. My brain accepts
&gt; that, but I also love food. I've never been really
&gt; overweight, but there are clothes in my closet I
&gt; can't wear in public. I could use a pep talk as the
&gt; weekend is coming up and the holidays are right
&gt; around the corner. Did I mention I love to bake
&gt; goodies around the holidays
