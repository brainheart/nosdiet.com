Hello,
Have you thought of adding &quot;splenda&quot; to you tea or coffee.
You can drink sugarless, between meals. Sometimes I enjoy
&quot;diet rite &quot;pop or diet coke, if I cant find the other, pepppermint tea 
or
decaf coffee....I only allow me caffine before breakfast and just a couple
of cups as I get the shakes and hypoglycemic with too much caffine. I also
get a little shaky with nutrasweet, and try to avoid it as much as possible,
using Splenda if needed.

My plan is to start full swing tomorrow morning. I have already been
watching my portions and my grazing in the last few weeks but have
not been so as strict as I should. I know I eat more than I should,
mostly through grazing. My meals tend to be small so I will have to
try bigger meals to start off with to curb that need to graze.
Sweets are not really an issue for me. I will be cutting my coffee
and tea intake to try to reduce my sugar intake though as i drink at
least a full pot of both a day (an IV and liquid caffination would
be much simpler no?)
Any words of advice to make it through the first day? Food
suggestions?
