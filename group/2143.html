Thanks Deb -- I think I really need to see those 21 days all slashed off. Today was 
better, but this evening a friend came over and while I was making some eggplant 
parmesan, we snacked on crackers and such....So, I put an 'S' on my calendar along 
with partial slashes....it was an almost NoS day.....I really need to focus because 
the holidays are upon us. I can't let this time of year just take over. Last year I 
was firmly low carbing and got through the holidays without a single cheat. And you 
should have seen the goodies that we got at work -- the company I work for WAS a 
direct marketing agency and every single client and every single vendor sent gift 
baskets -- each one bigger than the last, until we finally got one that was, no 
exageration, 2 feet wide and contained every Xmas goodie imaginable. It got to the 
point that everyone was saying NO MORE!! Since I was low carbing, I avoided all of 
the sweets and high carb stuff and enjoyed the occasional nut, cheese or sausage. 

Thankfully, we were bought out by one of our clients last year and are no longer an 
agency. I sure hope it is not like last year because I don't know if I have the 
resolve to get through it.

&gt; Well, after almost 10 days of following NoS, I worked at home 
yesterday and the evil Esses called out to me and won. And once I 
ate one S, I ate another and another. Instead of a red slash, I put 
a big red S. Starting my 21 days again today.
....Hey 10 days is nothing to scoff at :) Enjoy your S weekend and 
get it out of your system a bit... I don't know, I would just 
say &quot;oops I goofed yesterday&quot; and count it as an S day...S does 

start the word &quot;screwed up&quot; :) Then you will be able to just 

continue racking up slashes...
I know this is not the official advise you might get from R.E., but 
ooh you are so close!
Keep up the great work :)
Peace,
Deb
