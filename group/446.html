dear Saleta,
Love your pretty name. I always think of tea as a mini vacation in a
busy day, and it is like a snack, but not! I also enjoy licorice tea! The
after taste is sweet without adding any sweetener! Great to hear from you 
,
and you day with kids, kids, kids, sounds very busy, but fun....stop and
smell the roses, I really enjoyed the kids growing up, remember &quot;little 
kids
little problems, and big kids, big problems&quot; But aside from that ,stick
with it (no S) I am with you, I have put on a middle age spread to say 
the
least, comes with the menopause, and went from very slim to heafty bag 
size.

Snacks is my problem, as eating too much at a meal never happens, except 
for
pizza and pasta, so I try to avoid those P's,
But the magnet of those snacks, and a very &quot;snacky&quot; husband who is 
managing
to lose weight with little effort! But I am happy for him, but it is a
struggle for me! Bonnie

Bonnie,
Hello! My name is Saleta and I am the lady who asked about a pick 
me up. :) Thank you for the suggestion! Wow, I really admire you! I 
am only 28 and listening to your days makes ME tired! Good for you! 
I am formally challenged! I feel like a lazy loafer in comparison! I 
teach first grade and am always on my feet, untill I go home, sit 
for 2 minutes, then get up and cook, clean, bathe my 4 children, 
make sure their homework is done, get them into bed, sit for a bit, 
then get MY homework done. Geesh I need a nap! I will give this 
peppermint tea a try! I love tea so it won't be hard to enjoy 
something new!
Saleta
