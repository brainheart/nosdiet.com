&gt; hi debbie i went to NYC on wed and i let that throw me off too.. 
not one excuse for that because i could have stayed on plan . so 
how bout you and i get over our guilt like reinhard says and get 
geared up for monday 

....Hey Cat :)
I am revving up my engines as we speak, and feel much better today.
Actually, my brother David and his partner came to visit today and 
see Richards penultimate soccer game this morning. They live in the 
city and I live out on the Island in Great Neck...
The first thing Albert said when he saw me was &quot;Look at you! You 
look great!&quot; as they hadn't seen me since I started NoS and 
shovelglove/UR... That was a welcome compliment and perked me right 
up...Then I had coffee..
I just had a rotten few nights, staying up too late, not really 
taking care of my health in terms of rest and hydration, pms 
starting too, plus a little too much time on my hands, since my biz 
is a bit on and off, and there is some kind of saying about &quot;Idle 

hands are the devils playthings&quot; or something like that... Well when 

I am not sleeping a sufficient amount it doesn't help and then my 
thoughts start to gravitate to the negative end of the mood 
spectrum, and then if my &quot;hands&quot; are idle (ie too much of nothing to 

do workwise) that rotten &quot;devil&quot; does get a little foothold over my 

mind. But I sent for an exorcist, and his name is Reinhard! Ha ha!
No I know he looks nothing like Max Von Sydow, but he gets my head 
on straight when it starts doing a &quot;Linda Blair 360&quot; :)
Humor returning,,,temporary emergency is over....
Love,
Deb &quot;Regan&quot; Feder
