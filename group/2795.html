&gt; HI There (name ?)

That is wonedrful news !This was a very insightful post and a break 
through for anyone in the 40-50 or older. I am 41 and also remember 
not having treats except when i could find some change for the 
corner store &quot;Georges market&quot; A coke and a bag of chips or some 

penny candy was special. Also desserts were for holidays, not 
everyday, at least in my household. Remember we cleaned our plates 
because there was no snacking or desserts later. Eat now or regret 
it later. I in turn have had cookies, chips,crackers,ice cream in 
the house for 20 plus years and look at where it has got us, all 
plump. I no longer buy that stuff on a regular basis anymore. 
Although DH brings it home occasionally. Well anyway,Thanks for the 
insight and making some of us look back and see where it went wrong .

have a great week,

Julie
&gt; 
&gt; Hello, All! I've been a happy NoS'er since January 1, and have 
lost 5 pounds.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday and today I noticed a happy thing: I am eating the way 
I (and virtually 
&gt; everybody else I knew) ate in the 1950s. i.e., most meals at home 

(easier to construct 
&gt; my plate, plus saves my energy capital [money]), eating three 
squares a day (and 
&gt; removing a &quot;pebble&quot; or two from the plate each meal, as per 

Reinhard's suggestion), 
&gt; and, most significantly, enjoying my &quot;feast days&quot; the way God (or 

at least my mother) 
&gt; intended: as days of modest, occasional treats. I clearly 
remember as a young 
&gt; person in a small town in Florida going to the Royal Palm 
drugstore when I managed 
&gt; to scrape together a quarter, and indulging in a LARGE Coke (which 

was 10 oz. at the 
&gt; time!) and a bag of potato chips. Those items were just not part 
of our everyday fare. 
&gt; They were indulgences, not food groups. I guess this observation 
will only resonate 
&gt; with the over-40 (or 50) crowd, but trust me, it's the truth. I 
distinctly remember the 
&gt; only 2 fat kids at Sacred Heart School, and they wouldn't even be 

noticed in a typical 
&gt; fourth-grade class of today. But perhaps the above observations 
will be of some use: 
&gt; just remember, there is FOOD, and there are TREATS. NoS addresses 

this so nicely.
