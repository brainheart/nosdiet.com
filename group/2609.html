&gt; Hi, Everybody--
&gt; I've been lurking for about a month, hoping to work up the courage 

&gt; to make a commitment to this. It doesn't seem like it should be 
that hard, but I have one major weakness--I'm a chocaholic. It's my 
drug of choice for calming frazzled nerves,
....Hi Nancy, I am going to pray for you not to crack up! :)
Meanwhile I wanted to share a few fun quotes from the Reverend Bruce 
Southworth at the Community Church in NYC...
It was a sermon I heard over the radio, and the topic was basically 
about the little vices we all have like coffee and chocolate....

Here is the 12 step rule re: chocolate...
Never be more than 12 steps away from chocolate...

Chocolate is the food of the gods (Aztec belief)

Chocolate is the richest food source of Magnesium and very high in 
antioxidants... (polyphenols)

This one I love,
Chocolate is legal, unscheduled, and over the counter, and available 
both late afternoons, evenings and weekends.....

Nancy we all love chocolate, but to what degree do you eat it?
Do you polish off a bar a day? I have two suggestions, they might 
not work for you so please, find what works... Would you be able to 
be satisfied with cutting down on your portions of chocolate first 
and then going to full throttle NoS... Can you feel okay with say 
buying some m&amp;m's and only allowing yourself 12 of them for the 
day? Then if you have a meltdown, you can eat one or two for the 
taste but slowly wean yourself off of them... Most people would say 
don't even have it around, but that might be too unenjoyable. Would 
you be able to contain yourself from eating it all? Hmmm that's a 
hard one...
The other, more NoS approved idea, is Reinhards &quot;Carrot and Stick&quot; 

psychology... Use the chocolate as your &quot;carrot&quot; so you can look 

forward to it with total immunity from guilt of breaking the rules...
Frankly, I feel if you can reduce inbetween meal snacking and liquid 
sugar such as soda you might want to slowly get to the chocolate 
question as you develop your other good habits
I like to have the taste of chocolate in my coffee so i usually 
sprinkle a little dried hot chocolate into it... One pack of Hot 
chocolate usually lasts me about 4 days....
You will figure out something....
Meanwhile I have to reccommend something called &quot;Emergen C&quot; it's 

powdered mineral stuff.. it makes a fizzy drink..Main ingredients 
are vitamin C and B and Potassium... I started using this to fight a 
virus last month, it worked... but an added wonderful surprise was 
that it really helped energize me and make me less frazzled... I get 
frazzled alot and I have mood swings because I am bipolar.. I get 
plenty frazzled and this stuff improved my mood as well. I think it 
was the vitamin B...
You can get it at a healthfood store or maybe a good pharmacy...
Good luck with your kids... See if your kids will help you out as my 
son is with me.. He's nine years old and does a 2/3rds version of 
NoS.. I allow him some more snacks as he needs them, but they are 
healthy.. ie cheese and fruit... and he does get some more sweets 
but not much... Last year we got into the habit of having sweets for 
dessert every night, usually 3 cookies... I also allowed soda... 
Well thats over and he has lost his little chubby tummy.. Yay kids 
need a healthy diet too :) (stress on healthy)
Love,
Deb
