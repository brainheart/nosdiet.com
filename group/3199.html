Dear Hana,
Where did you visit? So nice to hear from you again. You are right about
our huge portions...I was very slim in Switzerland, but really piled on 
the
weight in the USA. I have learned to &quot;doggy bag &quot;half of my dinner when 
we
eat out, and have that for lunch the next day, Now that my husband has 
lost
so much weight, I notice he does the same. But now that he is retired , 
we
seldom eat out and I believe that is how we stay on the&quot; path of not
regaining&quot;! Weight loss sure is slow for me now that I am older, but
hopefully wiser, and not spending more money on all those diet books!
Sincerely,
Bonnie

I have just got back from a two week trip to the USA.( I live in England)
Despite eating out a lot, mainly chicken salads, I came back a pound
lighter. I walked a lot doing the tourist bit, ate according to the No-S
rules. didn't use any S days and managed to keep my diabetes under control
even though I left one lot of medicine behind ( folks over there: your
portions are huge!)

&gt; &gt; Hi, gang,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Been busy, and will be busy again soon, so I thought I'd check 
in
&gt; &gt; during my lull.
&gt; .....Enjoy that little lull girl :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; First of all, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RICHIE! Because it's been
&gt; scientifically
&gt; &gt; proven that writing in all-caps conveys twice as much birthday
&gt; &gt; cheer--and thus cancels out the lateness of the greeting.
&gt;
&gt; ....MILLE GRAZIE CHICA! Please no need at all to even
&gt; mention &quot;lateness&quot; Lateness, shmateness!
&gt; You have been scientifically proven to be a cool person!
&gt; Richie is here right now, and he says, &quot;Thanks&quot; too :)
&gt; (but me mostly! since he don't know you too good yet :) LOL)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It sounds like you guys are doing really well, getting your
&gt; &gt; turtle-groove on. I, too, have been grooving like a reptile, 
albeit
&gt; &gt; one with a sporty headband and kicky knee-socks.
&gt;
&gt; .....You are a Jane Fonda for the 2000's!
&gt; Kick it you chameleon! :) LOL...
&gt; My mom, of all people, is even praising me these days and noticing
&gt; that I'm morphing into a more lean mean sexy machine!
&gt; I looked at myself in the full length mirror I normally evade
&gt; looking at, for the first time in about 2 months... I couldn't
&gt; believe my eyes!
&gt; I actually said, out loud
&gt; &quot;Oh my God!&quot; because I looked way shrunken!
&gt;
&gt; Great to hear from you in your lull, because you are never dull.
&gt;
&gt; Enjoy jumping and leaping with kneesocks and headbands
&gt; Sweat... The smell of success!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
&gt;
