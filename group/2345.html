&quot;I propose that once a week, I was thinking 
on Sunday, that we could engage in some wild and unmoderated chat!&quot;

--Sounds like a great idea to me Deb! I tend to be pretty quiet but chats are always 
fun. :) Was thinking you should also start your own blog Debbie. :) Would be a great 
way for you to share all the wonderful things you have to say. :) And I personally am 
addicted to reading blogs lol.


Now to check in for me. I've been doing ok, only been able to slash off a couple days 
(actually I use smiley face stickers on my calendar :) ). But even the days that 
aren't flawless NoS days are so much better than they used to be. I've lost 1 1/2 
pounds and 1 inch around my waist since starting about three weeks ago. More 
importantly than any loss though is the fact that the scale hasn't once went back up. 
Last couple diets I'd lose a pound or two and the next week go back up 2-3. 


Ok, thats it for me. Talk to you all later!

Carrie :)

Okay, *seriously* I'm signing off after this! LOL
I just checked the chat room... now with me, the members equal a 
whopping
Eleven! :) lol
Well I hope some more people gravitate over there with me so I won't 
be all on my lonesome... I propose that once a week, I was thinking 
on Sunday, that we could engage in some wild and unmoderated chat!
Thought I'd make it sound more enticing :)
Does that sound good to anyone? If so, lets start a little &quot;Chat 
over Sunday morning coffee&quot; tradition, to possibly report on how our 

weeks are going, and maybe as a &quot;check in&quot; day, for the 
communicatively challenged people like me...but please, not before 
10 EST!
Any other ideas? I welcome feedback from my NoS homeys and dawgs :)
Love,
Deb
