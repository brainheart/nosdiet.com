Hi Eleanor

I live in Ireland, not too far away. Hope it goes great for you. I've lost 

about 3 stone, I'm not exactly sure 'cos I didn't weigh myself at the start.

I'm spending new year with friends in france. It's not no-s friendly, last 

night I went to a nine-course dinner! But I thought 'oh what the hell, make 

it an s day, it's not often I get to eat out like this.'

Brian

Hello,
I'm just starting the No S diet. I'm based in Cambridge in the UK and was 

wondering if I'm the first person from Blighty (Britain) to be a part of 

this diet? I think its a great idea, sensible, logical and something I hope 

I can stick to and make a way of life. A brilliant web site, entertaining 

and highly amusing. Loved it! Fingers crossed I can get into the swing of it 

and shed some pounds... and keep them away! I want to lose about 28 pounds 

(to be back at my old weight), and have a goal of reaching that by the time 

the summer May Balls (great parties) happen (which are actually in June.... 

such is British logic... hmmm.)

So... 2004.. No S's... here goes...!!

Eleanor

I know what you mean. I have trouble not eating alot but munching on 
sweets. I cant wait till I no longer have it around. I bought some homemade 

peanut brittle off of a friend and I keep telling myself you dont get this 

but once a year.

consecutive S-days, my appetite feels a bit
unbridled, and I'll be glad when I'm tucked in bed reading a Raymond
Chandler novel. I've been muttering &quot;Fence around the diet&quot; to
myself since finishing dinner.

One can only hope 5 consecutive S-days will ONLY happen during
the &quot;holiday season.&quot; (This is what happened: Dec 24- Christmas 
Eve,
Dec 25- Christmas, Dec 26- hosted my own X-mas party, Dec 27-28-
Saturday and Sunday). So today was tough.

I'm thrilled to have a jump on the New Year's resolution thing, since
I began No-essing on Dec 11. Six pounds lost (as I believe I've
mentioned -- sorry for repetition).
