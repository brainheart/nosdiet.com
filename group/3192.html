Hi folks!
Happy weekend :)
I wanted to share my latest happy news...
Today I took out a pair of jeans which fit me when I weighed alot 
less...
Last September I attempted to wear these particular pants and not 
only did I need a shoe horn to get my legs into them, when I tried 
to button them I nearly busted an anuerysm...
There was a good 4 inches of space between the button and the button 
hole when open and pulling out from all the blubber...
They are a size 16 and I was wearing size 20 last Winter...
Guess what?,,,,
They fit LIKE A GLOVE!!!!!!
Not even snug...
I am so thrilled to be going back to a healthy weight... My 
prediction is if I just stick with what I'm doing, I should be able 
to achieve my optimum size/weight by next Winter or Spring...
But whether that time estimate is accurate or just a fantasy to set 
my mind on, I won't give up no matter what...
If this takes longer, fine... As Reinhard says, and as all of us who 
have truly embraced this way of life, we have our whole lives in 
front of us, so I know I have ample time to get there... and I'm 
worth the effort and wholly committed to this goal...
Thanks for being there all, through all the bitching, ranting, 
raving and kvetching...
May we all succeed together, and share in our successes and 
failures...
Love,
Grateful Deb :)
Who is on her way to being a much cooler, attractive, healthier, 
happier, more comfortable, and wayyyy sexier Mom!
Woo hoo diddly doo! LOL!
At this point I am almost feeling brave enough to post some before 
and after photos.. But I feel pretty embarrased about how I looked 
before so if anyone says anything &quot;wise&quot; you will pay! LOL....
