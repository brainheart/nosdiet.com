For years I didn't get on a scale and was happy if I could wear the same
size clothes, now I realise that the manufacturers have gradually been
making larger sizes bigger.Thankfully I am now back down one size and saving
my money for a spend later on .I am planning to visit the USA at Easter
hoping to meet people who I have got to know on the internet. I belong to 
an
internet group of Italian greyhound people. I originally got one 30 years
ago, because I was hoping to get like my dog. Nothing will make me tiny 
and
delicate like they are, so I'm trying for slim

&gt;
&gt; Debbie, that's about the funniest &quot;diet story&quot; I've ever heard, and 
you
&gt; definitely did the right thing. If the scale could make you that angry,
it
&gt; didn't deserve to live. Hanging the corpse on the wall was an inspiration
&gt; as well! (There's a little barbarism left in all of us.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;It won't have the final word on my state of mind anymore! Not one 
more
peep
&gt; &gt;out of that torture machine :)
&gt;
&gt; Absolutely! I'm sure I've mentioned already that I &quot;threw off the 
tyranny
&gt; of the scale&quot; years ago. I went scale-free and happy for several 
years,
&gt; losing weight slowly and keeping it off. I thought I had the problem
licked
&gt; for good. Now I think the only thing I did wrong was not to substitute
&gt; another more reliable measure. When I started regaining, I honestly
didn't
&gt; realize it. I can't go into detail now about that time, but I think 
it
&gt; would have been better if I'd done my weight loss with No S or something
&gt; similar, because then you know when you go beyond the useful measures 
we
do
&gt; use: plates, timeframes, and whatever habit of exercise we have committed
&gt; to.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Wow! You should all try this...I am totally stoked! So, if you 
people
think
&gt; &gt;I am crazy, you are probably right, no secret there, LOL!...
&gt;
&gt; There are two scales still in my house, and they don't belong to me so 
I
&gt; can't smash them, but I give them a wide berth and use them only
skeptically
&gt; and sparingly. I know that neither one is accurate, and they don't 
agree
&gt; with each other, so all I can get is a very general idea of my possible
&gt; weight. If the average of three weighings on each scale goes down once 
in
a
&gt; while, I'll know that I'm losing. =D To be more specific, a few weeks
ago
&gt; I weighed more or less 206-7-8-9, and when I reported a 2 pound loss 
the
&gt; other day, it was because I saw a consistent 204. But this morning I 
felt
&gt; thinner, so I got curious and stepped on. I always recite my own &quot;mantra&quot;
&gt; before doing that: &quot;The number you see will not affect your attitude, 
or
you
&gt; are not allowed to get on! Okay, I promise!&quot; The first number I saw 
was
&gt; 184. Hmm, time for a new battery! So I got on again and it was about
&gt; 205--I think! The fact that I can't remember right now is probably 
proof
&gt; that I am hardened to the torture device. I have overcome at last! 
=D
&gt;
&gt; But the important thing is the NoS stickers I have put on every weekday
this
&gt; month.
