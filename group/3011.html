hi evryone
i ve been reading all your post for 3 weeks or so and i finally decided i am going to 
join in the conversation... and the nos diet ,too
mmm... i ve already made my shovel glove a couple of weeks ago and i used it TWICE..! 
he he he, the first time was a disaster because i used my back to do all the 
movements and winded up having a very funny feeling down my back. for a whole week , 
or so . second time was better (but it was 10 days ago)..! i couldnt believe how 
unfit i ve become (&amp; maybe always been , but didnt quite notice it before).. i 
still find &quot;time&quot; a major issue to deal with, i never have any ... not even 
those SG 14 mins..! and the &quot;timing&quot; too is my next major issue, tried to 
do it in the morning but i never wake up early enough (those 14 mins are really very 
crucial for me to get to my classes on time - or sometimes only &quot;5 mins 
late&quot; ) he he he.. when i m back from college i am usually very tired to do 
anything remotely resembling exercise so i sleep for a couple of hours and when i am 
finally awake i d rather study then jump around my room ( somehow i have this funny 
belief that even as little as 2 mins
jogging will leave me far too tired to even read anything, eventhough i feel quite 
energetic for a couple of hours whenever i manage to exercise)..
so i need u &quot;experienced essers&quot; to tell me how u managed the 
&quot;time&quot; and the &quot;timing&quot; issues when u first started..
and today feb 8th is my first day as a nosdieter...! (i am not attending any of my 
classes today so i might as well shovel glove..!)
and Debbie, u rock..! u re one of the reasons that made me join in..
and Reinhard, i think i am deeply in love with u ..! so when u start looking for a 
life-long partner take me into consideration..
he he he
XXX
Dee
