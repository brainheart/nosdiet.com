20 lb. in four months isn't too bad , It's just about 1 lb and 1 ounce 
a
week., which is within what the doctors advise of 1 to 2 pounds a week..
I'll add a warning though. When I started dieting,a good few months ago. 
I
started at a steady 1 kg a week loss.(I am in metric England) But then
although I didn't change what I was doing. The losing just stopped, for
ages. I got despondent and a kilo or so crept back on.I had lost 10 kg,
which is about 22 and 1/4 pounds. I have now managed to get it off and 
the
weight moving again, by increasing my exercise and lowering my
carbohydrates. I have diabetes. and my sugar measurements are good. I
definitely react to carbohydrates, I try to keep to low or medium GI foods.I
bought myself a skipping rope( a jump rope) yesterday. I have a large paved
are outside my patio doors. I haven't used it yet. today is VERY cold for
this part of the world.

&gt; &gt; I think I can handle a 20 lb. weight loss during the next four
&gt; &gt; months, don't you think?
&gt;
&gt; I don't think I could lose that much weight that fast :) I lost about
&gt; five pounds in the first three weeks but it slowed down after that.
&gt;
&gt; But if you can, then more power to you! Just don't be disappointed 
if
&gt; you don't get all that weight down in that time.
