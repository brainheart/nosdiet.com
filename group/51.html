Hi Sue,

Thank you for sharing your experience administering yahoo groups! The
downside of google indexing just handn't occurred to me. I viewed the
fact that google crawled public archives as pure perk, but I can see
how if someone wasn't aware of this it could be a nasty surprise. 

I have to admit, though, apart from merely attracting search engine
traffic, I do like using the group as an extension of the website,
linking to relevant posts where appropriate, letting people see
non-bogus testimonials, etc. without having to commit themselves. I
think a public forum gives a welcome impression of openness after all
these dripping with greed commercial sites. I hope everyone who posted
this group so far is aware that their posts are public and indexed by
google (not that anything particularly compromising has been posted).

From a publicity point of view, I'm sure you're right. I might be able
to get more people to sign up by making membership a requirement to
lurk. But I like personally like to see what I'm getting before I sign
up for anything. So on the &quot;do unto others&quot; principle, it's what 
I'd
prefer to do with this group. If signups hit a wall, maybe I'll have
to rethink this, but they're still (slowly, admittedly) creeping up. 

[So attention lurkers who aren't signing up: please do! You can set it
to &quot;no email&quot; or &quot;daily digest&quot; if you're afraid of being 
bombarded.]

I'll have to mull this over a bit. If anyone has strong feelings on
this matter, please share them (or email me privately). For the time
being, I'll just add a reminder that &quot;this group is public and posts
will be indexed by google&quot; to the groups home page. Also, I set the
group to &quot;no attachments,&quot; so there's no danger of unflattering 
bikini
shots being uploaded. I'd done this originally just because I don't
like getting big attachments but this is a better reason.

Thanks again, Sue! 

Reinhard

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am very impressed with your list and website and your ideas 
&gt; because they are founded on good science and actually follow a 
&gt; school of thought known as &quot;HAES&quot; (&quot;Health at Every Size&quot;). 
Yours 
&gt; appears to be a program which emphasizes health rather than looking 

&gt; like cyndy crawford or (whomever the latest male heart throb is).
&gt; 
&gt; (and I so agree with your stand on artifical sweeteners!! YAH!!!)
&gt; 
&gt; Although I am posting without being a member (and I will remedy that 

&gt; situation - by officially joining - in a moment), I wanted to share 

&gt; something about public archives.
&gt; 
&gt; I own several Yahoogroups and probably for much the same reasons you 

&gt; have, I had set the archives on my lists to public so that anyone 

&gt; could lurk and read and hopefully pick up good info.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I've ended up over the years, changing that to setting the 

&gt; archives of most of the groups to members only and here's why.
&gt; 
&gt; Google does indeed crawl the archives of any yahoogroup which does 

&gt; not have private archives and so if anyone has shared intimate 
&gt; details about themselves, that now becomes public knowledge. This 

&gt; was called to my attention to one of the members of a group for 
&gt; those wishing to be fit, over the age of 40. She had uploaded a 
&gt; photo of herself in a bikini and asked our advice about how to deal 

&gt; with what she conceived as some serious problems in her physique. 

&gt; She also included some more personal issues in her life etc and was 

&gt; shocked to the core when all that info came up on Google. (So was I 

&gt; shocked, frankly!) I immediately set the archives of that group to 

&gt; private but this particular member never has felt comfortable 
&gt; posting much more than a &quot;hi&quot; again.
&gt; 
&gt; I bring this up because any type of support group is going to, as 

&gt; one of the services, provide a shoulder to cry on.
&gt; 
&gt; Another list where I had the archives set to public, I found that 

&gt; people were reading but not joining. This doesn't seem a big problem 

&gt; except that when people are assessing which group to join (and Yahoo 

&gt; has thousands), they DO look at the total membership and if too 
&gt; small, assume that maybe that group doesn't have much to offer - 
&gt; they may not stay around long around to try reading messages, when 

&gt; in fact, that list may have a lot more members than are listed in 

&gt; the 'total membership'. This is why I set the archives of a highly 

&gt; read list private.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I still have one of my several lists set to public archives 
-
&gt; it's basically a health info announcement list but typically have 

&gt; found that private archives has many advantages. I hope you don't 

&gt; mind my sharing this here.
&gt; 
&gt; take care,
&gt; Sue

&gt; &gt; Not that there was much here to see, but I just figured out that 

&gt; even
&gt; &gt; that was invisible because I hadn't set the archives to &quot;public.&quot; 

&gt; Well
&gt; &gt; that's fixed now. So lurk and post away.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now that they can see it, I'm going to harass the few people I 

&gt; know are
&gt; &gt; interested in this site to post and get some magnet content going. 

&gt; I
&gt; &gt; think yahoo groups get indexed by google, so every post makes 

&gt; nosdiet
&gt; &gt; a wider target. Judging by the logs, mentions of celebrity names 

&gt; are
&gt; &gt; very effective. Especially the notoriously anorexic in conjunction
&gt; &gt; with the word &quot;diet.&quot; Cynical ploy? No, life saver! :) 

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So what should you post, you bored or harassed? If you're on 
the
&gt; &gt; nosdiet, or have been, or are considering it, or loath the whole
&gt; &gt; concept, let us hear about it. I promise I won't mod you out, 

&gt; unless
&gt; &gt; you start espousing nazism or peddling penis enlargments.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ideas for publicizing the diet are also welcome. &quot;Stocky&quot;, CHD 

&gt; ridden
&gt; &gt; Atkins makes hundreds of millions on his scam, I'd at least like 
to
&gt; &gt; get noticed.
