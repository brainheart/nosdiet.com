Deb -- I just love New Orleans and it was a wonderful coincidence that you happened 
to post about your living there just as I had returned ready to NoS!! I could never 
live there -- I can visit for a few days, but I would be huge if I lived there. I 
LOVE all the food and yes, we went to Cafe du Monde at least 4 times -- about the 
same number of times we went to Pat O'Brien's!!! And to top off NOLA, add in 24 hour 
around the clock food on the cruise and you can see why I am thrilled to have only 
gained 5 pounds. 

It's funny, because leading up to vacation as I was frantically trying to stick with 
Scarsdale, I was dreaming of when I would return and finally be able to NoS with no 
pressure. I also realized on the cruise that I am pretty comfortable in my body now 
so any weight loss will be a bonus. BTW -- this was a cruise with 65 other people who 
I met through my internet workout message board. Most had never met before -- and it 
was a blast!!!

Mary

....You know it Mary! I wonder if my recent post about Beignets and 
NOLA food had anything to do with your new post...
