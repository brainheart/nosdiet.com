Julie -- I know how you feel -- I hate shopping for clothes when I am carrying extra 
weight -- NOTHING LOOKS GOOD because I don't feel good about myself. I am on to week 
2 of NoS. The slashes are adding up on the calendar and that feels good. I stepped on 
the scale this morning to discover that I have lost 2.5 pounds since last Monday. 
Granted, I gained 5 pounds on the cruise so this isn't 'virgin' weight. But it is 
getting me closer to where I was before.

HI Deb &amp; all Another day, not another weigh in!!I had to go shopping 

last night,looking for something to wear to a wedding this Friday. I 
got so depressed. Nothing at all fit right. I guess if i had all the 
$$ i could shop at one of the designer stores, maybe i could find 
something that looked good on my body type. BIG PEAR:( Was so 
depressed by the time i got home its amazing i didnt sit down to a 
bowl of ice cream. Fixed a margarita and vegged for the next 2 
hours.DH knew better than to say anything to me when he saw the look 
on my face as i got home. So tired of being fat. Some people would 
say and have to me, but Julie you look fine, why would you want to 
lose weight? Because i have 40# extra around my tummy and butt.I was 
nearly tempted as most of us are by a quick fix of an extreme diet 
with quick results. been there done that and gained it all back ++. 
If i had something in my closet that fit me i would wear it. Taking 
my daughter out tonight to find her a dress or nice slacks for the 
wedding. Maybe i will get lucky.we will see, so much easier to shop 
when you are thin. :( I dont find this diet hard, exercise is hard 
because of my hip problems. If i walk i am in pain .... Sorry for 
rambling, just one of those day I guess. Thanks for listening 
everyone,I really dont have anyone else to talk to abou this as i 
work an extreme amount of hours and have no life beyond work. Talk 
to you all later on bye til then Julie
