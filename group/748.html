&quot;Intelligent defaults&quot; is a term usually used with
reference to computer programs. It means that unless
the user specifies otherwise, the program will behave
in a reasonably smart way. It anticipates the most
common user needs and just works that way without
requiring explicit configuration. If you don't like
the way it works, you can change it, but most of the
time, you won't have to.

I think this is a useful concept for diet. Think up a
convenient, reasonably healthy default meal or meal
component. Make sure to always have the ingredients on
hand. You don't *have* to eat this stuff every day,
but it gives you a good fallback if you're in a rush
and can't think of anything better. It discourages
opportunistic, hurried bottom feeding.

My defaults, as I think I've mentioned before, though
not in precisely these terms, are mestemacher whole
grain bread for breakfast, and oatmeal, dried fruit,
nuts, and seeds for lunch. The oatmeal and mestemacher
are my &quot;carbohydrate palates.&quot; You can get a
surprising amount of variety using these as bases, by
varying the toppings, dried fruit, etc. The lunch
components store well at work, they're easy to always
have on hand. Again, I don't make it a *rule* to eat
this stuff every day, they're just options. But
they're options that have spared me many a trip to the
local fast food joint. Dinner I prefer to give serious
thought to almost every day.

This isn't a necessary part of the nosdiet, but I
think it's a useful complement.

Reinhard
