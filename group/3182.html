......What's up Doc?
Tortoise and Hare is one of my favorite stories...mainly because since 

I have left the &quot;under 20&quot; category, I seem to have slowed down to a 

slugs pace, in most of the things I do! I'm kindof big I guess. 
Wasn't always... it's an Earth Element thing... Earth, and my zodiac 
sign, Cancer, are both centered around guess which internal organ????
Yep, you guessed it...
The stomach... 

Earth types are roundish, worry too much, and of course, have eating 
imbalances... Thank God, this plan is helping to bring balance into my 

body, and it is helping my happiness!
Come to think of it, Reinhard with all his reminding about 
how &quot;Comically strict&quot; rules are really what help the Will function 

best, he is so right.. Not too much thought involved, not too many 
choices to make, re: restricted foods, understanding that this is 
really a healthy plan, not some weird pill you ingest, knowing full 
well in your subconscious, that that can't be good for you..
All this minimizes worry... NoS is never going to give my stomach an 
ulcer! And I don't have gastric reflux either... Both of those are 
from being consumed by the emotion of Sympathy or in other words, 
Worrying... (PS. For newbies.. I'm not just making this up.. it all 
comes from the Eastern view of the relationship between emotions and 
the body's physical functions, as pertaining specifically to the 
internal organs functions... This is the view as seen in Traditional 
Chinese Medicine. I have been trained using TCM for evaluation of 
clients when they come with illness or discomfort...)

My mind may race all over my brain but my body was built for comfort 
and not for speed! So, NoS is a perfect match...
My diet soulmate! :)
Oh incidentally, I am officially down around another pound since 
mehhh,,,,, about 2 weeks ago and a whole inch and a half has come off 
of my stubborn belly fat, since January! My &quot;fat pants&quot; I bought last 

Fall, are really looking huge... You know, like that picture of Sambo 
from last years posts... Hey Sambo! Still with the group :)?
Let's hear it! It's my birthday! Oh Baby!
I'm rockin!
Hoo hoo!
LOL..

&gt; My weight loss has been slow, perhaps because of my evening 
popsicle, which is sometimes jello or yogurt, but at least it is going 

down, not up, and it took a long time to creep on, and is taking a
long time to creep off, but off and gone forever it is....Viva La Non 
S! Bonnie
.....Right on Bonners!
Three cheers for the Bonneroo!
You know Bonnie, I bet if you started to do a little shovelglove, and 
you cut your evening popsicle down to only 2 a week, that weight loss 
wouldn't be as excruciatingly slow... Just a little idea.. Feel free 
to say &quot;bollocks&quot; if you don't wish to change your routine...
The weather is really starting to be nice... Getting out for a daily 
Urban Ranger outing is what I am making my goal.. I have been 
struggling like a freakin pneumonia case these days, so I get a bit 
too winded to do extended activity... but it's definitely clearing up 
gradually... Got a wonderful adjustment from my angel partner Robert..
I couldn't even Shovelglove much this week... Just 2 days out of 4...
I'm a little sore up there, since he released a lot of fixation, and 
my muscles were like reenforced steel bars.. I think I'll be at it 
tonight. Richard is dying to go and play at the park.. So we will be 
walking this weekend and I think by next week I should be able to 
figure out a walking errand I can do every day...
By the time Summer rolls around, and gas is up to 3 bucks a gallon..
I think Urban Ranger will go Nationwide...
Reinhard. You may just be that next Moses, leading leagues of Rangers 
out of oil-bound bondage!
Peace and a happy day all :)
Debster
