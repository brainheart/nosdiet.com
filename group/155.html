Hi Bonnie,

You can go up a pound just by having breakfast or
drinking a tall glass of water or because your scale
is in a bad mood. I wouldn't worry about such tiny
fluctuations. 

The nosdiet is long term. Progress is slow, but
maintainable. It's a marathon, not a sprint. I didn't
look at a scale much until I was a couple months into
it. You don't want to sabotage your efforts by
quick-fix expectations.

I don't do anything except no-s, and though there's no
reason you couldn't hedge your bets with another
system as well, most people won't need to. Hold out,
and reinforcements will come. Here's what I mean:

The literal rules are effective in themselves. You
will eat less than before and you will lose weight,
maybe even right away. But the unconscious side
effects are just as important, and they can take a few
weeks to kick in. The literal rules train your body
and your appetite. The habits you build on weekdays
will start to carry over into the weekends. Your
appetite will become accustomed to eating less, and
your S-days will become less excessive. You'll also
come to have a much better understanding of what a
decent &quot;first&quot; consists of. Your portions will get
smaller, without much conscious effect. 

Skeptical? I understand. When I started, I thought
&quot;that sounds rational, but it doesn't apply to me. My
appetite is just too enormous.&quot; I assumed the literal
rules were as good as I could hope to do, shrugged my
shoulders, and figured I'd take what I could get.
Losing some weight in a maintainable way is better
than continuing to gain weight, after all. But to my
surprise, my appetite did decrease, and I went on to
lose a lot of weight. 

My wife recently looked at my plate during an s-day
dinner and exclaimed in astonishment &quot;you don't eat
that much anymore!&quot; I hadn't been putting on any kind
of special show, and hadn't much thought about what I
was doing, so I took it as a great complement.

Hope this helps,

Reinhard

&gt; 
&gt; I was the one who said thank God that I got to go
&gt; out for breakfast,(because
&gt; 
&gt; it was an s day) because then I could eat things
&gt; like pan cakes, French
&gt; toast, 
&gt; etc., not that I have to go out for that, that is
&gt; just what we did that 
&gt; morning. Also, I am doing a low carorie diet along
&gt; with the nosdiet, so I
&gt; use the 
&gt; rules for the no s, on my low calorie diet. So I can
&gt; have hash browns,
&gt; biscuits 
&gt; and gravy too. So my &quot;s&quot; days allow me to do even
&gt; more than I could if I
&gt; were 
&gt; only on the no s diet.
&gt; Stick in there, it works!
