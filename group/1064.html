I think that is what I will like about this - we ended up going out for dinner last 
night, and I had a big oriental chicken salad. It was delicious and I didn't feel 
guilty afterwards about how &quot;bad&quot; the dressing probably was and the fact 
that the chicken wasn't grilled.

&gt; good job kim 
&gt; 
&gt; yes you dont feel so deprived eating what you want for the three meals 

&gt; 
&gt; yesterday i had a plate of leftovers from our cook out and guess what i 

&gt; still lost weight eating potato salad and baked beans go figure 
&gt; 
&gt; even with family and guests you should be able 
&gt; 
&gt; to stick to three meals a day and just eat 
&gt; 
&gt; one serving ...seems to work for me and i 
&gt; 
&gt; am happy with it 
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Congratulations on the 10 lb. loss!! How long did it take you to 

&gt; 
&gt; lose it? The No &quot;S&quot; starts today for me. It will be a little bit 

&gt; 
&gt; harder because my parents surprised the whole family (they live in 

&gt; 
&gt; Florida, we live in Michigan) and came up to the family party on 
&gt; 
&gt; Saturday. Just strolled right in!! ;-) Anyhow, they are here for a 

&gt; 
&gt; week so there will be lots of family get togethers this week. I will 

&gt; 
&gt; just need to be more conscious of what I eat when, etc.

&gt; Thank you 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; it has been two to two and a half months now.( maybe three i would 

&gt; 
&gt; have to go back and look). i am not tracking that closely.. and only 

&gt; 
&gt; weighing myself every few weeks. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am not counting calories, worrying about carbs, figuring out my 

&gt; 
&gt; foodgroups or weighing foods. WHAT A BONUS! I still eat some 
&gt; 
&gt; desserts like yogurt with stuff stirred in.. or fruit dipped in 
&gt; 
&gt; peanutbutter. Yeah i slip from time to time, but my body is getting 

&gt; 
&gt; very use to three squares a day and some walking. Healthier food 
&gt; 
&gt; choices are starting to come more naturally too. It is not as if i do 

&gt; 
&gt; not like healthy food it is just that unhealthy stuff was always at 

&gt; 
&gt; the ready before. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Tonight i even went to a buffet and only had one plate. It was a 
&gt; 
&gt; large plate, but i only had one, and avoided the fried foods.... and 

&gt; 
&gt; skipped the dessert table that came with the price of the meal.. a 

&gt; 
&gt; big thing for a penny pincher like me. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; good luck this week kim
