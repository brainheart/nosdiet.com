Hi Jackie,

I'm not a huge fan of concoctions like slim fast, but
I think it falls in the realm of &quot;borderline&quot; foods
which you really need to assess on a personal basis.
I'd cut it out, and am suspicious of it's health
impact, but if it helps you toe the line otherwise and
you're not drinking gallons of it every day, I guess
it could be ok. Even if it doesn't actually contain a
whole lot of sugar, the fact that it tastes so sweet
can confuse the habit forming portion of your brain.

I just did a search on &quot;slim fast sugar content&quot; and
though I didn't get precise numbers (I'm sure you can
get these on the side of the can) the consensus does
seem to be that it's pretty high. I don't want to
sound like the pope speaking ex cathedra, but I'd
strongly consider cutting it out...

As for sugar free &quot;dessert,&quot; there's one obvious
candidate: fruit. I know you husband will probably
groan to hear me recommend it, but I wasn't a huge
fruit fan before the nosdiet either, and it's amazing
what a revelation fruit is when it's the sweetest
thing you can eat. It's what your sweet tooth was
designed for, after all. 

The tricky thing about fruit is that it's so hit or
miss. It's not like a mcdonalds big mac, which is the
same in Tokyo and Baton Rouge. It takes a few month to
get your fruit selection skills up to snuff, but it's
worth it. I've find a pretty reliable rule of thumb is
buy what's on sale, since that's probably what's in
season and therefore tastiest (I wish other products
worked this way!).

I also buy small quantities to eat within the next day
or two or three and keep them in a conspicuous,
unrefrigerated place (I call it my &quot;fruit shrine&quot;) so
I can't overlook them. If something's lousy, I don't
make myself eat it. Better to &quot;waste&quot; one piece of
fruit than force feed and develop an aversion to all
fruits of that kind. I haven't bought a ton, so it's
no big deal. I just won't buy more. If something's
good, I'm back at the store the next day.

I know fruit can't really replace waffles and cookies
and cake, but you don't have to completely replace
them -- just during the week. And that, I think it can
do. And it's ridiculously healthy etc. etc.

Good luck to you are your husband and thanks for your
post,

Reinhard

&gt; My name is Jackie, and I have just a few short
&gt; questions. Before I started 
&gt; this nosdiet, just a few days ago, I was on a low
&gt; calorie diet befor this, and 
&gt; sort of still am. (but I love the &quot;except for days
&gt; that start with S thing!) 
&gt; ha!, Except now I need to know, is slim fast for
&gt; breakfast out? Not that I mind 
&gt; or anything, just need to know sense it is sweet.
&gt; And my husband also is on 
&gt; this diet, and he was wanting to know about &quot;no
&gt; sugar&quot; deserts. I really don't 
&gt; have a problem not eating for breakfast or lunch,
&gt; but I know I need to eat 
&gt; something, that is sort of why the slim fast was
&gt; working for me. Although how 
&gt; about the breakfast hot pocket sort of things? I
&gt; don't have a clue what I'm doing. 
&gt; HELP!
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jackie
