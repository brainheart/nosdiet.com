Hi Friends :)
Today, since *that* &quot;time of the month is now over, and my body is 

not so bloated from water retention, I decided to take stock and 
compare my weight again...Weighing during or before a womans monthly 
cycle should be a &quot;No S&quot;,,,,No Scale....It is such a 
misrepresentation and a downer...

Previously (during that &quot;dark&quot; and desperate week where I told you 

guys my mind took a NoS sabbatical) of *course* my feelings mental 
and physical were, no doubt, sculpted by PMS. I had actually 
registered a 5 lb gain, somewhat pissing me off because I lost 6 lbs 
altogether....So now that I'm fortunately past that I am down 3 
more. What a number three pounds of unwanted bloating can do to 
your head, it totally had me on edge.

The good thing is I didn't give up, and can't see that as an option 
since No S has so much to offer my life :) So again, thanks to all 
my friends and especially Reinhard for that &quot;Breaking out of jail&quot; 

analogy, always the great coach, you know just what to say :) That 
time could have so easily become a binge/gain trap. Thanks for 
helping me stay on the sunny side of the slope :)
I am holding at 4lbs lost and still heading forward and &quot;downward&quot; 

into the future :)
Love and No S good vibes!
Debbie
