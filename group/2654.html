Hey people how's it hanging? :)
Okay, here I go again... I managed to have a great first week and a 
really sketchy one last week, in my attempt at 3 great weeks in 
succession... So I give myself a B+ and a new class is beginning 
today.
We had a virus last week and Richard had symptoms from Wednesday 
till Monday... So, we were really home quite a lot more than normal, 
even for Winter... I had one official &quot;sick day&quot; last week and 

yesterday was just a boring stressful day at home so by the time 
evening came I overate and paid the price...It's funny because, at 
this point, if I have a real overeating session, I feel like I am 
going to exploded! It wasn't even that much! Just half a bag of 
microwave popcorn and, of all weird foods,,, a bowl of lima beans 
with some tomato sauce! Talk about weird! LOL :) ... Well, things 
have been getting pretty bad with power struggles and incessant 
conflict between mom and I... My practice is building so slowly and 
I am not self sufficient yet, so it's a bad Catch 22, and as much as 
I would like to move out, at the moment it just isn't at all 
possible...I'm working on it though, and I hope we can move sometime 
really soon...It's very frustrating to say the least. I know that I 
wouldn't have eaten the way I did if I wasn't seeking some &quot;comfort&quot; 

and relief from this totally disfunctional relationship... It was an 
unhealthy motive to eat and it wasn't even enjoyable... Who could 
believe that &quot;snacks&quot; have turned into something *unenjoyable*? 

(hey maybe they never were and I was simply eating in some sort of 
food coma!) By the time bedtime rolled around, I was still really 
stressed, and the &quot;old&quot; me would have continued to binge, regardless 

of hunger or fullness, but I am really happy and proud to say that 
even when I could have reverted back to my old destructive 
behaviour, I chose to grab some water, stir in a little of my new 
wonder-elixir &quot;Emergen C&quot; (just vitamins and potassium...) and I 

went to bed... So as disgusting as I felt physically from being 
stuffed, I embrace that experience wholeheartedly because it was a 
great lesson and one in which I was able to be both &quot;unconscious 
eating out of stress old me&quot; and, the same time &quot;new me&quot; looking 

almost as if from the sidelines of a bad football game... Wanting 
those new habits to pulverize the old ones...Well they are really 
coming along, and next time I will try to remember how great it 
feels to be able to go to sleep knowing I did my best...Being inside 
for the cold months is such a trap... It gets pretty boring even 
when you try to occupy the time, so this is really up against me 
too...
Anyway, I think I did pretty well overall and had 7 good N days out 
of a potential 10 for two weeks... I still have SG'ed (except on 
the &quot;sick&quot; day) and I am going to start today, to slash out 10 fresh 

N days... Yes theres a break here guys, so call it what you will, 
but I feel so happy that my momentum isn't simply crushed and I am 
not demoralized at all, that I want to be nice and give myself 
credit for, at least a great first week....So I'll let you know how 
it all goes in a week or two :)
Good Luck to all my amigos! Old and New :)
Peace and Love,
Deb
