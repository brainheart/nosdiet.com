Thanks for the reminder, Reinhard. I forgot to post my &quot;journal&quot;
from last week. This is not a particularly typical week. I had a
lot of left-overs I was eating. I didn't keep track of last weekend.
I was out of town and ended up snacking a lot because I just didn't
get to sit down for too many meals. Anyhow, there weren't too many
interesting snacks over the weekend. I did have a couple of
ice-creams though. It was a darned hot weekend!

Oh, I also kept track of caloric drinks. If I would drink straight
black coffee, I'd probably cut down on the fat/calorie intake b/c I
have lattes everyday. Should also cut those out b/c they're pricey.
Ack... addictions!
