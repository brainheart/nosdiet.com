&gt; Debbie, that's about the funniest &quot;diet story&quot; I've ever heard, 

and you definitely did the right thing. If the scale could make you 
that angry, it didn't deserve to live.

....Yes it's dead now! Finally! And it didn't feel a thing :)
I'm glad to have provided some amusement, but in all seriousness, 
this was really liberating, and I feel very happy I did it, and a 
major sigh of relief...

Hanging the corpse on the wall was an inspiration 
as well! (There's a little barbarism left in all of us.)
....Ooooh there was a *lot* in me yesterday... I would go so far as 
to describe it as unfiltered rage! It's funny, now that the scale 
is hanging on my wall, when I look at it, all mangled and missing 
it's dial, empty, voicless, I really feel like smiling...This was 
something that I never did before when I looked at it. *Even* when I 
would lose weight and it showed me a number I &quot;liked&quot;, I guess I 

didn't like the fact that I was &quot;answering to it&quot; or under it's 

control...I'm telling you man, you should go out and buy a cheap 
scale and a sledgehammer, just to feel how good it is to smash it up!
(Or smash your moms when shes not looking and just blame an elephant 
for stepping on it when you were out shopping!)
Oops gotta run now
Peace,
Deb
