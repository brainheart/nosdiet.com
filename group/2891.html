&gt; I have not been able to NoS this past week! I don't know why! I 
feel like I'm testing myself, or self-sabotaging, because I was so 
happy during the first honeymoon period.... I just have to get this 
out there -- maybe it will help. What's wrong with me??? 

....Hi Not Easily Led :) That's a strange name! :)
From the sound of it, you are probably not too happy to be &quot;told 
what to do&quot; and maybe you are a bit of a rebel, eh?.. I don't really 

think any of us like being told what and what not to do or to eat 
very much... and there's a rebel in all of us saying &quot;I will do 
whatever I damn well please, so (diet) shut up and leave me alone&quot;
It is really &quot;crazy&quot; as you know, since we are only hurting 
ourselves and not really making a stand against anyone but *us*!
Rules are meant to be broken, but habits are hard to break... if you 
try to stop thinking interms of &quot;breaking rules&quot; and &quot;cheating&quot; 
and 
you redirect your thinking to say &quot;this is a habit I wan't to 
change&quot; you will be gearing up for long term success... 
The Honeymoon ends eventually for all plans which rely only on 
immediate satisfaction and gratification...it might be two weeks 
into it, or maybe two years into it... one way or another, unless 
you really love those &quot;crazy&quot; habits so much that you can't live 

without them, I suggest you take a little of the pressure off your 
performance and start to focus on your true inner beliefs...


&gt; But if I don't get off the self-sabotage trail, who knows where 
this will end.
.....You know where it will end.. more misery and self loathing, 
instead of self LOVING :)

&gt; I just want to regain my footing, and not my weight.
Thanks for listening -- I feel slightly better already.
.....See, you know the answer :) Get up on your good foot now and 
start again... once you realize that fighting yourself is taking all 
the life out of you, you may not feel the need to fight anymore..
PS.. I went through about one month of total rebellion when we were 
all &quot;Slashing&quot; days on habit... I decided that I felt that this way 

of tracking was too much of an admission of my &quot;bad&quot; days as well as 

my good ones...and after a while I didn't even want to do any 
diet... but it was too late!
My habits had already changed for the better...
Just keep doing it doing it doing it!!!
Love,
Too easily led
Deb
