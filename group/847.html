&gt; 
&gt; just might be for real.....sounds good now.

&gt; Hello All from beautiful, hot, and food loving New
&gt; Orleans. I 
&gt; started the nosdiet a few days ago and was amazed. 
&gt; I never really 
&gt; stopped to think how much food I was putting in my
&gt; mouth all day 
&gt; long. A piece of bacon after making bacon and
&gt; waiting for the eggs 
&gt; to cook before serving breakfast. Grazing before
&gt; lunch. Lunch, save 
&gt; some leftovers from lunch, eat leftovers an hour or
&gt; so later. More 
&gt; grazing, a slice of cheese, a brownie with my
&gt; afternoon tea. Bites 
&gt; of supper while I am cooking. Then the real grazing
&gt; begins! Night 
&gt; snacks, popcorn, leftover supper bites, I realize I
&gt; am just 
&gt; constantly eating, probably the equivelent of
&gt; another whole meal, 
&gt; maybe more. I have to stop myself as the food is
&gt; heading towards my 
&gt; mouth because it's so ingrained. I just started so
&gt; I haven't had a 
&gt; weekly weigh in to see if I've lost weight, but I
&gt; can already tell I 
&gt; am eating less food just giving up all the bites,
&gt; tastes, nibbles, 
&gt; and snacks.
&gt; 
&gt; Nice to meet you all:)
&gt; 
&gt; Becky

Becky,

I still can't get over the shock of how much I used to
eat, and it's been over two years. There's no magic to
this system: eat less and lose weight. Be patient,
because it's slow; but be confident, because it makes
such obvious sense. The only trick is sticking with
it, and the best way to stay motivated do that is to
consider the alternatives. You might think that,
living in a town so justly famous for its cuisine,
you'll have an especially hard time, but as I'm always
mentioning, I find no s enhances my enjoyment of food,
so I'm optimistic for you. Besides, it sounds like
your (and most people's) troubles are more in the junk
department than &quot;cuisine.&quot;

Best of luck to you both,

Reinhard
