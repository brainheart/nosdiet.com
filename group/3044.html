Beth, I know how you feel. I had twins (they'll be four next month) 
when my oldest was 19 months. You are tired, tired, tired, tired, 
tired. (I'm just tired, tired! haha) I especially understand how 
they always seem to go in different directions. It wasn't until 
they were almost three and my oldest was four that I felt almost 
comfortable enough to take them to the park by myself! 

I have to admit that I have also been bad about keeping to the nos 
diet, but I am much more aware of the sweets that I used to eat 
everyday (a little bit doesn't hurt...yeah, right!) and the seconds 
I used to gobble up off my kids plates (there are hungry people out 
there!) and the snacks I ate throughout the day (in case I'm sooooo 
busy that I might have to skip lunch!). Hopefully, I can get the 
discipline to really stick to it and EXERCISE!!!! I thought the 
shovel glove sounded a little to easy, but reading what others have 
said about it, I might give it a shot! Being a stay-at-home mom 
with three preschoolers just doesn't give me a lot of time to go to 
the gym and 14 minutes I can do. Till next time...Maria

&gt; Wow, you guys are hard to catch up with! 
&gt; It has been such a bad past few months for us. Primarily, either 
&gt; myself or the babies has taken turns at being majorly sick. And to 

be 
&gt; honest, I have not kept up with No-S let alone the posts.
&gt; Anyway, I want to lose this weight, so I know I need to get real 
and 
&gt; do this thing now!
&gt; SO here is my plan:
&gt; 1. Follow the No-S rules
&gt; 2. Cut out all sodas
&gt; 3. Replace soda drinking by drinking more water and green tea
&gt; 4. Exercise at least 5 times per week, both aerobic and weight 
&gt; training.
&gt; 
&gt; I am signing up with the company gym today, I have come to face 
the 
&gt; fact that I simply do not have the time or energy to work out when 

I 
&gt; am at home b/c EVERYONE needs something done for them and I guess 

I 
&gt; am the only one to do things for them. This way, I can do my 
workout 
&gt; here at work, and then go home and take care of everyone else and 

&gt; then have time to unwind a bit before bed... and unwinding to me 
is 
&gt; not watching TV and eating, but doing other stuff like reading (I 

&gt; LOVE to read) or arts and crafts. That way I get a little me time 

in 
&gt; and don't resent that what little me time I get is spent 
exercising. 
&gt; (Yeah I admit I hate to exercise). In conjunction w/the joining up 

at 
&gt; the gym, I can sign up for exercise classes I have always wanted 
to 
&gt; try, like Yoga and Bellydancing (I just wish they had Nia classes, 

&gt; those would be fun).
&gt; ANyway, wanted to say hi to everyone. On the bright side of all 
this, 
&gt; the babies are now crawling, so I AM getting exercise in chasing 
them 
&gt; around the house (why do they always want to crawl in the opposite 

&gt; direction of each other?).
&gt; Beth
