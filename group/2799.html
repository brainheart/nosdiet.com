I'm in my late 50s too and remember the three sit-at-the-table meals a 
day
too, but I was in England , where food were still rationed.I rmember when
candy came off ration when I was about 7 years old. I had it so rarely
before then. the ration was something like 4 ounces per child per week.
They do say that British people have never been as healthily fed since
rationing finished. fats were something like 1 ounce butter and 2 ounces
margarine per person per week. I didn't see anyone cook with oil until 
much
later.

&gt;
&gt; Dear Gadway,
&gt; This is all so true! I am very much over 50 and therefore know of 
what
&gt; you speak. My mom always had an afternoon snack for us, but that was 
it
&gt; other than the 3 meals. We never had to count calories, fat, or
carbs......I
&gt; think there were like two fat kids in the whole town, and every one 
said
&gt; they had a gland problem.
&gt; When my Mom started to gain a little in Menopause, but I think it 
was
&gt; because she loved coffee, and home baked cookies, and we kids did not 
have
&gt; much of a sweet tooth, my Dad worked away from home a lot, being a
&gt; commercial fisherman, a very thin man as you burn every calorie with 
that
&gt; hard work. Once she started walking, like her mother did, the pounds 
came
&gt; off.
&gt; But like you say....no S is Simply like life in the 50's!
&gt; Bonnie

&gt; Hello, All! I've been a happy NoS'er since January 1, and have lost 
5
&gt; pounds.
&gt;
&gt; Yesterday and today I noticed a happy thing: I am eating the way I 
(and
&gt; virtually
&gt; everybody else I knew) ate in the 1950s.
&gt;
&gt;
