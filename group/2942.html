Hey all Nossers... you can pick your friends and you can pick your 
nossers but please don't... ah nevermind s%@ew it!

I am proud of my moment today so I wanted to share it with you... 
Yes a minor triumph, but 365 minor triumphs a year will add up big 
time.
I was really hungry for lunch before and I had to wait for my car to 
be inpected.. I decided to grab a slice of pizza from this excellent 
place right next door... Actually I thought of Dunkin Donuts first 
because it had been a while and I forgot the pizza place was there.
I figured, after waiting for over 2 hours that I should have 
*something* even if that was a muffin or croissant... but I totally 
ditched the plan once I remembered there was &quot;real&quot; food just one 

door over... so that impulse was successfully evaded! Then, hungry 
as I was, I ordered 2 slices, a deeeelicious roasted pepper and 
fresh mozzarella and basil slice, and then a smaller &quot;grandma&quot; style 

slice... I was really over hungry at the time... But guess what? 
I never ate the second slice because I actually felt very satisfied 
with that first veggie loaded one!!! I gave the second one to my son 
Richard for lunch (poor guy was screaming at me because I put hot 
red pepper on it and his lips were burning! LOL)
This is a first in *history* I kid you not people... Resisting pizza 
isn't something that comes naturally to me, but in this case my body 
said &quot;That's enough I'm fine now...&quot; so I just listened!
Yay me and Yay NoS :)!!!
Hope all you are having a great day! 
Love,
Deb
