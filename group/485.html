&gt; in the injury department... hope you'll pull through
&gt; fine, not just diet-wise, and maybe even come out with
&gt; some advice for the rest of us.

My utmost advice is to not wrestle large buck goats in the snow ;-) My 
doc
told me to give it a couple of weeks if I so insisted and if it was a whole
lot better to go get it MRI'd. She thinks it is an ACL. It's doing okay, 
I
bought a really good brace to wear while I am out doing chores and that 
has
helped a lot.

On the down side, I haven't been doing my exercise tapes, because kicking 
my
leg out doesn't seem like such a great thing at the moment :)
&gt;
&gt; I can't tell you what a kick I get out of having a
&gt; farmer in this group. Your posts have been a real
&gt; pleasure.
&gt;

LOL, well thanks :) I sure will be glad when spring hits. It is 6:30 am
and I have bottle fed the kids, milked the goats, fed the horses, gave 
the
cats their share, have the milk on the stove cooking, washed my buckets,
made dh breakfast and packed his lunch, made eggsalad for my daughter who
wants it for breakfast (odd child!) and now I am sitting here with my first
cup of coffee. We're having a heck of a snowstorm right now, figures since
we just had the barn/drive cleaned out.

This is the point I really look forward to weaning off kids, and then we
move on to calves. Don't have to cook milk for them though, they just get
it dumped in their bottles right from the milk pails. Then the pigs come
on. Guess they will be earlier this year since my dd has decided to do 
pig
4-H rather than lamb this year.

I've been pouring over the gardening catalogs trying to decide what to 
plant
this year. I will try corn yet again, though it always ends up goat food
since we just don't have a long enough growing season. Just doesn't look
like a garden without the corn though :) Last year a farmer down below 
gave
us 2 hefty sacks full of corn....took me a week to get it all canned and
froze!
