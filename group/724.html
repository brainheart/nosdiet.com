Hello Lee;

You asked:
&gt; Did you say for the first 2 months you didn't lose anything and 
then after that the 12 pounds came off?

Yes. Sort of. Maybe I lost 2 or 3 pounds, but that's about it. I 
wanted to think I lost 5, but I had to lie to myself to think that. I 
don't recommend it, but I got on the scale every morning because I'm 
compulsive that weigh. For me it wasn't a problem, though, because I 
didn't really care what the scale said. I was on nos no matter what. 
First, as I wrote somewhere recently, and Reinhard also just 
mentioned again, I knew I was eating less than pre-nos and that is 
the main point as far as weightloss, or no-weightgain. 

I knew that - maybe my body didn't. It's kind of slow. Anyweigh, I 
started the first of the year and finally about mid-March I noticed 
the scale finally caught on, too. Jeesh, I'm surrounded by idiots. 
So, now my body, scale, and I have finally all agreed that I lost at 
least 12 pounds. Just weight until they find out it is going lower . 
. . .

What if I hadn't lost that? So what? Nos has other benefits just as 
good. I'm repeating what has been said before:

1. It gives you more time to do stuff besides eat and stare at the 
open refrigerator.

2. It saves money.

3. It gives your poor stomach some time to rest, relax, and feel 
better - a 5-6 hour minifast.

4. Stay on nos forever. Then, no matter what you weigh, whatever you 
weigh is what you should weigh.

4a. Be active. See shovelglove and urbanranger and either do that or 
something in the same vein.

Nos is the best thing since spilt milk.

I'm lactose intolerant.

Except for ice cream.

A major s-day nutrient.

:-)

Good luck,
Tom
