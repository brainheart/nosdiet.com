I haven't posted much and I haven't posted in about a week or two, 
but I just wanted to check in to say that this way of living is 
really living! I weathered my first crisis-- a death in the family --
and, although I wanted to designate some days as &quot;special&quot;, I 

wasn't tempted to eat much at all. There was just no going 
overboard, even though I sort of gave myself permission to. 

This involves very little will power for me, since my purpose is not 
primarily to lose weight, but to become a thin person,with good 
habits, who doesn't feel deprived on the diet seesaw, for the rest 
of my life. I am not weighing yet -- I'll wait until I really feel 
like there has been a big difference, which I am already starting to 
see. I find that when I want to look thinner the next morning, I 
just have a lighter dinner and/or exercise more. I crave healthy 
meals because I want to feel good. This is so great!!

I wanted to get off my chest the fact that I sort of had seconds 
tonight, although I started with a tiny portion of lean meat that 
was doled out to me, so my plate wasn't at all full, and it wasn't a 
portion I would have normally chosen to put on my plate. So I had a 
couple of small brisket pieces more. Now you know I'm not perfect....

Have a great weekend, everyone.

Sheila
