&gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt; 
&gt; Keep the goals as few, short term, realistic, and
&gt; precise as possible, and stick with what it's in your
&gt; power to directly control. Remember Ben Franklin, who
&gt; only concentrated on one virtue at a time. Who are we
&gt; to be more ambitious?

...yes he was a brilliant man (even though he stood around waiting 
for lightning to strike him flying a kite!)
I used to love Poor Richards Almanac and all the funny sayings he 
came up with :) Well it takes one brilliant man to recognize 
another.

And don't trade off one of these
&gt; desiderata for another. 

Latin again...Okay I may wind up smarter from these posts after all 
or just stay the same: Non Compus Mentis, lol :)

A behavioral goal, &quot;strict days on habit,&quot; will work
&gt; better. That's completely, directly under you control,
&gt; there can be no &quot;stab in the back&quot; of metabolism or
&gt; whatever not cooperating or making subtle
&gt; rearrangements. 

....Yes it's the subtle stuff that creeps up and then wham you are 
totally off track..Friend you are so smart, you are a good 
motivational writer :) thanks!..I love the reminder and I will start 
slashing days today.

If you're strict for 6 weeks there's
&gt; no question you'll lose weight. 
...Just knowing that I have really done my best will be satisfying 
in itself. Somewhere inside of me I knew something was 
uncomfortable about writing &quot;I will lose 12 pounds&quot; because I could 

hear myself in that old dieting role, the one that would be pretty 
disappointed if I didn't get there within whatever time frame I set. 
I am not really a scale junkie anyway and will probably be gaging my 
success, besides firstly and formost &quot;slashed days&quot;, but also my 

clothing fit...The truth is, my mood can drastically alter my 
perception of myself and the world..If I'm on the depressed end of 
the spectrum things can seem a whole lot darker...Yesterday Richard 
had an accident in school. He was trying to do some fancy flip 
backwards off a climbing thing at recess and fell directly on his 
head and back..He is a big kid, around 85 lbs and tall for his age. 
I spent the whole afternoon and evening icing his back and playing 
nurse, all the time worried and looking for any concussion symptoms. 
This probably sent me into an emotional drain, being so stressful. 
Thank the Lord he is fine and we were lucky...Spinal injuries can be 
permanent and a teeny concussion can kill someone, so I guess I was 
in a bit of a quiet panic.

how best to stay motivated, and for this, &quot;days on habit&quot; is 
a
&gt; much better metric than pounds.

....Yes I will totally focus, with tunnel vision precision, on this.
Thanks for reminding me of something I knew already, but had to hear 
again :)

Don't timidly ask a scale for approval every morning. Demand
&gt; success through your behavior.

...Very empowering to think this way, and truly beneficial to the 
mind body and spirit...Timid is not my game :)

You're a convict in the prison of habit, but just 3 weeks good 
behavior will get you out.
...Thanks warden! That is really funny.
&gt; 
&gt; Hang in there Deb, we need you around to keep kicking
&gt; everybody else's ass,
&gt; &gt; Reinhard

....Okay lets start now.
Everyone turn around and bend over! LOL :)

Thank you very much for this response and support. I will heed the 
advice and get my head back on straight.
Love,
Debbie &quot;the Slasher&quot; Feder
Peace and Good Wishes to everyone :)
