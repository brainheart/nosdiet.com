Hello Saleta;

&gt;If anyone has any other suggestions on how to combat this stress 
(I'm a school teacher and am stressed most of the time

Are the kids stressing you out? I bet it is only one or very few who 
are the problems. Think of the majority who are pleasant to think 
about.

Are the parents? It's their own kids. Let it go. Think of the nice 
ones.

Is the administration? Stay away from the office. Do the minimum to 
keep them off your back. Then still stay away.

Visit with the other teachers who are possitive and fun. Stay away 
from the rest. Stay away from those who say, &quot;I guess I'm ok, for a 

Monday,&quot; &quot;Wednesday, halfway through,&quot; &quot;Thank God it's 
Friday,&quot; I 
don't mind teaching if weren't for the kids.&quot; Don't say that, don't 

acknowledge it, and stay away from those who do. 

Teaching is solitary. You are boss of your own room and on your own. 
Keep it that way.

Look at all the goofy, funny things those kids do every day. Laugh at 
it. Boy, are they ignorant, weren't we? Hey, ignorance, in 
pedological terms, is job security :-).

You couldn't get a better job IMO. You are doing something 
worthwhile, helping people. What? You'd like to be at a corporation 
desk, coordinating stocking schedules for plastic delivery to the 
shrink-wrap department to get Peeps ready for shipping? No way, 
teaching is much better.

Enjoy it. I hope that helps. Or get out.

I'm a school teacher too, and love it,
and get your hand out of that ice cream bucket! Jeesh!:-)
Tom
