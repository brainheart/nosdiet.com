&gt; Yeah for you Deb :), one step back and at least two step forwards 

for all the times you were asked if you wanted one, just one pastry!
Ive wrote before that i feel that my MIL sabotages my diet, but last 
time she was in and brought cinn. muffins she brought me a fresh 
fruit cup istead, wasnt that sweet? maybe she is on my side afer all.

on the weight front: it has taken a bit more work but i am down 
another couple of # since i last reported :) Was talking with a 
friend off post,( you know who you are), that the snacking was 
probably the easiest to tackle, since if I dont bring it with me to 
work I cant eat it, not sure how i would do at home all live long 
day, might be another story then... I will never know as i am doomed 
to work for the rest of my life it seems....

Mayo, your post just kill me girl !! great to have some young blood 
around here, you remind me of my 18yo with your remarks... thanks 
for making me smile at the least!! stick with it girl, you will be a 
muscled girl one day. When you are young its so much easier to get 
toned than when you are in your 40's and lazy..So yeah for you !

Well heres hoping Deb is not tortured on an every day basis at work 
by the pastry team! as I fear for her hips !! LOLOL
