hi i had a son with adhd we only used medications on a short term basis
as they so altered his personality .it was just not him so why make my 
son
into someone hes not . my advice on the anti depressants is short term 
use..
do not use them long term and see how he feels if he says he doesnt like 
the
feeling , discontinue them both of my daughters were put on them and both
said they could not stand how they felt ..they would rather deal with the
depression otherwise thru diet and exercise 
( depression runs in my family and i have to deal with it myself but i 
found
avoiding sugar and refined carbs and getting exercise is a big help)
i found most drs are wanting to take out the prescription pad rather than
deal with problems i have add myself and you can learn to cope with it.
maybe i would be better off medicating but mostly i just learn ways to cope 

. my son went thru a similar experience in 7th grade he was constantly 
in
trouble and failing and of course i did not believe his stories that the
teachers were being terrible to him until another adult told me the same
thing . i went in to a parent teacher team meeting where seven teachers 
gang
up on you . they had no record of his disability and refused to believe 
he
had any problems said he was doing it on purpose.. refused to accept the
testing i had done on him when he was younger ....basically they refused 
any
special treatment said he was old enough to be responsible for his own 
work
etc. would not work with me at all. told me he was drop out material etc. 
so
he ended up failing 7th but went to summer school and got an A . go figure..
once he got to HS things were better but he had a rough few years there
