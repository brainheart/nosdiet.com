Dan,
Hmmmm lumberjacks. Well all in all a very weird and morbid 
illustration but a very accurate one! I have been anorexic and 
bulimic off and on since I was tweleve and I can tell you if anyone 
knows about all this junk it's me! Hospital stay after hospital stay 
i've learned it all at one point or another! I was never what you 
could call runway super model thin but I have been at my altime low 
of 120. Now that might seem an okay weight to you but for me and my 
frame and how I got there it isn't. That's when my body shuts down 
and refuses to lose anymore. I've come close to heart attack and 
failure and could feel my liver and kidneys actually shutting down. 
Not fun! 
Back to the lumberjacks. You are right on Dan! Everytime I would 
relapse (such as the last year and a half!) and eventuall pull 
myself back out of the insanity I would gain back the weight I was 
literally dying to get rid of, I'd wig out and start the process 
over agian! Why was I gaining the weight back like gangbusters? I 
had killed off my &quot;lumberjacks&quot; and allowed the &quot;couch potatoes&quot; 
to 
take over! Losing weight quickly and the wrong way caused my body to 
go into protect mode and hold on to the potatoes for reserve 
consumption and conservation while breaking down the harty 
lumberjacks as fuel. Your body will do whatever it can to keep 
itself alive. It was designed that way. Take a hint and treat it 
right for a change!
Thank you Dan for that clear picture, morbid but clear! I won't be 
forgetting it anytime soon!
Saleta
