&gt; HI Carrie from Kansas, Welcome to our warm &amp; fuzzy group at least 

on some days :)And here I thought all Arobics Instructors were fit. 
You just blew that one out of the water for me:) So how do you start 
the Nos diet on the weekend ??:))Sound like it was an easy start.SO 
how is Monday going for you? Snacking after the kids are in bad is 
pretty common since you dont have to worry about them seeing you 
eat. I will never forget when my 13yo was about 7,, she had long 
been in bed and came out to us eating a major snack of wings, ice 
cream etc..Caught in the act !! boy was she mad. So now here she is 
dong the diet with me, my bad eating habits rubbed off on her in the 
womb apparently( a new study suggests it all starts in the womb and 
how our mothers ea) Makes sense. I went crazy eating when pg with 
her. We hope to hear from you often. keep reading and posting, it 
truly does help. Julie
&gt; 
&gt; Hi All, just wanted to take a minute to introduce myself. I 
joined 
&gt; the group this weekend. I'm a 28 y/o stay-at-hom-mom and part-
time 
&gt; aerobics instructor. I joined the group because I gained 15 lbs 
last 
&gt; year over the holidays and gained another 15 in the process of 
trying 
&gt; to lose the first 15 over the last year =/. I've been on Slim-
Fast 
&gt; since last April but finally have given up on it this weekend. I 
am 
&gt; hopeful that this diet will help, especially to adjust my bad 
eating 
&gt; habits. I'm so bad about snacking, I tend to snack from the time 
my 
&gt; kids go to bed until I go to bed. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I look forward to getting to know you all!
&gt; 
&gt; Carrie :)
