----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Teresa Slack&quot; &lt;tslack@...&gt;
My New Year's Resolution is not exactly about weight but factors in. I read 

a feature in a local paper a few weeks ago about a 96-year-old woman who 

does not take any prescription drugs. That blew me away. I thought, &quot;Is it 

possible?&quot; (etc.)

Hi Teresa -

I meant to write back sooner and share that my grandparents are in their 

late 80's and take no medications at all. Most people think they are at 

least 10 years younger than they are. Neither has any serious health 
problems. They get a bit stiff, they have hearing aids...but they do nearly 

everything they want to do. Grandma, in fact, still forgets her age and 

takes a tumble every now and then when she walks too fast or loses her 

balance. So far she hasn't broken anything but a toe, so I hope this means 

her bones are strong!

They take good vitamins (not Centrum or One-a-Day variety!) and have done so 

for about the past 30 years. They have also kept a boring refrigerator for 

longer than I've known them...originally having been turned on to nutrition 

by Adele Davis, and still following many of her principles. Because my 

grandparents' interest in nutrition was passed on to my dad and mom, our 

whole family is (unfairly!) known as health nuts, but...the results speak 

for themselves. I don't plan to be popping expensive prescription medicines 

which probably do more harm than good, when I'm old.

Grandma is overweight, Grandpa just a bit, but neither has high blood 
pressure or any other problem related to the weight. Ooops...I just 
remembered that Grandma recently started on thyroid--she's been borderline 

since she was much younger, was put on and taken off before, but now she's 

gotten on it again, mainly for low energy and coldness, I think. But that's 

not *caused* by overweight, is it? And I don't consider thyroid a drug, 

though it's available only by prescription. She still eats too much sugar 

at times, for all the same reasons most of us do...I've been thinking of 

asking if she'll join me on NoS.

Anyway, this is just something else to add to your file. I honestly don't 

think the current epidemic of prescriptions is necessary, they probably do 

as much harm as good...but although I read a lot, I haven't done all the 

research myself, I'm not a qualified professional, and I probably shouldn't 

say more! Just my opinion. However, I'm also going to paste in (since we 

can't do attachments) an article I scanned long ago for another list... I 

hope nobody minds having this long text in their Digest version! I think 

you'll find it interesting.

Just Say No to Drugs



Iatrogenesis: Any adverse mental or physical condition induced in a patient 

through the effects of treatment by a physician or surgeon. - Taber's 
Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary



According to an article published in The Journal of the American Medical 

Association (JAMA) in July 2000, at least 225,000 Americans die each year 

from iatrogenic conditions. Twelve thousand preventable deaths are 
attributed to unnecessary surgery, 27,000 to medication and other treatment 

errors in hospitals, 80,000 to infections contracted in hospitals, and an 

astounding 106,000 to non-error adverse effects of drugs (meaning these 

drugs were used as prescribed by physicians). Other than heart disease and 

cancer, nothing - not stroke, diabetes, pulmonary disease, AIDS, accidents, 

murder, or illegal drugs - kills more people than the medical industry. And 

the worst culprit is FDA-approved drugs.



Americans give millions of public and private dollars to organizations that 

seek cures for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other killers. A 
significant portion of our taxes fund highway patrol officers, firefighters, 

safety inspectors and others devoted to curtailing accidents. Billions of 

dollars have been spent on the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; Yet for reasons which I 

cannot fathom, one of the most significant threats to our health - the real 

drug problem in this country - is ignored altogether.



There is no public uprising to get to the bottom of these unnecessary and 

preventable drug-related fatalities. Instead of being vilified, the entities 

behind the third-leading cause of death in our country are the heroes of the 

evening news, the darlings of Wall Street, and the chums of congressmen. 

Furthermore, the FDA, the government agency entrusted with regulating this 

industry, ignores blatant conflicts of interest, turns a blind eye to 
fraudulent testing, and approves record numbers of new drugs - many of which 

are subsequently pulled from the market because they maim and kill people.



Why Do We Ignore the Obvious?



The multibillion-dollar drug companies have penetrated our society to such a 

degree that we've come to look to drugs as the answer for everything that 

ails us. Although much of the blame lies with physicians and the 
pharmaceutical companies that court them to the tune of $13,000 per doctor 

per year, patients don't get off scot-free. We want those magic bullets that 

absolve us of taking responsibility for our health.



This trend has accelerated now that the pharmaceutical industry has been 

given the FDA's blessing to advertise drugs directly to consumers. By 
glorifying their products with slick marketing campaigns, glossy magazine 

ads and prime-time commercials, they create a false impression that 
prescription drugs are panaceas with an unblemished history of success and 

safety. And we swallow every word of their advertising hype. Thanks to this 

relatively new and ominous development, patients themselves have begun 

asking their doctors for the latest drugs by name, and doctors usually 

oblige by writing a prescription.



A Witch's Brew of Drugs


The result is that we are taking more and more drugs and placing ourselves 

at greater risk of serious harm. More than three billion prescriptions were 

written in the U.S. last year. In 1998, Americans between the ages of 65 and 

75 received an average of 11 prescriptions; those over 75 received an 
average of 13.



Folks, this is the makings of a virtual witch's brew! There are no studies 

to demonstrate what occurs when several drugs are mixed, and no one - and I 

mean no one - can predict what will happen in the long run. Yet patients are 

rarely told about the potential problems of polypharmacy (the use of 
multiple drugs to treat several health problems at the same time). On the 

contrary, they're often told that the many drugs they are taking are the 

only things keeping them alive.



Take Charge of Your Health


One of my patients told me a story that dramatically illustrates this point. 

Several years earlier this woman had a number of health problems, including 

heart disease and hypertension, for which she was taking several 
prescription medications. She felt sick all the time and had absolutely no 

energy. Furthermore, she was lonely, depressed, anxious, living in a 
retirement community and separated from her family. After much deliberation 

she decided to commit suicide and came up with what she thought was a 
fail-proof plan.



The doctor who had prescribed all of her medications told her that she would 

have to take these drugs for the rest of her life, and that if she ever 

stopped them she would die. Believing this rhetorical nonsense, her suicide 

plan was to discontinue these medications. She did so and lay down each 

night expecting not to awaken.



Well, she didn't die, and after being off drugs for three weeks she felt so 

much better that she began enjoying a happy, active retirement!



I am not suggesting that you throw away all of your medications. I recognize 

that in some case drugs are absolutely essential. However, the JAMA study 

cited above clearly demonstrates that we have a very serious problem with 

prescription drugs.



Recommendations



- Take charge of your drug regimen. Work with your doctors, but do not hand 

the reins of your health over to them. Ask questions. Do your own research. 

Those 100,000+ people who die each year - and the millions of others who are 

made ill - listened to their doctors and took their drugs exactly as 
instructed. Never forget that you own your health, and you control what goes 

in your body.



- Understand your drug regimen. Make a list of each and every drug you are 

taking, including over-the-counter medications. Go over each drug with your 

physician (if you see more than one physician, let each one know every drug 

you are on). Make sure that you understand why you are taking each drug, how 

long you will be taking it, how it interacts with other drugs and foods, and 

what adverse effects are associated with it. Ask about safer alternatives 

and find out if you could get by on a lesser dose - or discontinue it 
altogether. If you're over 65, remind your physician that seniors metabolize 

drugs differently. For many drugs, the initial dose for older people should 

be only one-half to one-fourth the usual recommended dose. If a physician 

wants to add a new drug, go through the same drill.



- Substitute lifestyle changes and nutritional supplements. In the vast 

majority of cases, drugs can be reduced or eliminated - provided you're 

willing to make some changes in your life. By watching your diet, 
exercising, and following a nutritional supplement regimen, you can avoid 

becoming a prescription drug statistic. Visit www.drwhitaker.com for 
information on natural alternatives to prescription drugs.



- Find a physician-partner. If your doctor is not willing to work with you 

on this, I suggest you look for a new doctor. For a referral to a physician 

in your area knowledgeable in non-drug therapies, contact ACAM at (800) 

532-3688, www.acam.org.
