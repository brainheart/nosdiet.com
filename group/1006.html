Please, don't worry about it. With a name like
&quot;Reinhard&quot; you can't be too sensitive about these
things. If it starts with an &quot;R&quot; and ends with a
consonant, I respond to it.

And don't apologize for &quot;rambling&quot;, either. I'm so
happy to hear no-S is working for you. Newbies
especially should take note. I noticed that you set
realistic goals -- I'm sure this helped.

&quot;Hunger and fullness&quot; approaches sound great and I'm
sure everyone wishes they worked, but they shoot
themselves in the foot by pretending the problem
they're intended to solve (excessive appetite) doesn't
really exist.

As I mention on the site:

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#abstraction">http://www.nosdiet.com/#abstraction</a>

&quot;Most commercial diets are too complicated for people
with outside interests to follow ('eating = math').
Most conventional wisdom rules about diet are too
simplistic and vague to be useful ('only eat when
you're hungry'). The nosdiet finds the happy medium
between the two. It's simple *and* specific. As a
computer programmer, I'm always looking for the right
level off abstraction for the problem at hand -- the
simplest way of conceptualizing a problem that will
actually solve it. For diet, I think this is it.&quot;

Good luck with your DH!

Reinhard

&gt; Hi everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to post here, but I've read many of the
&gt; archived posts and 
&gt; the website and have to finally chime in with my 2
&gt; cents..:)
&gt; 
&gt; This is the sanest, most doable, real world &quot;diet&quot; I
&gt; have ever come 
&gt; across. It gives just the right amount of
&gt; guidelines without going 
&gt; overboard. The &quot;S&quot; days are always just around the
&gt; corner. You can 
&gt; actually eat with everybody else, even when going
&gt; out to eat. Thank 
&gt; you, Richard, for not only putting the plan into
&gt; words, but making it 
&gt; free to all. I recommend your website any time the
&gt; question of diet 
&gt; comes up in various forums that I frequent.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as how this has worked for me, I recently
&gt; completed a rotation 
&gt; using the Slim in 6 program that I'm sure many of
&gt; you have seen 
&gt; advertised on TV. Let me tell you, the exercises
&gt; are hard and they 
&gt; work! However, the diet that is included with the
&gt; kit is pretty 
&gt; restrictive. You are supposed to start out with a
&gt; 3-day fast, then 
&gt; stick to the old &quot;6-minimeal-a-day&quot; plan, eating
&gt; only small amounts 
&gt; (and of course counting calories on top of it!!!). 
&gt; Ugghh.
&gt; 
&gt; About then, I did a Google search on diet (not sure
&gt; of the exact 
&gt; terms) and found the NoSDiet website. I have tried
&gt; &quot;hunger and 
&gt; fullness&quot; approaches to eating before, but as
&gt; Richard mentioned, they 
&gt; left out some restrictions that are needed--I could
&gt; eat from hunger 
&gt; and fullness all day!!
&gt; 
&gt; So I started the NoSDiet, combining it with the Slim
&gt; in 6 exercise 
&gt; plan. They worked great together!! I lost 7 pounds
&gt; in 6 weeks 
&gt; (which was my goal), and didn't have to give up
&gt; eating the foods I 
&gt; loved. I recently had an extended &quot;S&quot; time
&gt; (vacation and camping), 
&gt; but am now happily back to the NoS plan.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry this rambled, but I wanted to let everyone
&gt; know my positive 
&gt; experiences with NoS. Hopefully, this will give
&gt; some encouragement 
&gt; to those who wonder if it really works. It worked
&gt; (and still works) 
&gt; for me, and is definitely a plan for life. I'm even
&gt; trying to 
&gt; convince my DH to give it a shot! :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the website and this group, Richard. I'm
&gt; happy to be 
&gt; aboard. :)
