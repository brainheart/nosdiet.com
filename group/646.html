A double welcome, to shovelglove too!

I'm a little skeptical about food journals, they tend
to be fascinating for about a week and then a grueling
chore, but if it helps get you fired up, go for it.
Hopefully you won't have all that much to write
about... :-)

I'm not sure if you saw my 21-14-7 post to the
shovelglove group about what I do on my &quot;down&quot; days
and what I think might be best for beginners. If not,
take a look:

<a href="http://shovelglove.com/group/40">http://shovelglove.com/group/40</a>

With both systems, habit formation is the critical
thing. Carve out the time, the structures, and the
rest will follow. If you stood and stared at the wall
for 14 minutes every morning it would be a start.

You're right to think about taking more time for your
3 meals. It may seem like a waste (or at least
expense) of time up front, but I find that (besides
the whole weight loss bit) it ultimately saves me
time. Snacking is like procrastination. Focused blocks
of attention give you more leisure (or time to attend
to other matters), not less. Your time is better spent
*and* more economically spent. Sorry I can't speak to
the working mom issue.

You sound like you've got the right long-term
attitude. Good luck, and keep us posted.

&gt; I found this through your shovelglove website. I
&gt; did
&gt; a search for &quot;how to use a sledgehammer&quot; and your
&gt; site
&gt; was staring at me. I recently became acquainted with
&gt; my sledgehammer because we had to break up the stone
&gt; path out back. It was quite fun but lots of hard
&gt; work.
&gt; Especially for me. The sledge is moving to my
&gt; bedroom
&gt; Sunday night. I do love the way it feels so that is
&gt; a
&gt; good starter for me. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am also starting NoS tomorrow. The soda is going
&gt; to
&gt; be the worst for me. I've tried to break the habit,
&gt; but I don't like coffee or tea.. so far I've not
&gt; found
&gt; a replacement for my habit. I started a new job and
&gt; I'm the fattest person there. I really feel like I
&gt; stand out. This is the most I've ever weighed. I'm
&gt; starting with baby steps. If I can lose a lb a week
&gt; I'll be happy. It's weight coming off, not going on
&gt; that counts. I like the idea of a food diary. I have
&gt; a
&gt; small notebook so I can write down everything that
&gt; goes in my mouth. Snacks are my downfall also. But
&gt; that will be easier to stop than soda. I have my
&gt; water
&gt; bottle ready for work tomorrow. 
&gt; 
&gt; Any tips for working moms? I'm working on organizing
&gt; my day/time better so that I'll have more time for
&gt; sit
&gt; down meals (three a day) instead of grabbing
&gt; something
&gt; and going.. which leads to bad bad snacking while
&gt; out.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for reading this far!
&gt; Danielle
