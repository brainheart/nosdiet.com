Hi Maggie,

Having lost a bunch of weight and having the habit of
daily exercise firmly in place puts you in a strong
position (congratulations by the way, that's quite an
achievement, rival system or no). It's lucky you're
catching yourself before the yoyo here, because
gaining back rapidly lost weight can be disastrous in
terms of morale as well as physically. Step one is to
prevent this from happening. The focus should be on
digging in your heals and not backsliding. Worry less
about the 44 pounds you still need to lose than the 29
you've already lost and need to keep off. This isn't a
matter of you hit the goal and then you've won, game
over. It's about lifetime habits. The game goes on
even after you've hit the goal. Sustainability needs
to come first.

What does this mean, practically speaking? It means
focus on building the basic habits before jumping to
advanced stuff. I tell this to everyone, but I think
it's particularly important for someone who's just
made rapid losses and come to expect a certain rate of
weight loss to keep in mind. Give yourself generous
firsts of foods you really like so you won't be
tempted to cheat. If you can do this strictly for
three weeks, then you can revisit portion
size/composition if necessary, though you may find, as
I did, that it just takes care of itself. 

Best of luck, and keep us posted,

Reinhard
