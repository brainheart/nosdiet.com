&gt; ello I wanted to share a sort of testomony with you guys. I used to 

&gt; be over wieght by around 50 pounds. I had tried a vast array of 
&gt; different products and weight loss programs, but none of them 
worked 
&gt; for m. And if the did work I gained the weight back quickly and 
&gt; always put more weight back on. I had tried everthing from changing 

&gt; my diet, to powders, and dietary suppletments.
&gt; 
&gt; One day I was surfing the net in hopes of finding some magic drug 

to 
&gt; help me lose weight and I found this site. At first of course I was 

&gt; skeptical because of my past expeirences, but when I found out they 

&gt; had a money back garrentee I thought I give it a try.
&gt; 
&gt; I was introduced to my personal coach through the internet and he 

&gt; helped me over the phone with any questions that I had about the 
&gt; products. WITHIN TEN DAYS I LOST WIEGHT!
&gt; I've been on these products for two months and I've lost thrity-two 

&gt; pounds.
&gt; 
&gt; I feel and look great, if you want to learn more about these 
&gt; products, and the company you can check it out on the website, or 

&gt; fill in their survey. Company personal will contact you when you do 

&gt; this they will answer all you questions.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are in a similar position as I was then don't hesitate! The 

&gt; products will change your life forever. 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Best of luck,
&gt; 
&gt; Your feeling good friend!

Judging by the spelling, the weight must have been lost from his 
brain!
