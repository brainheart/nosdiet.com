Hi Leann,

This diet has two big advantages, even if somehow the
mechanics don't wind up working for you:

1) As Tom pointed out, it doesn't cost anything.

2) Even more importantly, it emphasizes mindsets that
are critical for any long term weight loss/self
discipline effort. It makes explicit the willpower and
habit issues that other diets try to hush over because
they're hard and don't sell books/candy bars.

That being said, the mechanics have worked rather well
for me. As you probably saw on the site, I'm down to
170 from 210. It's been a little over 2 years, no
yoyoing.

The group archives are browsable and searchable. Be
sure to poke around a bit before you commit.

Reinhard

&gt; Hi everyone - i stumbled across this website on an
&gt; aim page of the 
&gt; day site... it looks like a good idea but i have
&gt; learned to be 
&gt; skeptical. Can you all tell me what your experiences
&gt; are with 
&gt; this &quot;plan&quot;. I have been on almost every diet you
&gt; can think of - 
&gt; Atkins, south beach, La weight loss, etc. ...i've
&gt; wasted alot of 
&gt; money and i want to find something that actually
&gt; works. It kind of 
&gt; all started when i went on the atkins Diet, then i
&gt; was 135 and was 
&gt; really depressed because i couldn't fit my sixes
&gt; anymore ...Ha! i 
&gt; wish i had the same problem now ... I lost the ten
&gt; pounds on atkins 
&gt; and was back down to 125, but i was one of those
&gt; diet book readers 
&gt; who goes straight to the what-to-do part of the book
&gt; and doesn't 
&gt; read between the lines and never reads the entire
&gt; book (i have since 
&gt; learned my lesson). I went straight back to cereal
&gt; for breakfast-
&gt; sandwhich for lunch eating and gained about 15
&gt; pounds very 
&gt; fast...yikes! I wont go into detail about all the
&gt; diets in between 
&gt; then and now but i will tell you that i am 155 (no
&gt; one ever guesses 
&gt; that so some of it must be muscle) and 5'6&quot; size 8
&gt; or 9 ..i do also 
&gt; work out everyday....but i really feel more
&gt; comfortable at say -
&gt; compromising- a size 7... I could really use some
&gt; advice. Thanks - 
&gt; Leean
&gt;
