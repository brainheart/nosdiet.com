Hi Lisa,

&gt; Well, I wanted to say HI and introduce myself as
&gt; well.

Welcome!

&gt;I do find I have the hungry
&gt; feeling between meals, but to
&gt; me that is a reminder that this is going to work for
&gt; my ultimate goal.

Of course you'll be hungry in the beginning. Your body
is used to an incessant flow of snacks, it's going to
need some retraining. To make this less unpleasant,
keep the portions big to begin with. Yes, it can be a
lot of calories, but it'll make it much easier to get
the habit discrete meals down, which is key.

&gt; Exercise is also hard for me, in finding the time.
&gt; I do go to the YMCA, but
&gt; my 1 daughter is going threw a separation anxiety
&gt; phase, so I hate to put
&gt; her in the nursery when she cries so much. At least
&gt; the weather is starting
&gt; to come around and I can at least go outside and
&gt; play with my kids if
&gt; nothing else.

My exercise routine, shovelglove, may not be for
everyone (though do check it out, if you haven't, link
below), but there's a component of it that can be
profitably adopted for very different routines:
&quot;schedualistically insignificant time.&quot; This means
intense but brief (14 minute) workouts every N-day.
Doesn't sound like enough? Try alternating pushups,
situps, crunches, squats, jumping jacks for 14 minutes
without pauses or breaks. I think you'll be amazed at
how thoroughly you can exhaust yourself in a very
short span of time, without leaving your home and
without any equipment whatsoever. And trust me, you'll
feel it the next day. I did this in Florida when I was
on vacation and didn't have access to a sledgehammer.
Is this an ideal workout? Maybe not. I for one hate
squirming around on the floor. But it's totally excuse
proof. Maybe just save it for the days you can't make
it out to the gym, or whatever your preferred but more
time/motivation consuming routine is. There should be
no designated exercise days when you skip out on your
routine because it's raining, you're too busy, etc. At
the very least, you can do this.

See:

<a href="http://www.shovelglove.com">http://www.shovelglove.com</a>

For more.

&gt; 
&gt; I do have a few ?'s but I&quot;ll hold off for a few more
&gt; days before I ask.

Looking forward to those questions,

Reinhard
