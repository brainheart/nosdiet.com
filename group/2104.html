they always rope her into buying their bars, shakes, snacks, etc.

....Corporate scoundrels! It's a mockery of a travesty of two 
mockeries of sham!!!

Lots of food combining and hardly any foods are really &quot;legal&quot; 

except for a small list and of course, this company's products. It's 
a total scam. 
.....Like I said yesterday, for people who feel desperate, and are 
looking for an easy answer, some of these scam/plans can be very 
seductive...a desperate person doesn't necessarily weigh the options 
rationally, and is a potential &quot;sucker&quot; for these phony baloney 

bozo &quot;centers&quot;... They take away all control, and sidestep the issue 

of taking personal responsibility (except in the pocketbook of 
course) for making good choices...Brainwashing... I'm not surprised 
that they give your poor ol' mil a reprimand, they are just trying 
to keep her &quot;meek&quot; and they are hoping that their scare tactics will 

keep her choking up the cash...God forbid she should come out of her 
brainwashed state...they will beat every idea of self sufficiency 
out of her if she believes them.
I think you should take one of her &quot;diet bars&quot; and put a taped on 

piece of paper over the name and write &quot;deception bar&quot; in big red 

letters(credit to Engels :)

&gt; I am officially done with &quot;dieting&quot; of this kind, though. I am 

going to stick with No S. It's a total no-brainer! :)

....Yes and for those of us, who somewhere later in life, realized 
that every day a new neuron dies up there, a &quot;no-brainer&quot; has 

limitless appeal and a charm all of it's own :)
So why accelerate the death of those precious brain cells by using 
them to keep a running account of calories all day (or even *bites 
taken*, that one still has me laughing!)

Citizens of the World! Save your brains!
NoS rules! diet &quot;centers&quot; drool!
Okay very juvenile, but it's true :)
Love,
Deb
