yes you are right that sugary foods etc will put you to sleep i think its a blood 
sugar thing also so not eating at night was a fear i had also 
took me about a month to get over it. and like i said in my previous post i did let 
myself have one small snack before bedtime i am down to a cup of herbal tea and one 
ounce of cheese. its prob like quitting smoking its just a habit.. but i was so 
afraid hunger would keep me awake but so far i am doing fine as long as i eat a 
substantial dinner and not leaning on food as my entertainment for the evening

&gt; Dear Deb,
&gt; Got one last photo to send you. Your mailbox is full. I was not 
anerexic,
&gt; and was just kidding....I used to follow a no S style, without 
even knowing
&gt; back then. Sean has a girlfriend, and I am sure she would flip if 

I gave you
&gt; his E-mail address. 

Bonn, I don't recall asking for his email, only curious to hear his 
music...Puleeese I ain't no homewrecker LOL :)
I am glad you weren't anorexic and it was just a little self-jibe.
Actually my neighbor in high school or college was anorexic...Very 
scary disorder...she is ok now, I think, but back then she looked 
like she was a walking skeleton...No exaggerations,,,just bones.
Years later she spoke briefly about how it all began. Some kind of 
bet with her brother that &quot;got out of hand&quot; 
There had to be more to it than that,,,maybe that was just the event 
that triggered it.

On a lighter note I have urban rangered 2x this week so far, and 
only had one late night excursion to the kitchen (1 am like last 
time)
this for me is really, a part of having problems at times with 
insomnia...I know it sounds strange,but I think that when my body 
and mind cant just turn off and sleep (which for anyone who tends to 
have mild insomnia can verify is very very annoying) I feel like I 
can't shut off until some kind of food, which usually is high 
calorie, like cereal or cold cuts or anything which changes my brain 
chemistry to create more serontonin, is in me. I have no clinical 
proof of this, however I really notice that it is a physical feeling 
not just &quot;hey I am bored or lonely&quot;. But in general I have been 

very triumphant in my new ways...That habit is a really old one and 
I will now make it a priority to focus my energy solving.
Right after I eat something I can sleep, but clearly I and all you 
know this is a NO S no no and real bad for overall health...
Anyone else have insomnia or similar issues with late night food 
stuff? It's not my schedule...I am just wired like this and want to 
change the circuits. It doesn't happen daily anymore, so I guess 
that is a positive move towards change and I will focus on my 
success :)
Onward fellow soldiers!
Love,
Debbie
