It's one of those very unfair things in life that men lose weight easier
than women. I am dieting and my husband isn't . He has lost about 15 pounds
in the last few months. He needs to, so it's not a problem. We're both
diabetic, so we're keeping blood sugars well under control.

&gt; Dear Debbie,
&gt; My son is in his 30's and is a music teacher and in several bands,
&gt; mostly guitar, and won't marry as it is too hard on a family , so I 
can
&gt; imagine it was hard for you...it is that way being with any artist, 
that
is
&gt; only into their art. I for one am a painter, but that comes second to 
my
&gt; marriage of 41 years to the same man. His only art is old car restoration.
&gt; Anyway one can overdo on French Cuisine, but I never did all the years 
in
&gt; Europe. I thought it was the active life syle, but perhaps it was 
the
&gt; similiar to no S diet at the time!
&gt; My husband and neighbor and I walk 40 mins every morning...I see a
&gt; difference in both of them-much slimmer, but it does help keep my 
blood
&gt; pressure down, but does not do much for me in the weight department.
&gt; Bonnie
