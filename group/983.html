If you find you have problems with carbohydrate foods, have you been 
investigated for diabetes? Overweight is a risk factor.I have been diagnosed

diabetic for almost a year and even with my pills I still do better with a 

lowish carb intake. Bread in particular sends my blood sugars sky high. 
this

is a pity, because I love bread, particularly Marmite sandwiches,I manage 
my

diet by No-S, low calories and low saturated fats. I have lost 9 kg. by my 

doctor's scales and clothes are getting a lot looser. To get the BMI right 

I need to lose about 20 kg. more. My doctor has reduced my medication 
already. ( to convert Kg to pounds for non Europeans double the pound number

and add 10% of that figure. 1 kg. is about 2.2 pounds.)

&gt; Hi Alison 
&gt; Thanks for the idea. One question though. Can we follow Jay Robb 
&gt; diet book without having to buy his products? 
&gt; Thank you
