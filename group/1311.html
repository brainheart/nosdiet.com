Hi Rich

I really enjoy your posts.

Your teeth experience sounds seriously scary. Three 'esses' I'm sure you
could have done without. I hope it has settled down now.

I still enjoy the food just as much
without that extra bit: I still spend just as long eating it, and
I still feel full at the end (where before I'd probably have felt
overfull), and it still tastes the same.


That's great. I think it has lots of benefits - as you will see from my 
post
to Deb, esp re the digestion.

The other thing I thought of too is about the time it takes the stomach 
to
get the message to the brain re fullness. Eating slower will give a chance
for that to happen.

What you say also makes me think about why I need to eat: part is flavour,
part is needing to be full (which is why I eat quickly sometimes) - to 
fill
that empty feeling that has nothing to do with hunger, part is habit.

One of the things I have enjoyed this last week (when I was No Sing - and 
it
hasn't all been successful) was feeling hungry - real hunger, and going 
with
it until it was time to eat, or I had time to eat.

All the very best

Jen
