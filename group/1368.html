&gt; For the evening, call it another meal and have loads of finger 
sized pieces
&gt; of raw veggies

Hey Hana, GREAT suggestion! I too have had problems in the 
evening. I will venture a guess that this is a very common thing 
for us all. I think it is a great idea because it is a PLANNED 
meal...Clearly it would still benefit us to have less after a 
certain hour, but to paraphrase Mr.Reinhard from his magnus opus, I 
don't think anyone ever got fat from eating beets.
And your plan to have nutritious stuff is really great!
Watchout though..Try not to make that meal very late. Unless you are 
coming home from work at some ungodly hour, and even then, do make 
an attempt to go to sleep with as little food in your stomach as 
possible. We all have been told not to go to sleep with food in our 
bellies. 
Heres why: I was taught to understand that if you eat something 
like fruit or really anything, but especially anything that will 
affect your blood sugar, in the late in the evening, that will raise 
your insulin level and, insulin directly inhibits the production of 
growth hormone, which is usually released into our blood while you 
sleep. ..During childhood and adolescence this hormone is what makes 
us get bigger, and taller (I could swear that when my son was an 
infant I would notice that he looked bigger, even after just waking 
up from a nap, or the next morning, just changing infront of my 
eyes!)And even though we are all grown up now, (at least physically)
we still need it. As an adult, growth hormone is key to our immune 
system functioning properly, and now takes on the task of &quot;Repair 

and Restore&quot; of all the cells in our bodies. And guess what, 
no'ssers the more growth hormone we release, or was it growth 
hormone factor, well one of them, cause they go together,,,,the more 
fat the body burns. A plus for sure! It also makes the task of detox 
much easier for the Liver, which like the release of growth hormone, 
should be happening between say 11:00 and 3am. Unless we are 
watching Dave Atells &quot;Insomniac&quot; lol...

I have noticed this week, that since I am on a emailing spree, big 
time!, I am not sitting and watching as much mindless tv and for 
some reason. Probably the fact that I am doing something that is fun 
and interesting for me, and using my hands. A great way to stave off 
snacks, since you are simply to busy to be bothered with stuffing 
your face with pretzels...versus tv where you are sitting, or in 
most cases &quot;sprawling&quot; in front of that thing, seeing countless 

commercials for Dr. Angus! and Popeyes Giant mega chicken buckets. 
Actually they are really kindof grossing me out these days...
Besides typing emails, anything you can do with your hands like, 
playing an instrument, sewing, is great..Or, if the urge hits you of 
course
Shovelglovving...I am going to buy mine today, then when it is 
really snowing around here I will be ready :)!
You can't eat, unless it's through an iv, if you are using those 
hands for something else!
I didn't weigh myself today, but I know I look alot less 
&quot;big boned&quot; this week..Something is going right :)

PS..Hana, you are clearly up on nutrition and suppliments. Very 
cool! I have read that in addition to B complex suppliments, 
betacarotene can be found naturally in all Orange fruits and 
veggies, like yams, cantelope, carrots, taking in some extra 
Magnesium and Calcium should help during PMS. This may explain why 
for no apparent reason we sometimes will crave chocolate at that time
Chocolate, I've heard, has the most magnesium of any food on the 
planet. The ancient Aztec food of the gods :)
And to quote a great sermon I heard from the Reverend Bruce of the 
Community Church in NY,
Chocolate is &quot;Legal, Unscheduled and Over the Counter&quot;
But of course must be savored on only S days!
And my 8 year old son Richard is No ssing too, which I am very proud 
of and glad about..He will have those habits down before he even has 
a chance to get overweight. And of course it's great to have his 
help.

Ok I am really going to Sears now to get my future home torture 
machine :)
Peace and Blessings,
Debbie &quot;Deb-Star&quot; Feder LMT and
Amatuer Clinical Nutrition Enthusiast :)
