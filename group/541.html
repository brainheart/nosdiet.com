Hi Everyone. I am doing really good today and strange things are 
happening. I was one of those skinny people until about 40. I could 
eat everything and stay thin. Then I guess my system slowed down or 
I did and each year the weight started creeping. I still ate like a 
skinny person. Now I am at 160 lbs. Too much for me and I am 50 
years old. 

I usually have to eat all day long, every hour and since at work we 
serve food I have access to it also. It seemed if I didn't eat 
constantly I was craving terribly. Well, last night at dinner I 
couldn't finish my full plate ( I did eat most of it ). That was 
strange for me. Then this morning I didn't wake up starving. 
Usually I can't wait until I make my breakfast to go and the minute I 
start to drive I down it. Well I just felt like waiting until I got 
to work. So I just drank my water. For me that was really strange. 
I didn't get hungry before lunch and again couldn't finish it. 
Really really strange. And I am in no rush for dinner. Do you think 
the no sugar is doing this? I know there must be sugar in some 
things I eat but I am not eating what I know has sugar for sure or 
drinking sodas.

By the scale I haven't lost any weight yet but I just started last 
Thursday. Oh, yesterday my husband asked me if I have been eating 
less because my &quot;backside&quot; looked a little smaller!!! I said no, 

just doing a little exercise. ( I am a closet NOSDIETer ) I did 
start on a moderate exercise program about 1 month ago.

The post are really helpful and I look forward to reading them each 
day.
