hi val and deb

this is a very interesting thread.

perfectionism is deadly and lead to another 'p' word procrastination, which
all to often leads to paralysis. I can say this with great authority having
observed it in myself time and again. I see myself as a reformed
perfectionist who has outbreaks now and then. perfectionism goes away as 
you
come to love and accept yourself as you are. I've noticed that too. we 
need
to be chosing different ways of eating, such as no-s, because we love and
care for ourselves, not because we are punishing ourselves. that is one 
of
the reasons no-s is so special and powerful. it encompasses and loving 
and
understanding approach to health.

a wise person once reworked the aphorism: 'if it is worth doing, it is 
worth
doing well'. that is perfectionism at its pernicious best.

the reworking was 'if it is worth doing, it is worth doing badly'. it took
me a long time to get my head around that. bottom line - if it is worth
doing, it is worth doing, no matter how you do it.

and it segues nicely into the commitment side of things, and giving 100% 
to
what you are doing. while it superficially may seem the same, it is the
antithesis of perfection.

you can give 100% and still not do something all that well. but that isn't
the point - it is as deb's choir leader said -- give it 100% and you have
nothing to regret.

love
jen
