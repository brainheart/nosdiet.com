Good morning! My name is John, and I am a pastor and school teacher.
I
think that the no-s diet is the only viable answer to maintaining proper
body weight. A couple of years ago, I went on WeightWatchers, and lost
about 15 pounds. At 6 feet tall and 200 pounds I am not so very far from
my &quot;target weight&quot;. As any dieter can tell you, those last pounds 
come
off hard! Unfortunately, after all my hard work, I almost immediately
gained the 15 pounds back. :-( On WeightWatchers, I felt like I was
starving to death all the time, and was too weak to do very much work.
I
really began to wonder what the point of being thin and living longer
was, if I was unable to accomplish any meaningful work in my life.

Over the past few months, my snacking has really gotten out of control.=20
I was eating a candy bar or M&amp;M's every day, and my weight has ballooned
up to 212 pounds (fully dressed and with my work boots on). This weight
gain has got to stop!

I have been on the No-S plan since the beginning of the month, and it
has
not been too hard so far. I am kind of a determined person, and it
seems
like I may eventually get my body in the habit of eating less. I think
I
may stick strictly to the plan, and then weigh myself at the end of the
month.

At any rate, I hope you all have a wonderful week, and I am looking
forward to working with you all.

John
