You don't actually sound as if you are as much as 25 pounds overweight. 
Have
you checked your BMI? Perhaps what you need is reshaping exercise.Still 
a
healthy eating pattern like No-s won't do you any harm anyway

&gt; &gt; I am feeling particulary desperate to lose some
&gt; &gt; weight right now
&gt; &gt; because I'm getting married in Hawaii in June and
&gt; &gt; want to look good
&gt; &gt; in my wedding dress. I'm a size 12 and weigh about
&gt; &gt; 170. I'm tall
&gt; &gt; and would like to take off about 25-30 pounds.
&gt;
&gt; I got an email last week from a woman who lost 55
&gt; pounds on no-s in 2004. It can be done. But
&gt; psychologically you'll want to keep the focus longer
&gt; term. By longer term I mean life. Not only is this the
&gt; more important term, but staying focused on it will in
&gt; all probability also get you better 6 month results.
&gt; Desperation can be a great motivator, but it's also
&gt; dangerous. It's a great kick in the pants to get you
&gt; started, but it spikes fast, you've got to smooth that
&gt; desperate energy into longer term attention. How do
&gt; you do this? Measure your initial progress in terms of
&gt; days on habit rather than pounds. There is no question
&gt; that if you can manage the days, the days will take
&gt; care of the pounds. But since the days are *directly*
&gt; under your control, the only way you can fail is by
&gt; choice. Choice is hard, but it's what it comes down to
&gt; in any case, and so you might as well start by
&gt; admitting this fact. You can step on the same scale in
&gt; a single day 3 different times and get three different
&gt; numbers. That can throw you. You can eat well and not
&gt; see it register immediately, or go up a pound despite
&gt; your efforts. That can throw you even more.
&gt; Behaviorally you've succeeded, but metrically, you've
&gt; failed. That can't happen if the behavior *is* the
&gt; metric. You can't snack and not snack. You can't have
&gt; seconds and not have seconds. You can't have a
&gt; snickers bar and not. You do or you don't. There are
&gt; no surprises. There is no one to throw you but
&gt; yourself (and yourself is plenty, believe me).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; know deep down that
&gt; &gt; dieting is not the answer and I really feel like
&gt; &gt; this program can
&gt; &gt; give me the tools to re-train my willpower which has
&gt; &gt; been nonexistent
&gt; &gt; in the last several years.
&gt;
&gt; A little willpower builds a little habit which builds
&gt; a little more willpower, etc. People go to the gym
&gt; *because* they're weak, not because they're strong.
&gt; They go to get strong. Weakness isn't an excuse not
&gt; to, it's the reason why. Same thing here.
&gt;
&gt; To push gym analogy a little further: no one starts
&gt; out benching 200 pounds. You start with just the bar,
&gt; maybe, and gradually work your way up. If your
&gt; willpower just gets you through a few days (or one
&gt; day, or one meal) on nos to start and then you fail,
&gt; don't despair. Try to go one day more for the next
&gt; stretch, then one day more, etc. Unlike the gym, you
&gt; won't have to do this forever. There will come a point
&gt; when habit, like an invisible spotter, will carry most
&gt; of the burden for you. It'll sit there in the gym
&gt; doing a million reps while you are free to move about
&gt; and worry about other stuff.

&gt; &gt; This is surely the wackiest website i have
&gt; &gt; encountered.Also it's so
&gt; &gt; simple that it should work.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure if no-s would make anyone's absolute
&gt; &quot;wackiest&quot; list (there is some strange stuff out
&gt; there), but I hope it's a contender for &quot;wackiest that
&gt; is also generally useful.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; So i am in as of now , i have had all my
&gt; &gt; stray questions or quests for info met by the
&gt; &gt; website and i am
&gt; &gt; looking forward to feeling good.
&gt; &gt; Regards.
&gt;
&gt; Let us know if anything else occurs to you. And keep
&gt; us posted as to your progress.
&gt;
&gt; Best to you both,
&gt;
