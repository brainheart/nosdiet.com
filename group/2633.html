Hey Deb!
Just thought I would let you know that accupuncture works wonders. 
I was in a car accident just over a year ago and compacted some disks 
in my back...ouch! The only thing that worked/works to relieve the 
pain is accupuncture! It is also unbelievably relaxing and calming. 
Also I want to say good job on searching out alternative methods of 
healing your body and mind...lots of people immediately turn 
to &quot;popping pills&quot;(not that I have a problem with it...it's just not 

for me!) without looking into different ways of treating what ails 
them! So good for you! I also want to say a big thanks to you because 
you are so supportive and positive when you post on this site! It's a 
real inspiration! So I hope you have a great week! And good luck with 
the accupuncture!

&gt; Hi Friends, you may check my progress on the yahoo shovelglove 
group 
&gt; in the &quot;files&quot; section.
&gt; I think it's time to get a new mouse for my paint program, that's 

&gt; supposed to look like a calendar :)
&gt; Today was great, although dinner was an overloaded plate for sure, 

&gt; and there was no need for seconds...
&gt; I tried to eat an orange for dessert and couldn't finish it since 

&gt; dinner was a lot. Well I'm grabbing a seltzer and it's off to 
&gt; sleep :) I am going to get accupuncture on Saturday and hope it 
&gt; helps me with my various health issues and state of mind/body...
&gt; I am feeling great, hope you all are too! :)
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb
