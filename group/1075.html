I know alot of people have been giving you advice. Probably because 
it strikes a cord with all of us. For me because I was in your shoes.
Good for you for being strong enough to confront those catty girls
Karma or whatever you want to call it will catch up with them. You
just keep being you. Whenever possible do things the hard way often
it will burn more calories, and make you appreciate the results alot
more. Your best friend sounds like someone you can really spend time
with. Why not just go for long walks with him. Very good for you,
burns alot of calories and gives you two a chance to talk.(Much better
than than a phone call anyway) It's always good to have someone to
talk to who supports you. I have mentioned before my weight problem
was always a problem. It just got worse in my adult years. I had an
older sister and she was always the skinny one. It didn't help things
when she was a senior in highschool and an A Cup, and I, her little
sister shot up into a DD cup when I was your age. She and her guy
friends teased me endlessly. I was the happiest with my weight when
I went on a bus strike walking two or more miles to my highschool
every day my sophmore or Junior year. That same year I was in an
aerobics and weight training class for the whole year. I didn't snack
because I never had money to buy stuff and my parents never had snacks
in the house unless you count leftovers. You are in a very special
time in your life. Live deliberatly. Don't get sucked into the just
going with the flow that happens in your age. Anyone who talks bad
about you behind your back is a toxic personality and is to be avoided
whenever possible. If what they say is hurtful consider the source,
After all the truth can hurt just as much as lies. If the person
critisizing you is worthy of your admiration and respect (ie someone
who loves you,or you care about)take the critisizm into consideration,
however if they are not, ignore it and do as you please. I hope you
are able to enjoy Nos and reach your goals without obssesing. If you
can do it you will be happier.

Exercise thing: I usually walk whenever possible. As I told Kimi to do
I do things the hard way whenever possible. I never use a bread maker
you wouldn't believe the exercise you get kneading a big lump of
dough. I dig out my flower bed the hard way with a shovel and my own
strength.( I was sore for days after I did that)Yes it took me longer
but I am so proud of that four foot by two foot patch. If you really
think about every way your body moves, you can come up with movements
everyday that you can do just a little bit differntly to make it
harder and still avoid hurting yourself. I recently started rotating
my pilates,step aerobics, and Richard Simmons tape so I am exercising
6 days a week even if I don't go for a walk. I am probably ramping up
my routine because my 10 year class reunion is just around the
corner.I don't really want to go(I only went to that school for a
year) but, I haven't seen some of my friends in so long I really miss
them. 
Your friend in health Melanie.
P.s for anyone who is wondering I haven't been absent because I was
cheating I have just been really busy, and barely able to check my e-mail
