I've done 6 week total body makeover - lost 30 lbs in 6-8 weeks. It 
has crept back over the last 3 years tho :c(
Then I've done Atkins - lose 10 lbs in a week easily! And then easily 
gain it back because I HATE the smell of bacon and eggs in the 
morning 2 hours after I cooked it - *ugh*
Then I've done SBD and it's too much healthy meat and veggies for me! 
But that I can lose almost 10 lbs in a week on too...
And DH is doing the &quot;don't eat all day long until dinner diet&quot; lol - 

where he has lost like 20 lbs in a few weeks! And it's frustrating as 
heck. I know it kills your metabolism and I could NOT live not eating 
all day long (being partially hypoglycemic - you should see me when I 
go too long without eating!!! If I don't come close to passing out or 
get a severe headache, I am way worse than PMSing!! I am psychotic! 
You should see me waiting at a restaurant that doesn't bring bread or 
something!!! ACK!! :c) )
So anyway, my point after rambling (which I am best at) is that it is 
so difficult to lose so slowly. I am going to put my scale 
downstairs - #1 so that my husband will not come in every morning 
while I am trying to sleep and show off his even bigger pants!! And 
#2 so that I know I am doing what I can and still remain happy - and 
that I'm certainly not eating MORe - so hopefully I will lose... 
however slowly...
Hey - can we post progress - so I can see how it works for people... 
Maybe how long you have been sticking to it. If it's hard for you to 
stick to. What your struggles are. And how well you have done on 
it... And anything else that sounds like cool info :c)
I'd like to get to know you all and this &quot;diet&quot; better :c)
