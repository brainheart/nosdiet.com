Hey all good morning :)
I'm home with a little stomach flu...Not so terrible, but enough to 
make me feel crummy and queasy... So please feel bad for me LOL :)
I was sleeping most of the day yesterday and didn't really post, 
look what happens...
No posts! LOL That's funny!
Well I thought I'd post a little just to take my mind of my 
nauseousness...
I have so many psychic experiences guys (no I don't hear dead 
people!) and here's a sugar/diet related one from a day or two ago...
I was watching tv with Richard. When he gets home he usually 
watches an hour of tv before his homework, then dinner etc... 
I was mentioning to him to keep an eye on how many commercials were 
products made out of sugar... Every single commercial was for a 
sweet cereal or a sweet fruit rollup or something with sugar... 
every single one... I told him that this is part of the reason so 
many kids feel like they have to have these things regularly in 
their diets, because of all the ads targeted to elementary school 
aged kids...
Well this morning I found an article from NY Newsday (not my fave 
viewpoints normally but my mom's news paper) which she had left 
there for me to read... She knows I am actively limiting Richards 
and my sugar intake...
The headline, &quot;Kraft to curtail kid-targeted ads&quot;
Basically they will be somewhat limiting their ads for biggies like 
Kool-Aid, (for non-Americans this is pure sugar and fake dyes)
Chips Ahoy, Oreos... All this is supposed to be coinciding with new 
government nutritional guidelines. We'll see how much they really 
cut down on the ads. My guess is it won't be much, just a token 
gesture... However, in the bigger scheme of things, Kraft is to junk 
food as Exxon is to petroleum, so even if their token gesture leads 
to other little token gestures with companies like McDonalds and 
General Mills, that's their hope, according to the article (not the 
token part, that's me...)
Okay if the biggest pushers of sugar in the food industry are 
starting to do things like this, it may mean the dawn of a new less 
sugar loaded era.
I think it's time for Reinhard to send the NOS diet to the bigwigs 
at the FDA! LOL :)
Seriously folks, it was a nice thing to see that my thinking about 
the ads is actually being thought of where they are originating from.
Kids will always love sweets to some extent, but it shouldn't be the 
only option available for a treat, as all these commercials make it 
seem. I hope Krafts money is where their mouth is, and believe me, 
it's alot of money at stake...I will be watching eagerly to see what 
their new &quot;angle&quot; is...Even if they don't do anything major, I think 

it's great that a sizable enough amount of people in high places are 
rethinking the whole sugar coated kids concept..Maybe our 
grandchildren won't be at such high risk for obesity and diabetes, 
as kids are now.
Well no matter what, it's still up to us to set the trend on the 
home front :)
Peace and Love,
Deb
