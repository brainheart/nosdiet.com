I had quite an upset night yesterday and an even more upsetting

comfort myself..

NOTHING is worth upsetting urself about ...! or may be some things are- but still not 
enough to ruin ur day



So I didn't! I have been trying too hard to be good, to let a sad 
evening (and we are talking the waterworks were on big time!) make 
me fat. That's no solution is it? I won't use food to medicate my 
bad feelings anymore. 

Deb, u could always medicate ur bad feelings with 1) s-days 2)keeping ur mind 
occupied with another project (say nosdiet)



I'm still losing weight this week and my inches 
are consistently going down, especially my arms..
I'm too embarrased to say what I started out as inchwise around my 
arms and my waist,

WOOOOOOW u lose inches on this diet??? i didnt know that one more reason to 
absolutely love it

Woo hoo! They are now into the next &quot;inch&quot; notch down on my tape 

measure.. Yayyyyy :)
Peace and Love,

ps: once i get the hang of SG i am gonna jump right in

pss:i dont wake up at 4 am.. i sleep far too late for that.. it was an exception 
(slept at 1:30 am and woke up at 4:30 ) cuz i had to read a few things before i go to 
college and was far too tired to do them before i go to sleep... i have a pretty 
hectic sleeping patterns... and eating patterns.. and studying patterns.... etc etc 
etc
