&gt; HI Deb, I cant believe you tried it again :)What were you thinking 

girlfriend ? Scales are evil emotional manipulators, and only God 
knows how old that scale is since Moms rarely throw anything away !
I feel very blimpy today, not sure why, maybe just tired. I need 
some coffee very soon. We will def. eat salads for dinner tonight. 
You would be so proud of My 13yo. She has lost at least 15# now, and 
is looking great. I am taking her to have her hair done on the 8th 
by my hair designer. He is so awesome and I NEVER have had a bad 
hair day since i started going to him 2 years ago i think. Expensive 
but worth it. She has been asking for a new hair style as hers is 
long, thick and straight.and I think she deserves a treat:)a reward 
for her hard work.In fact we all need to treat ourselves better than 
we have in the past.We put our tree up last night, so pretty, all 
gold and blue ornamnets &amp; white lights. was quite weird not having 

the oldest daughter here. Didnt feel quite right somehow. Emptying 
nest syndrome ? I say emptying as she is not yet all the way moved 
out and may come back home :) She is the one who will be shocked 
over her sis appearance. Heather(18) has always been petite and not 
over 100# fully clothed.Her sis out weighed her at 5yo i think. 
There was not much of handing down of clothes in our house.Well now, 
I am just rambling along now aren't I? As far as Mangoes go, I 
started eating them in Ecuador several years ago, fresh off the 
tree. OMG they were so good, we all love them. Mouth watering at the 
thought. Wish we had a tree like Lee. The racoons would eat them 
just like the pineapples and lemons in the backyard, they feast on 
them before we can get them picked sometimes.As far as tape measures 
go, I have one nicely rolled up in my bathroom drawer and there it 
stays ! I for one dont really want to know what my hip and waist 
measurement is.:)I may never eat again or do something even more 
drastic.:O I still would lke to be losing weight faster!Like in 
the &quot;Good ole days&quot;. I guess those days are over. I heard the other 

night on the radio,that women become more comfortable with there 
body image the older they get. I am not there yet ! Sometimes wish I 
was =} But we are on a mission aren't we? Along there with you 
Debbie,love and not weighing Jools

&gt; &gt; Well it was my monthly weigh in.....
&gt; 
&gt; Hi guys, just one last one for the morning and then I'm off to SG&gt; 

definitely a harmful addiction!) use my mothers scale! LOL!

&gt; I figured it's December, start fresh, then measure with the 
&gt; tapemeasure... I wasn't expecting a loss, but also wasn't 
expecting 
&gt; much of a gain, if anything, possibly one or two pounds...The damn 

&gt; thing said I had gained like 9 lbs! LOL...
&gt; Well this time I said &quot;there's no way in hell that F&amp;78-beep'in 

&gt; thing is right!!!
