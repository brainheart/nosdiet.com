Yes my DH does snack in frount of me, but it really doesn't bother me. 
He
has lost a lot of weight recently , over the course of a year, and his
snacks are normally healthy, fruit, fruit popsicles, as I won't buy anything
else.....why spoil all his hard work of losing weight to snack on junk 
and
gain it all back. Actually , just knowing that I can do what I want on the 
S
days, and eating more at the real meals is fine. Like yesterday at art 
club,
my friend and I went out to lunch, as usual ,and she commented on me eating
a bun, instead of my usual big salad, and I told her about the S diet. 
Well
when we got to our club, as usual, everyone had snacks, and as usual trying
to get me to eat them, and me saying...no thanks ,just had lunch...we went
out and I am stuffed, ect, ect,....but it is only fruit...or cheese...or 
a
tiny doughnut....Why won't people accept No Thankyou. I used to say I 
can't eat sugar, so now some are bringing in other than sweet stuff!
My friend said , she never realized until I told her about the no S diet,
how much people bug you to eat. She said she was so proud of herself for
only eating one cracker and one piece of cheese...maybe I should explain 
No
S to the whole group...she seemd to like the idea.
