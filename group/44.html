Hi Tay,

From what I'm hearing, breakfast seems to be the toughest meal for most 
people.

Here are some things I eat for breakfast. Not all of them are *ideal* for losing 
weight, 
but I like them and they're no S. I list them just in case you're stumped.

low-sugar cold cereal. I'm not a huge fan of this stuff, but some people love it. Cut 

some strawberries or bananas in and it becomes more palatable (and healthier).

oatmeal. I like it with pecans, hazelnuts, raisins and dried apricots, but variety is 
key. 
I eat it for lunch a lot because it's so convenient for the office.

Egg scrambled, boiled or sunny side up. With or without bacon. Great with beans or 

leftover vegetables, salsa and/or ketchup. Probably not great to eat every day, but 

fine a few times a week. 

bagel and cream cheese (sometimes)

english muffin or toast and cheese (sometimes) 

croissant (a rare treat)

Some freshly baked bread/baguette/roll and butter. Simple, but if you can good 

bread, you can't beat it. Decent butter helps too. In the states, plugra is 
nice.

And finally, my favorite: open faced mestamacher sandwich with cheese, nuts, parsley 

or cucumber or tomato. A bit weird, but I love it and it's my default choice. I vary 
the 
variety of cheese and nut. Cashews are my favorite, but I don't want to get sick of 

them, so I alternate.

See <a href="http://www.mestemacher.de/fbio.html">http://www.mestemacher.de/fbio.html</a>

Text is in german, but you can see what the bread looks like. The supermarkets I've 

been to (In New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts) carry it.

And with whatever I'm having, I try to have a piece of fruit. Whatever's in season. 

Pineapple, as possibly the sweetest thing a no-esser is permitted during the week, is 

much appreciated.

And remember, come the weekend, you can have those stacks of pancakes doused in 

maple syrup.

&gt; Yes your right Reinhard,sugar free stuff is sometimes disgusting. I 
guess
&gt; that is part of the old dieting habits,I havebeen a member of weight
&gt; watchers off and on since 1994 . I currently feel that I will never go 
back
&gt; there mostly because I feel like i have been there done that.too many 
times.
&gt; I think this will work,it doesnt seem too hard to follow. I will have 
to
&gt; find some different things to eat,I am one of those very picky people 
and
&gt; for years before weight watchers thought i would never ever be able to 
lose
&gt; weight because im not a big veggie eater. I have found that to not be 
true
&gt; thankfully. I eat sugar all day and it will be the hardest thing for me. 
I
&gt; eat either pop tarts,sugary cereal or waffles for breakfast every 
morning.
&gt; Are eggs and such a good thing to have for breakfast? Is this a low 
fat
&gt; thing too? I am hearing eat what you want with the exception of sugar . So 
I
&gt; am trying to think of what all I CAN eat to substitute my normal fare.
&gt; Thanks for being so helpful,both Justin and Reinhard!!
&gt; Tay
