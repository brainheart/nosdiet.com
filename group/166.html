Thanks for the kind words, Bonnie, Kevin, Linda.

Kevin - I'm sorry your progress wasn't more
spectacular, but Linda is right: you have made
progress in terms of habits and self discipline, and
ultimately that's more important. Besides being less
sugar hungry, which I'm sure will pay dividends soon,
you've got a foundation of willpower on which to
build, and a much narrower range of suspects. Is it
big weekends that are the problem? Big firsts? Too
many exceptions? There are fewer variables. It's
easier to focus in now. You can fine tune.

As for exercise, I'd recommend just walking a lot
more. Not necessarily power walking or anything, but
just walking to places you ordinarily go instead of
driving or riding. It's useful, it's interesting, it's
kind of therapeutic, it's cheap, and you aren't going
to mess up your knees or anything.

&gt; Woohoo to you, Kevin! That's teriffic that you are
&gt; losing your taste for
&gt; sugars. Sooner or later, you will see the pounds
&gt; come off. In the
&gt; meantime, you are getting healthier and forming
&gt; better habits. And that, to
&gt; me, definitely counts as progress. :) Keep up the
&gt; good work.
&gt; 
&gt; I totally agree with your thanks to Reinhardt. 
&gt; Great site, great tips, good
&gt; people and always good for a chuckle or two.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've ran through a few hard times these last few
&gt; weeks, working 6 days a
&gt; week, 16 hours a day for at least 4, and 8 the
&gt; others doesn't promote good
&gt; eating, at least for me. I've found ways around
&gt; that..Changing weekend days
&gt; to Wed and Friday, the hardest days to get through
&gt; for me. Adding a couple
&gt; extra &quot;special&quot; days with a birthday and wedding in
&gt; there. I have not lost
&gt; weight yet, at all...Possibly because I don't get in
&gt; the exercise I should.
&gt; I squeeze in what I can, I carry the heavy boxes,
&gt; and give the light ones to
&gt; my assistants, I stay on my feet as much as
&gt; possible, but I just don't feel
&gt; the drive to do &quot;exercieses&quot; when I get home. 
&gt; Anyway, I have not bought pop
&gt; since I started the diet, and last night I had
&gt; grabbed a 24 oz pepsi from my
&gt; cousin, and couldn't even drink half of it. That
&gt; made me feel good.
&gt; I'd like to thank you once again for sharing your
&gt; diet ideas for one and
&gt; all,
&gt; and not try to market it in a book and call yourself
&gt; a professor of
&gt; Dietology. So thanks! And hopefully I'll start
&gt; seeing those pounds fall
&gt; off
&gt; since my appitite for the sugars has gone down.

&gt; &gt; glad to hear all is back to normal. Have been away
&gt; and for a while made
&gt; &gt; every day an S day. My neice said she lost a lot
&gt; on weight watchers,
&gt; &gt; and they allow a little sugar, but that was too
&gt; much effort in
&gt; &gt; weighing, planning, and my life is too busy. The
&gt; no S diet is the
&gt; &gt; easiest and does seem to work for me. Bonnie

Hi,

My big problemis still pop. Since I don't smoke my pop calms me. Im like Kevin and I 
think I am starting to not want sugar. I went to DQ and got a Praline Sunday and 
throw over half of it away. I hurt my back so I couldn't do the shovel glove. But I 
did walk 30 min. every morning. I lost 5 pounds last week but I'm not for sure 
now.









Tammy
