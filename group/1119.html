No, I had enough foresight to have divested my apartment of &quot;bad&quot;
foods. The problem is at work, where there are ALWAYS sweets and
snacks to be found. But I figure that short of becoming a hermit, I
will need to learn to be around those sorts of things without having
to indulge, so what better time to start than now?

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm 30 years old, and have been overweight ever since the age of 10 
or
&gt; so. I was a geek back then (still am, in fact), and dealt with the
&gt; social ostracism by turning to food for comfort. I got over my lack
&gt; of social skills, but the habit of turning to food for comfort and
&gt; entertainment remained. To make a long story short, I now weigh 340
&gt; pounds. I knew I was heavy, but I was pretty much in denial, until 
I
&gt; performed a couple of songs on a local access show about a year ago. 

&gt; Seeing myself on video was a wake-up call. I mean, I know they say
&gt; that the camera adds 10 pounds - so just how many cameras did they
&gt; have on me?!? 
&gt; 
&gt; Over the years, I've tried Aktins, Weight Watchers, etc, but found
&gt; that I couldn't stick to them for more than a couple of months. And
&gt; each time, I've had the rebound effect, where I've gained back more
&gt; than what I lost.
&gt; 
&gt; I found the No S Diet through a friend's blog - he had linked to the
&gt; Shovelglove page, which in turn led me here. It immediately struck 
me
&gt; as being right for me. Despite being fat for so much of my life, I've
&gt; never tried to dodge responsibility for it - I've always acknowledged
&gt; that it's because I eat too much of the wrong things, and I'm pretty
&gt; sedentary. So the No S Diet's emphasis on personal responsibility
&gt; appeals to me. I don't know how easy it will be to reprogram 20 years
&gt; worth of bad habits, but this seems like the most rational approach 
to
&gt; doing so that I've yet found.
&gt; 
&gt; So today was my first day on the No S Diet, and it has been
&gt; successful. I never realized just how ingrained my habit of snacking
&gt; was, until I had to repeatedly stop myself from picking up a candy
&gt; bar, bag of chips, etc. But each time, I managed to stop myself. I
&gt; suspect that as I become more aware of this habit, it will become 
a
&gt; lot easier to resist.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm looking forward to continuing in one of the best diet
&gt; plans I've seen. As a former programmer, I think that Reinhard has
&gt; indeed found the right level of abstraction for the problem.
&gt;
