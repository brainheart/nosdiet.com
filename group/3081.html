&gt; I was wondering if anyone else on the list is a fresh fruit / 
vegetable juicer? 
&gt; If so, I was wondering if you count the ingredients of your juice 

as part of the &quot;plate&quot; you're allowed, per meal. 
For example, this morning I juiced two grapefuits and an orange, and 
drank this along side my bowl of Kashi cereal w/ soy milk and a 
piece of 20-whole grain toast w/ butter. Does that sound like more 
than a plate of food? 
I guess that doesn't seem like a lot of food if you're having a 3-
egg omelette, six pieces of bacon, toast, and coffee, right? 

....Hi Nathan :)
That certainly does sound delicious! I will give you the unofficial 
answer, which means my &quot;opinion&quot;, which may not be precisely what 

will work for you...
I think it is too much for breakfast...Now, guys tend to need more 
calories than women, etc... blah blah...
Question to you... How overweight are you anyway.. by your own 
personal standards, not standards ala People magazines skinniest 
anorexics guide to starvation...
If you have weight to lose, this to me seems a little much calories 
wise and even NoS wise... Now Reinhard is going to say, &quot;overload 

your plate at the beginning&quot;... This is what I would consider an 
overloaded (albeit with very healthy food) &quot;plate&quot;...
Most people who have cereal, don't have a &quot;regulation&quot; bowl, and 

it's really easy to be taking in lots of calories like that... Use 
your own good judgement in terms of making the portions big enough 
to satisfy you, but remember not to fool yourself... If you are 
already questioning and wondering if it's too much, maybe it is.
As for me.. My portions took a good 4 or 5 months to come down 
from &quot;Overloading status&quot;.... but I was overloading quite often in 

the beginning, and I didn't gain, just didn't lose much... That was 
pretty much my goal for Winter anyway, so I'm not disappointed...
I won't make any culinary suggestions as to which food you might 
want to include in your &quot;brunch&quot; or &quot;lunch&quot; meal, but I think 

probably something should be relocated onto another &quot;plate&quot; :)
If you have been eating 5 eggs and 4 strips of bacon with pancakes 
and creamery butter, then what you are eating now, is definitely an 
improvement! But don't forget, unless you are Veggie, those foods 
are NoS friendly, just watch the portions.... mmmm I am now very 
hungry for lunch...
Where's that bacon!? LOL
Love and Welcome,
Deb
