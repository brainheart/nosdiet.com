Hi guys, my name is Sanjay and I came across the nosdiet website a 
few weeks ago. I liked the straightforward style and simplicity of 
the plan. It also seemed easy to stick to. I gave it a shot last week 
and it went well until Friday. I was sick last week so it helped 
because my appetite had decreased anyway. Anyway, Friday night, I 
went out to to eat and had dessert as well. Also, Sat. night, I had 
dessert as well. I figured this is ok because its still two days out 
of the week as Sunday (today) I am strict again. With my schedule, 
Friday and Sat. seem easier to cheat on than Sat. and Sun. My 
question is that does anyone else feel guilty or like they are 
overeating even during the week? Even when you know that you are 
being pretty strict? I am used to dieting and so this eating well 
regularly kind of throws me for a loop as weird as that might sound. 
This morning I stepped on the scale and it showed that I had gained 4 
lbs.! Now I know that it's not possible and that its probably water 
fluctuation, but I am still freaked out that maybe 1 out of that 4 is 
real weight gain? Should I just stop looking at the scale for a few 
weeks (until after the third week when this is supposed to become 
habit?). 

More about me:

22 yr. male, 5'8-5'9

172 lbs. 

Former fatty, now trying to get to 150 lbs and 10% bodyfat. 

Just joined the gym as well and trying to go regularly. This won't be 
a problem for me because I don't mind working out.
