&gt; Deb you are killing me with the descriptions of donuts/begguents 
SP?? I quickly passed by the Krispy Kreme counter last night with 
13 yo in tow saying MOOOOM please.no way its not an s day i told her.

....Good control Jool, maybe next time sidestep the whole issue by 
taking an alternate route which doesn't include passing the &quot;valley 

of donut&quot; death...
Yes, thanks to Beignets and Po Boys, plus unlimited evening visits 
to buy crap at convenience stores, I had a cholesterol level of 
about 350 after living down there and going &quot;hog wild&quot; for 2 
years.
When I returned to NY, even when I was still heavy, since my dietary 
intake of fat and sugar was so much less, within one year my 
cholesterol went down over 100 points, still not perfect, but much 
less likely to have a coronary....

Okay a different thread for today. She had a horrible day yesterday 
in school boys making fun of her big breasts and that her teeth are 
&gt; a bit crooked(braces in the spring). Poor thing, 13,5'8 and 
&gt; 38C,blonde nordic blue eyes. I told her in a few years the boys 
wont be making fun of her, they will be ogling her. Why do they have 
to be so stupid? 

...Why does the sky have to be blue? Kids in general can be really 
hurtful to each other, I wouldn't relive childhood if you paid me.
Usually, any hurtful criticism is somehow a projection of your own 
feelings of inadequacy or low self esteem... I asked my son Richard 
what his take on your busty daughters plight was, esp. with regard 
to your question &quot;why do they (boys) need to be so stupid&quot;, hoping 

to get an inside scoop from a budding young man, not so completely 
uninterested in the fairer sex...(he acts so cute in front of the 
girls in his yoga class, which started 3 weeks ago, he's the only 
boy. He almost blushes around them!)
This is what he told me to write to you... The response is a classic 
mix of universal wisdom, and 8 year old knowledge of anatomy...
He said:

&quot;Most people say things about other people, but they are thinking 

that way about themselves...So those guys must think that they have 
big nipples!&quot; 
LOL

Did you ever hear about the kind of guys who flirt with the girls 
they like by &quot;pulling their pigtails&quot; and other juvennaile forms of 

adoration? Let her know that, most likely, they are just nerdy, zit 
covered, immature morons, who actually just don't know how to behave 
around such obvious beauty, so they act like idiots just to get her 
attention.

Have a nice weekend :)
Peace and Love
Deb
