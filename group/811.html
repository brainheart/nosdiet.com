Hi Sophie,

Self deception is a given. Don't beat yourself up
about it. Just be alert, and remember who to suspect
if things aren't working :-).

I don't think skipping meals is a good idea. Even if
it works out every now and then, it's bad for habit
formation. Pace yourself, not just in body but also in
mind.

I think it's hilarious (but great!) that mcdonalds is
given away pedometers with their happy meals. See?
They don't want to make you fat, they just want to
make money. I may just have to head over there
tomorrow and check this out. Since I walk pretty much
the same route every weekday, I'll only measure once,
so I don't care if the pedometer isn't particularly
high end.

&gt; Reinhard, Thanks for the suggestions. I may be
&gt; deceiving myself about how 
&gt; long I 've been doing nos and perhaps about what's
&gt; on that plate! Self-deception 
&gt; can be a major problem with overweight. Meanwhile I
&gt; am down two and a half 
&gt; pounds again so I just have to see but I am sticking
&gt; with this because it is so 
&gt; much better than the way I was eating before --
&gt; little snacks off and on 
&gt; through the day and rarely really having a proper
&gt; meal and yet gaining or 
&gt; maintaining extra pounds. This way of eating is so
&gt; much saner. What's your feeling 
&gt; about skipping a meal if you're not hungry if it
&gt; doesn't lead to a cycle of 
&gt; snacking? 
&gt; Hana, Thank you for you comments. I was on Atkins
&gt; for a long time and do 
&gt; tend to think of fats as &quot;free&quot; and though they are
&gt; not forbidden on nos like 
&gt; anything else they can be overdone!
&gt; Does anyone know of an easy- to- program (cheap)
&gt; pedometer?????
&gt; Thanks again, Sophie
