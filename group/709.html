I have 3 Italian greyhounds. The sick one is the grandmother of the tribe
and is just coming up to her 14th birthday. I also have a grown up daughter,
just completing her teaching degree.I teach biology , chemistry and physics.
Science is compulsory here in Britain along with Maths and English, so 
we
get a lot of students who come just because they have to.I work in a
designated Technology college and we have hundreds of computers for the 
kids
to use. I took the class to a computer suite to work with a brilliant
American schools website on the function of the heart . it shows clear
simulations, but a couple of them amused themselves by sending obscene
e-mails. They have their own hotmail accounts which the computer services
department cannot monitor or block. If I can find who started the game I 
can
get their internet rights revoked.The real problem with these kids is that
so many come from poor homes. Not material poverty, but poverty of spirit
and care. They believe that soap opera is real life and that designer labels
and the right mobile phone(cellphone) are the most important things in 
life.

&gt; Dear Hana,
&gt; Sorry to hear about your dogs illness. I have two Goldens and they 
are
&gt; like children to me, my two kids are grown and moved out now. I remember
&gt; when my daughter took Spanish in high school, and to keep it interesting
the
&gt; teacher would ask them to watch a TV show, General Hospital at the 
time
,and
&gt; they would discuss it in class next day but in Spanish! What are you
&gt; teaching?
&gt; I got a bad report on my blood pressure yesterday,145-90,
&gt; so I must be even more care ful now with my sat fat and salt!

&gt; I have been struggling to lose for weeks I have increased the total 
amount
&gt; of food over the last couple of days and lost a couple of pounds. I 
am
still
&gt; keeping my blood sugars as they should be.I haven't exercised much 
this
week
&gt; either, my little dog is ill with heart failure and I had to rush her 
to
the
&gt; vet, which took out a whole afternoon and I have been very tired from
work.
&gt; I teach one class per day and they are horrible and don't want to 
work.
The
&gt; best ideas for interesting lessons get nowhere. That is so dispiriting.
