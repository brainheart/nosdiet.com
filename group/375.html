&gt; Hi dangalishus,
&gt; 
&gt; First off, give yourself some credit, it sounds like
&gt; you've licked 2 out of three esses. That's a good in
&gt; itself, and a foundation on which to build. You are in
&gt; better shape to tackle the final S than you were
&gt; before.
&gt; 
&gt; My advice is: 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) get the cheese nips etc. out of the house. If you
&gt; want to indulge on s-days, buy a small amount so you
&gt; don't have leftovers to tempt you.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) give yourself decent sized meals so you aren't so
&gt; hungry for snacks. Until you know just the right
&gt; amount it takes, it's ok to make the meals a little
&gt; too large at first. Once you have the discipline of no
&gt; snacking in place it's relatively easy to fine tune
&gt; the portions.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) if somehow #1 and #2 don't work on any given day,
&gt; drop the crackers and nips and stick with the fruits.
&gt; It's not officially &quot;ok,&quot; rules-wise, to snack on
&gt; fruit, but it's officially &quot;much better&quot; than the
&gt; alternatives.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Drink more water, drink tea. Drink anything except
&gt; sugar water. It's astonishing what a difference this
&gt; can make.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) bug us if none of this works
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I have definitely taken the sugars away and even on
&gt; &gt; the weekends when 
&gt; &gt; I can eat a debbie cake, I don't have it and I
&gt; &gt; pretty much anything I 
&gt; &gt; want. I have stayed away from the sodas as well. 
&gt; &gt; For me not to have 
&gt; &gt; a soda is a miracle that i could not entail before,
&gt; &gt; but that is also 
&gt; &gt; doing good for me. However, the snacking has
&gt; &gt; diminshed to a point, 
&gt; &gt; but I didn't think about it a few minutes ago when I
&gt; &gt; just bought and 
&gt; &gt; ate those cheese nips, the little bag to go. My
&gt; &gt; snacks consists of 
&gt; &gt; wheat crackers and white crackers and fruit. How do
&gt; &gt; I get out of 
&gt; &gt; this mode gang. Please help. I am not having
&gt; &gt; seconds either. I 
&gt; &gt; feel like I am doing so much better, but I also feel
&gt; &gt; I am on the 
&gt; &gt; wrong band-wagon. Any adice would surely help. 
&gt; &gt; Please direct me in 
&gt; &gt; the path I should go.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt;

try. Thanks
