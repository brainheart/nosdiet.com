Dear Group,

All was going well until I went out for the first time in months to a 
Valentine's dinner dance last night. While waiting for the food to come, I toyed 

with the little silver and red foil wrapped chocolates scattered across the 

table. After all, it was an S-day, right? Besides, I was feeling so good 

after several No S weeks with modest weekends, thanks to my dear husband who 

bought only what I put on the list while I recuperated from bronchial 
pneumonia.

Soon I was out of control and didn't even know it until I was looking around 

for more, and by then I didn't care, for myself, but started sneaking 
because of those around me.

Ate dinner, followed by cake and coffee and before leaving stuffed another 

piece of cake in a plastic cup for tomorrow, which I ate as soon as I got home 

even though I felt uncomfortably full. Slept fitfully until 4 a.m., and now 

I'm paying the price with rumbling and discomfort for what I did to myself 

in three hours of self indulgence.

Here's what I wrote to the old familiar tune:

Candy and cake
Candy and cake 
My stomach is feeling sick from eating 
Candy and cake

Sugar and fat
Why'd I do that?
I'm oh so sick from eating too much
Candy and cake.

Welcome new members, hope you don't do as I did.
May everyone go S-easy today.

Love,

Ginny
