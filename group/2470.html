Hey All, Is it my imagination or is this time of year a tad stress 
producing? :) LOL! I just can't wait for Spring to come.. This 
Winter is feeling pretty lousey so far for me :(
Well yesterday was an S day for me and Richard... We were supposed 
to go to an annual music and food party last night at a friend of 
mine who I've known since first grade... Usually we all eat drink 
and play music all night long, as all of her friends are musicians 
and it just turns into a big jam session... well I am sick *again*!!!
Not doing well this winter, getting slammed every few weeks with a 
cold, flu or cough... so now it's my throat...raw sore painful, 
swolen glands...Ach!!!
I called my friend to double check whether she felt like sickies 
should stay home, or just not hug and kiss, and she told me that she 
is in the early stages of being pregnant, and then politely hinted 
that she would rather not get anything from me.... point taken, and 
since I felt so lousy it almost was a relief for me as well, but 
Richard, well he just started to cry...who could blame him?
I even had it all set up so that he could be absent from school if 
we were up *really* late, since he is such a great student, his 
teacher just said &quot;go and have fun&quot;... I felt so sad for him, and 

didn't want to be &quot;all dressed up with nowhere to go&quot; so we just 

decided to make it a family video night with all the accompaniments 
which are definitely not NDay approved... Nachos and Slurpees (evil, 
evil) Even the video we rented was anti-NoS,,,,The old cartoon 
series, *Fat* Albert! :)
Wow, I really noticed that my mood shifted after 2 minutes of 
sipping on the slurpees... I was cracking more jokes etc...Richard 
went back to his Michael Flatley impersonation once we got home...
So back on the &quot;N-wagon&quot; today and wishing all a happy week...
Peace and Love,
Deb :)
