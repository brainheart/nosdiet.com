&quot;Typical&quot; is too hard to say, wishful thinking is
bound to intrude, but here's what I had this weekend,
as far as I can remember. It's not perfect, but it's
not crazily excessive either. Sunday I probably ate a
bit less than usual (somehow missed a proper lunch). I
used to eat way more than this every day, and my s
days in the beginning were also much worse, so don't
be depressed if your s days are much worse than this
right now. It takes a while. I drink a lot of water,
often with some lemon or lime squeezed in. I don't
mention that below.

Saturday Feb 28

8 AM Breakfast:
2 fried eggs
1 slice toasted mestemacher black bread
2 chicken sausage links
1 cup black coffee
Fresh squeezed juice from 1 grapefruit

10 AM Snack:
1 white peach

1 PM Lunch:
Some plantain chips, tortilla chips, and salsa (not a
whole lot).
1 haas avocado
1/2 pineapple (now this is a lot)

4 PM Coffee break:
1 &quot;copenhagen&quot; (a fancy danish that I particularly
like)
1 individual apple tart
1 cup black coffee

7 PM Dinner:
1 dinner roll
1 sauted chicken filet
2 generous helpings mashed potatoes
2 helpings steamed spinach
2 glasses red wine (los vascos, my favorite)

&gt; Since there has been lots of discussion recently
&gt; regarding what s-
&gt; days look like, I would like to know something. I
&gt; know that 
&gt; technically, the s-days have no rules whatsoever,
&gt; but could you, 
&gt; Reinhard, give us a typical day's menu for one of
&gt; *your* s-days? Just 
&gt; for example. Tell us the exact foods you eat,
&gt; quantities, # of times 
&gt; per day, hour of the day, snacks, treats, etc. We
&gt; all know that over 
&gt; time, the habits formed on the no-s days will bleed
&gt; over into your 
&gt; behavior on the s-days, so we would (or at least I
&gt; would) like to 
&gt; know how that has shaped your own habits on the
&gt; s-days.
&gt; 
&gt; As always, thank you so much for creating this forum
&gt; and supporting 
&gt; us all.
