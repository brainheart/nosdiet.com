Hello Dawn and welcome to the group,
I had to reply since you said you are an aspiring fiction writer. I was able to stay 
home fulltime in 1999 to dedicate myself to my writing. (And I immediately gained ten 
pounds) My first inspirational fiction book Streams of Mercy came out this summer. 
Ever since, I have been busy with promotion. In fact, today I had an interview with a 
radio station in London, England. Exciting!!!!!!!! At one point I almost forgot the 
title of my book. Tonight I have a book signing and author discussion at a library. 
They are always fun.

Best of luck with your writing and NoS. In the past if I had something to 
celebrate--like my radio interview--I would think of going out to dinner and gorging 
on something special. Now I try to resist that urge. There are so many more 
beneficial ways to celebrate. Actually, the event should be celebration enuf. 


Peace,
Teresa Slack

Hello everyone!

I just found the NoS diet and started it Monday. So far so good. I look forward to 
those S days, though : ). 

A little about me--I'm a stay at home mom to a school age daughter and a wannabe 
fiction author. I just finished my first manuscript and am in the editing stage now. 
We'll see if it ever gets published.

Debbie, in regard to your question about the 21 days--I believe this is the time 
limit for exercise to become ingrained as well. I'm not sure where the 21 days/three 
weeks comes from, but &quot;they&quot; (who are these people? : ) say that three 
weeks is how long it takes to make something habitual. I know it works very well for 
exercise, but not sure with this eating plan. I guess I'll find out. 

I exercise regularly, at least an hour a day and do both cardio and strength training 
via ballet, Callanetics, The Bar Method, Lotte Berk, etc. I try not to use weights 
because I tend to build muscle very quickly and get a bulky look that I do not like. 


Anyway, that's all I'll bore you with today. I have about 11.5 pounds more to lose to 
reach my minimal goal weight, and 21.5 to reach my ideal goal weight. I like to set 
reachable goals and then up the bar once I get there.

Much peace and strength to all!

Dawn

Hey Reinhard, I was wondering about something...Please don't take 
this in any way, as a challenge to your theories, as it is not that, 
but I have been wondering where you came up with the 3 week theory 
of &quot;forming a habit&quot;, I seem to be resisting this for some reason 

and I can't put my finger on why...I will look over your original 
NoS document for the answer, but if you have a moment and feel up to 
it, could you provide your rationale...If it's not particularly 
scientific I don't really care, but I am the kind of person, who 
disects stuff to make sense of it...and I feel it would help me 
completely embrace the 3 week regimen better, if I really knew 
the &quot;why&quot; behind that number. If you say, &quot;I pulled it out of a 

hat&quot; or &quot;I just like things that come in threes&quot; I will 

wholeheartedly accept it...but for some weird reason, I am feeling 
like I am missing an important part of the puzzle.
Thank you in advance!
Peace and Love,
Debbie :)
