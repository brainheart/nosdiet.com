&gt; One of my biggest resolutions this year is no matter if 
I try and lose weight or not, to not criticize my body but 
especially in front of my children. I do not want my children 
criticizing their own bodies growing up, I want them to be happy 
with their own unique body types, and respect that there are all 
shapes and sizes of people in the world. I am not even using the 
term &quot;diet&quot; around them, just &quot;eating program&quot; or &quot;exercise 

program&quot;. Funny thing is this is very hard to do, I am so used to 

putting myself down and talking about this or that weight loss plan.

Okay folks one more little round of ammunition for the morning then 
I'm out, promise :)
Beth :)
Don't make yourself too neurotic. One of the real truisms which 
isn't a cliche, about raising kids to have self esteem, make good 
choices, be open minded and not prejudiced, is (the opposite of)
&quot;Do what I say not what I do&quot;...
Hmmm couldn't think of a good way to phrase that, but you get my 
drift...so if you say diet, it's not as important as actually 
*having* a healthy diet! Maybe then, your kids will grow up thinking
&quot;My diet is very healthy&quot; as opposed to the commercialized, negative 

form of use of that word...Your actions say more than your words, so 
focus on that, which I'm sure you are already...As far as having a 
good self image, all I can say is, Love Love Love and Praise Praise 
Praise...When a kid hears how wonderful they are and loved they are 
and gets kisses and hugs aplenty, even when they are a little bit 
naughty (hee hee) they grow up to love and respect themselves... 
Seeing you do a good thing for yourself will have a profound impact 
on their own choices :) 
Your behavior and choices are so important in not only the formative 
years of their life, but always...It's an awesome responsibility, 
but a great one...No parent is perfect, but your kids will always, 
especially when they are young, look up to you and you are their 
hero!
PS.. My son does NoS with me :) I allow him about three S's a week, 
but that's better than 7 or 10 or 19 etc....
He likes it!
Love,
Deb
