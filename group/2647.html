&gt; I am feeling particulary desperate to lose some
&gt; weight right now 
&gt; because I'm getting married in Hawaii in June and
&gt; want to look good 
&gt; in my wedding dress. I'm a size 12 and weigh about
&gt; 170. I'm tall 
&gt; and would like to take off about 25-30 pounds.

I got an email last week from a woman who lost 55
pounds on no-s in 2004. It can be done. But
psychologically you'll want to keep the focus longer
term. By longer term I mean life. Not only is this the
more important term, but staying focused on it will in
all probability also get you better 6 month results.
Desperation can be a great motivator, but it's also
dangerous. It's a great kick in the pants to get you
started, but it spikes fast, you've got to smooth that
desperate energy into longer term attention. How do
you do this? Measure your initial progress in terms of
days on habit rather than pounds. There is no question
that if you can manage the days, the days will take
care of the pounds. But since the days are *directly*
under your control, the only way you can fail is by
choice. Choice is hard, but it's what it comes down to
in any case, and so you might as well start by
admitting this fact. You can step on the same scale in
a single day 3 different times and get three different
numbers. That can throw you. You can eat well and not
see it register immediately, or go up a pound despite
your efforts. That can throw you even more.
Behaviorally you've succeeded, but metrically, you've
failed. That can't happen if the behavior *is* the
metric. You can't snack and not snack. You can't have
seconds and not have seconds. You can't have a
snickers bar and not. You do or you don't. There are
no surprises. There is no one to throw you but
yourself (and yourself is plenty, believe me).

&gt; I
&gt; know deep down that 
&gt; dieting is not the answer and I really feel like
&gt; this program can 
&gt; give me the tools to re-train my willpower which has
&gt; been nonexistent 
&gt; in the last several years.

A little willpower builds a little habit which builds
a little more willpower, etc. People go to the gym
*because* they're weak, not because they're strong.
They go to get strong. Weakness isn't an excuse not
to, it's the reason why. Same thing here.

To push gym analogy a little further: no one starts
out benching 200 pounds. You start with just the bar,
maybe, and gradually work your way up. If your
willpower just gets you through a few days (or one
day, or one meal) on nos to start and then you fail,
don't despair. Try to go one day more for the next
stretch, then one day more, etc. Unlike the gym, you
won't have to do this forever. There will come a point
when habit, like an invisible spotter, will carry most
of the burden for you. It'll sit there in the gym
doing a million reps while you are free to move about
and worry about other stuff.

&gt; This is surely the wackiest website i have
&gt; encountered.Also it's so 
&gt; simple that it should work.

I'm not sure if no-s would make anyone's absolute
&quot;wackiest&quot; list (there is some strange stuff out
there), but I hope it's a contender for &quot;wackiest that
is also generally useful.&quot; 

&gt; So i am in as of now , i have had all my 
&gt; stray questions or quests for info met by the
&gt; website and i am 
&gt; looking forward to feeling good.
&gt; Regards.

Let us know if anything else occurs to you. And keep
us posted as to your progress.

Best to you both,

Reinhard
