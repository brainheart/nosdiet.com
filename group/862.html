Hi Melanie,

Congratulations! I look forward to the day I can have a happy dance
too. And your happiness is really is an encouragement for us. We know
we can all look forward to a happy dance!

Right now I am trying hard, not too successful yet but there is some
improvement. I cut down on seconds, which I think is the hardest for
me. However, I move towards sweets, eating more sweet stuff than ever
before. Trying to cut that too!

My weight is more or less stablized. But the tens of pounds Reinhard
has talked about is still as far as the sky!

Congratulations again, way to go Melanie.

Congratulations, Melanie. You know, I bet the happy
dance burns calories :-). 

I don't want to punch a hole in your morale, but do be
aware that it is normal to fluctuate a few pounds, and
that household scales are not precision instruments.
So while this certainly isn't bad news, keep your best
hopes invested longer term and larger scale: months
and tens of pounds. Otherwise I'm afraid we might hear
about a sad dance soon, and that might really throw
you.

But as long as you keep that in mind, feel free to
brag about every little triumph. Encouragement always
helps, and any kind of loss is a great pretext to ask
for some.

Cautiously optimistic,

Reinhard

&gt; I stepped on the scale yesterday. I am down another
&gt; 2lbs from last
&gt; week. Am I happy? You betcha. =) I was so happy, I
&gt; couldn't stop
&gt; myself from dancing. I did a happy dance in front of
&gt; the scale and all
&gt; around the house. My husband thought for sure I had
&gt; finally snapped,
&gt; and he was going to need to admit me into the funny
&gt; farm. Anyway have
&gt; a great day all. Your friend in health, Melanie
