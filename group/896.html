Hi 
Thanks for the advice. It sounds like good advice too. But unfortunately it sounds 
like you would have to have a sane life to do this. My life is very insane. That is 
why some of the s stuff is really a challenge for me.

Hey Maxine, 
I know I'm new here so I hope you won't mind me
pitching in on your weighing dilemna. 

I picked up a great tip from the Carbohydrate Addict's
book by Rachel Heller. As our weight can fluctuate
greatly throughout the day and even from day to day,
she suggests weighing yourself every day, at the same
time each day, wearing the same thing every day. Then,
AVERAGE those weights over the course of a week. This
will give you a more accurate representation of weight
lost over the long term, which is what we want, right?


I tried this and kept plenty of notes, recording my
weight on a legal notepad. I was really surprised to
see that my weight had been going down steadily by a
pound or so, on average, every week since I started
exercising a couple months ago. I would have been
aware of this only if I had watched it long term, as
on a day to day basis it was hard to tell if I was
gainin, losing, or maintaining.

Sorry to run on so long for such a simple suggestion.
I hope it helps.

Later.

&gt; Hi Maxine,
&gt; 
&gt; I share the same challenge as you. If my weight
&gt; comes down, i thk
&gt; mmm... i can eat more. And if it goes up, what the
&gt; hack, forget about
&gt; being fat.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now, i try to forget about the weigh and start
&gt; to eat less. Cut
&gt; down on seconds and snacks. Still taking sweets as
&gt; desserts.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have a solution for the weigh issue for you.
&gt; But i really
&gt; think you are on the right path. So keep it up.
&gt; After awhile, you will
&gt; be able to feel your weight without a weigh. You
&gt; know if it has gone
&gt; up or come down.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi
&gt; &gt; I have stopped weighing myself for right now. I
&gt; use to do it every week
&gt; when I went to my tops meetings but with school and
&gt; work it just has become
&gt; almost impossible to attend the meetings and since
&gt; you have to pay even if
&gt; you go or not I'm finding it probably not worth the
&gt; money. I don't want to
&gt; bring a scale into my home because then I am too
&gt; tempted to weigh myself
&gt; everyday. And my tendencies are if I loose weight I
&gt; think wow I can eat
&gt; more and if I don't loose weight I get depressed and
&gt; eat more. Does anyone
&gt; have any advice to how they weigh themselves. I'm
&gt; trying to find a place
&gt; that has a scale that I wouldn't mind going to once
&gt; a week.
&gt; &gt; Maxine
