Yes Mike : ) I also love the feeling I have right now of being able to make 

good choices and eliminate that old eating on &quot;unconscious&quot; autopilot. I am 

a massage therapist and the beauty of our bodies is that inherently they do 

want to be healthy and give us many signs that things could be out of 
balance. When we don't listen to our own signals, for example our stomachs 

being full or maybe being in pain, possibly due to dragging our carcasses 

around at a less than optimum weight, eventually we wind up hurting 
ourselves, being depressed and just everything, well for a lack of a better 

word, sucking!
Reinhard gave us a reminder to really respect ourselves and take care of 

ourselves in a clear, empowering, simple and liberating way.
God gave us free will. No government, dark force, secret agency, can tell 

us how to use it, especially in terms of our bodies. We must be respectful 

and responsible for that ourselves.
When you really think about it, this is all about bringing consciousness and 

choice into our lives.
When we stuff ourselves (and believe me I have been &quot;putting it away&quot; now 

for a year and really wanted to end this &quot;shovelling&quot; and gorging but 

couldn't face another &quot;diet&quot;, and ps now can you believe that even Burger 

King is spoofing that whole short fix diet industry in its commercials, you 

know &quot;Dr. Angus&quot;....It's really a joke) we are totally not exhibiting free 

will or choices....It is pure autopilot and just plain old bad habit. When 

we really go with the things our bodies need and truly make an effort to 

think before we &quot;stuff&quot; we are communicating with our inherent wisdom and 

that can never steer you in a wrong direction. As a result we feel more 

alive and in tune with the flow of life, instead of that &quot;dead&quot; feeling, 

that depressed and totally apathetic feeling.
Nice to share feelings with you all and I welcome any inspirational thoughts 

or anecdotes you may have :)

I will leave you with one nice idea I utilized years ago when going it alone 

on diet #1. It is fully compatible with &quot;No S&quot; lifestyle, and I picked it 

up from an audiotape by the then editor of Prevention Magazine, Mark 
Brickman, I think....Here it is.

When you have a &quot;setback&quot; don't let it bring you down, instead
embrace it, welcome it, be proud of it...
Only people going somewhere have setbacks,
Successful people have setbacks,
Setbacks are for people on their way to a better place.
You will keep moving forward if you think of them that way, so don't guilt 

yourself out if you have a setback along the way : )
Good luck to all and I am happy to be sharing this experience with you!
Peace,
Debbie Feder

&gt;Hello Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; Welcome all of you new comers. I am very proud to say that I
&gt;have been on Nos for almost a month now. I am really enjoying the
&gt;level of control that I have over what I chose to put in my body. I
&gt;truly believe in the lifestyle change.What I have really noticed is
&gt;that I use to eat so much to where the only time I thought I was
&gt;full was when I was completely stuffed. Now I only eat three meals 
a
&gt;day, one plate per meal and I am satisfied. I still cannot believe 
I
&gt;am doing this. The only other time in my life where I was able to
&gt;eat only three meals a day and no snacks was in military bootcamp,
&gt;which by the way was when I was in the best shape of my life.
&gt;Remember the system works only if you work it. I am really happy I
&gt;found Nos!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;Good luck to all,
&gt;Mike
&gt;
&gt;
