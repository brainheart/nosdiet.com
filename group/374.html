&gt; Great progress on 2 of 3 and poco a poco (bit by bit) on the 
third. 
&gt; For me, a life-long binger and that is over 50 years of it, 
changing 
&gt; my thinking comes before changing my behavior. I can get hungry 
&gt; (ravenous in fact, obsessed in fact) if I slip back into thinking I 

&gt; can never have this particular food again, usually sweets or 
&gt; carbohydrates. That was old diet thinking and old diet splitting 
of 
&gt; foods into good food/bad food lists. I would compound the whole 
&gt; process by not eating enough for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and 
then 
&gt; still being hungry at night (not a good thing) or by not eating 
&gt; during the day and binging at night (again not a good thing). For 

&gt; me, this is a process and I am always tacking back to the target. 

I 
&gt; am grateful the holidays are over and this is Monday and back to 
&gt; regular eating. Try eating more at mealtimes, especially protein 
and 
&gt; vegetables with some whole grains like brown rice or even starchier 

&gt; vegetables like yams to keep your blood sugar level and maybe snack 

&gt; on a salad or fruit like the boss says until you can go without, 
and 
&gt; then remember the weekend cometh to quench the sugar and snack food 

&gt; hungers. Best of luck. It sounds like you are on your way to a 
new 
&gt; way of life.



Thanks, I really appreciate your help and the bosses' too. I truely 
believe this os the one diet that can and WILL help me loose those 25 
lbs I want to loose. I have already traded two s-days. (Silly me) 
I can do this! My other biggie is...with three children, all getting 
ready for school in the mornings, i don't have time for breakfast and 
that is usually when the cheese and crackers comes in when i am 
working. I have never been a breakfast person anyways but any 
suggestions on a quick fix would help. I think this is either week 
three for me or going on week three and i do commend myself for doing 
very well but i can do much better. I get on that darn scale almost 
every morning and i see no weight loss. It some times discourages me 
but someone told me it took a while to gain it and it will be a while 
to loose. I guess sometimes i wanna see fast results. I guess it 
would help if i exercise too. FOrgot to mention i have not been 
doing that either. I do however intend to start my Walk Away the 
Pounds dvd on tonight when i get home from work. Thanks Chloe.
