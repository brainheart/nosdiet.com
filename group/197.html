A) Congratulations on your decision to lose the
weight. You won't be sorry.

B) You shouldn't set such an ambitious goal. Anything
over and above about two pounds per week is generally
too fast to be maintainable. If you try for it, you're
going to lose muscle and slow your metabolism. This
means that your body's going to fight back,
agressively, against your attempts to change it.
Behold the magic of Homeostasis. Try for 40 lbs by
April or so--your fat loss will slow as you get closer
to your goal. Count on it. 

C)In terms of losing weight quickly, I would reccomend
1)Regular exercise to go along with your diet
(Reinhard's advice about the shovelglove and &quot;Urban
Ranger,&quot; though somewhat unusual, is nonetheless quite
effective.) This should include (ready for more
&quot;S's?&quot;) Strength-Training, Stretching, and Stamina
(cardiovascular) exercises. 
2) Add an additional &quot;S&quot; and take out &quot;starches&quot;.
Yeah, I know that Reinhard is anti-Atkins, but the
studies coming out now are more in support than
against the guy. Eat a lot of meats and veggies. Eat
less fruits and nuts (but still some). Cut back on the
dairy, starches and sweets considerably.
3) Only take one &quot;S&quot; day per week. Eat whatever you
please, but make sure that it pleases you. Don't eat a
bunch of crap &quot;because you can&quot;. Oh, and with the
Holidays coming up, make sure to plan ahead for
Thanksgiving, Christmas, Kwanzaa, or what-have-you.
Make your &quot;S&quot; day one of those days on those weeks. 

D) Keep us updated on your progress. People who are
responsible to others tend to stick with their
programs. Another good way to do this is to bet a
friend or significant other $50 (or more, if you have
it) that you will stick to your diet and exercise
program. It doesn't even have to be a &quot;bet&quot; per
se--the other person doesn't have to pay you anything.
Set the cash aside, and, if you keep the money, you
have to use it to buy a new pair of jeans that you can
now fit into, or something like that. If you lose it,
then you lost it. This seemingly insignificant thing
can make a big difference in terms of program
adherence.

E) Don't be afraid to ask questions!
