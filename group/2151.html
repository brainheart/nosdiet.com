I'm semi-new. I was lurking for a while before, and have decided to have
another go with nos and actually post this time.

My biggest starbucks addiction (I don't know if they do it outside the
UK) is the cheese and marmite toasted paninni. Looks like I'll be
finding excuses to go near a coffee shop at weekends :)

&gt;From looking at the calories (someone else posted them, I'm not sure 
if
the UK figures differ)

<a href="http://starbucks.co.uk/en-GB/_Favorite+Beverages/Nutritional+Information">http://starbucks.co.uk/en-GB/_Favorite+Beverages/Nutritional+Information</a>

They're all almost as bad as each other. And I fear the person who can
drink a Venti White Chocolate Mocha.

&gt; &gt; One question - where do people think starbucks coffee sits? It's 

&gt; clearly liquid calories, but it's also coffee and I'm not sure if 

&gt; it's anything other than milk and coffee, both of which are 
&gt; acceptable.

&gt; 
&gt; ....Hey Michael :) Are you new? If so, welcome :)
&gt; So, Starbucks &quot;coffee&quot;.....
&gt; I worked there for around 3 months during massage school. By the 
&gt; end of that job I was an unadulterated carb junkie...
&gt; Their &quot;coffee&quot; drinks with flavoring, like Mocha Lattes and 

&gt; Frappucinos are all super loaded with sugar. If we are talking, 
&gt; straight Latte or Cappucino, or good old Black coffee, you can 
&gt; certainly have it during NonS days. You can even use a bit of 
&gt; sugar. But beware...those others are, as you put it, &quot;liquid carbs&quot; 

&gt; and they will fatten you up mighty fast. Definite S'ses with a big 

&gt; S. So if you love them, save them for your S days, and while you're 

&gt; at it, Starbucks makes some of the best dark chocolate I have ever 

&gt; had... They are little pieces so unless you buy 5 of them, you can 

&gt; have a bit of candy and not go hog wild, but still enjoy a really 

&gt; good choco.... I can't stand Starbucks coffee, it makes my stomach 

&gt; go into knots.. (but the smell Rocks!) so I was lucky not to crave 

&gt; any of those sugary beverages while I was there...Unfortunately, I 

&gt; didn't do so well resisting the donuts or other cakes...
&gt; Have a good one.
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb
