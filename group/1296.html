Hi Lee, it's Debbie here...I think that you could tweak the system if=20
you call the hurricaine a &quot;Storm&quot; that starts with S!
Don't focus on the mistakes you make in the process. As I said to=20

as &quot;falling off&quot; the path to begin with, because you wouldn't have 
a=20

Welcome that setback and embrace it!
It means that you are going somewhere, not just settling to stay the=20

It takes a Herculean effort to keep your mind positive, but that will=20
make the difference. Most people gain weight when they are sad,=20
lonely or stressed...
Be a friend to yourself and congratulate yourself for every small=20
achievement...Including the setbacks.
That should pull you through some rough patches :)=20
PS Hurricaines are very stress producing, maybe you were just afraid=20
and looking for comfort in a candybar.
Be well,
Love
Debbie
