Are you trying to tell me something with that aphorism comment? I 
will try to be more &quot;Aphorismic&quot; in the future, lol!
I also find it hard to admit that the past generations of 
grandmothers whose mantra was &quot;chew your food&quot; knew something after 

all!
In actuality, I don't ever remember anyone with that common sense in 
my family. The mantra my Grandmother used to say, emphatically, was 
just...
&quot;EAT&quot; 
a very, typically Jewish way of approaching food.
As a kid growing up in my home here, mealtimes were less than 
tranquil. It was more like Woody Allens &quot;Take the money and Run&quot; 

where everyone was just raising their voice and yelling at each other 
until any possible good feeling about having food was completely 
obliterated.
I think I need a tranquilizer just remembering those good ol' days :)

&gt; hi deb
&gt; great minds think alike, but not all talk in aphorisms lol
&gt; I'm catching up on my posts in date order, and have just come 
across your
&gt; knowledgeable explanation of the brain delay thing.
&gt; 
&gt; The hypothalamus is the part of the brain which registers if we 
are
&gt; hungry or thirsty, empty or full...But it is a little slow at 
doing
&gt; this, so if a person waits until they &quot;feel&quot; thirsty to drink, 
by
&gt; that time we are already somewhat dehydrated. It senses feelings 
of
&gt; hunger the same way. I believe it takes at least ten to fifteen
&gt; minutes to really feel full, so when in doubt just slow down you 
pace
&gt; to let you brain catch up.
&gt; 
&gt; yes, so there are lots of good reasons to chew, chew, chew. funny 

how what
&gt; parents or grandparents said and seemed like just a saying, has a 

basis in
&gt; good health.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers
&gt;
