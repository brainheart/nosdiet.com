&gt; No, you don't, Deb...print my stickers! 

....Hey Diane, I already know you have the sticker thing available, 
but thanks anyway...I know you are very proud of them as you should 
be :) For sure I am going to treat myself to the coffee mug and 
maybe a mouse pad, as I have come into some Hannukah money (hmm 
going on 38 and still getting Hannukah presents? I thought it was 
only for the kiddies) Two things... I don't have a printer, and I 
like slashing :)
The bottom line is, all this has to come from inside for me...The 
scale pissed me off, and I think I might even get frustrated with 
the stickers or stamps, as they are external validation for 
something I want to come from inside.... I want a warm feeling 
inside my heart and I don't get &quot;point amnesia&quot; and I know when I am 

going into denial or fool yourself mode... It shows up in the 
tightness or loosness of my pants! Conversely, when I have a good 
day on habit, I really know it too... I have had 21 good days, but 
LOL, they weren't consecutive! It's coming though, it's more like I 
am little by little, embracing the S's rules piecemeal, and this way 
I don't feel to slammed with restrictions...Sweets have taken a 
major backseat these days, and hey last night I had 3 tall glasses 
of seltzer with lemon when it hit the 8 oclock hour and I decided no 
more eating for the day... Oh but then I had a middle of the night 
eating session, and polished off 1/3 lb of roast beef... Oh well.. 
My point is : I could have had food from 8 until whenever and done 
even more damage... The eating late at night when things are 
upsetting me, is pretty hard to beat, but I will do it... Just next 
time I feel that way, I will do what I did with the seltzer and 
lime... The roast beef made me have nightmares about my first 
horrible creepo boyfriend anyway! So for sure, it wasn't worth it..
It's just such a longstanding habit....I have to focus most of my 
attention on this habit it seems, since I feel it's causing most 
damage....
Also, back to this idea of slashing, or stickers, etc... I really 
want to let NoS infiltrate my life in more of an unconscious way 
anyway... the reward is doing it and feeling good and a healthy 
relationship with my food...

&gt; I'm not usually this ditzy.
&gt; Diane
....Sure you aren't :) LOL
Besides, I like ditzes!
Kidding Diane! We know you are in Mensa :)
Love,
Deb
