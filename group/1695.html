Welcome, Amy.

Fast food is not off limits. You can enjoy it every
once in a while with a clear conscience. But
obviously, if you eat it every meal, no-s isn't going
to work. It's common sense, not magic.

But don't worry about fast food too much in the
beginning. Just make sure to get the literal rules
down. Once you've gone 3 weeks strict you can worry
about how much fast food you're eating. If you're a
fast-foodaholic now, my guess is the literal rules
will have a big impact without additional
intervention.

A while ago I proposed &quot;no supersizes&quot; as an
additional S for people who have trouble with fast
food. And remember that sugar-soda is out.

Best of luck to you and let us know how it goes,

Reinhard

&gt; Hi, I'm Amy. I'm 23 and I live in Alabama. I heard
&gt; about this diet 
&gt; from a friend in my diet group on yahoo. I read the
&gt; No S Diet webpage 
&gt; and had to join up. This seems so easy and
&gt; convienient. I am looking 
&gt; to lose about 20-30 lbs. This will put me at 100-110
&gt; lbs but I'm 
&gt; 4'11&quot; and that is actually in the range of my
&gt; healthy weight. Here is 
&gt; my problem and concern. I am a fastfoodaholic. Now I
&gt; know that fast 
&gt; food should be sparce and eaten in moderation
&gt; anyways, but is it off 
&gt; limits for this diet? I know this is a dumb
&gt; question, but unless I 
&gt; missed it on the web page (which I may have) I didnt
&gt; see fast food 
&gt; mentioned directly as to whether it is off limits. I
&gt; am a newbie to 
&gt; this no s concept so please go easy. I am looking
&gt; forward to meeting 
&gt; you guys.
