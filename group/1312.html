hi lee

I've fallen over a few times this week too.

it went ok till wed after lunch, and then I lost the plot and all the bad,
nasty thoughts came, and I just so wanted to eat ..... which I did that
evening.

luckily, I have a counsellor I see regularly, and thursday is the day I 
see
her. she helped me see that all the reasons why have kept my weight (mostly
protection from the world after an abusive childhood and how that led me 
to
think about the world and people) were fighting to reassert themselves.
seeing her helped me back on an even keel.

like you, I know in my mind and heart that No S is my saviour.

on friday I was attending a conference and promoting flexible learning. 
A
6.45 am start, 2 1/2 hr drive, setting up the stands etc, and then talking
to all these wonderful people and sitting in on the conf. I was going to 
say
dismissively, there wasn't time to eat, but I didn't have morning or
afternoon tea, and had no sugar stuff at lunch, and only one serve. when 
I
got home it wasn't so good. I was tired and my resistance was low.

now I'm enjoying the weekend, and catching up on the emails :)

I think we need to keep returning to the writings of Reinhard, reinforce 
our
understanding, love ourself when we move outside the No S boundaries and
lovingly lead ourselves back to the beautiful and simple answer.

love

jen
