&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the rubber stamp set is a great idea, if only
&gt; I had the foggiest notion how to go about implementing
&gt; it.

.....I will do some research and see if I can clear the fog :)

.. A calendar web site for slashing out/stamping
&gt; days on habit, that I could do. It could be optionally
&gt; public, if you wanted the encouragement of knowing
&gt; other people were monitoring your progress, or
&gt; private, if you're shy. If people are interested in
&gt; this, let me know.

....That seems pretty cool, however I think there must be some 
satisfying thing about the tactile quality of ritualistically taking 
out the &quot;red marker of power&quot; or stamping the living &quot;S&quot; out of 
the 
calendar for real :)
Still, the website is a great idea in the meantime!
By the way, what the heck is going on with Alexa? I would almost 
feel tempted to say, take *that* off your homepage until it actually 
says something other than &quot;be the first to write a review&quot; or, 

alternatively, &quot;review info temporarily unavailable&quot;... I know that 

both Dave Perspicacious and myself both submitted reviews...so where 
are they? Lame...
I have to eat dinner now, it's overdue and I did 3 massages today...
I guess you have to be careful what you wish for, when I said &quot;I 
need structure&quot; on UR, I got instant results :) Certainly can't 
complain... Things have been so slow till today.
Peace,
Deb
