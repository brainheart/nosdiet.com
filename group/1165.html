Hi Cat,


I missed out on the western food, my weight was attributable to over 
generous servings of white rice at home, then with binge drinking 
and eating I really lost control. So at 26, I made the decision to 
become fit and am half the way there.

India is a place of extremes, 60% of this city lives in slums and 
are poor and then there is the 300-million strong middle class, 
which is the target of McDonalds and other food chains. We are just 
starting to see a rise in fat kids fed on fast food, and there are 
quite a few obese adults. Once you move away from the cities, in 
non-urban areas, if one is fat then U must be from the city or else 
a rich person. Oh and yes, many people are dying from starvation 
that's the other extreme.

The Indian fast food contains potatoes, oil, butter but it is 
nothing like the McDonalds food or any other chains. There was a 
big controversy when it was discovered that fries were fried in oil 
with beef fat. Everything is coated with sugar for gloss and 
cheese. Cheesy pizzas with 3000 calories. I feel so guilty when I 
have them but then I have it twice or thrice a year. Some of the 
indians who have been to the US find the food very fattening and if 
they dont watch it, they can just put on weight even if they have 
been healthy adults all their life. But they do admit that American 
food is tasty like hell. Is Homer Simpson the ideal American?

I will share more gory details of my story of losing weight.

Regards,

Ajay L

&gt; do you attribute your weight to westerizing of the food or the 
portions of food available?? is it becoming more common over there 
to have weight problems??
