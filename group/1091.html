Sanjay,

Sorry you didn't get a quicker response, as Allan
mentioned, sometimes it can take a while. There was a
lot of traffic this week and I guess I was a little
overwhelmed.

You were worried about having fluctuated a bit in the
wrong direction. I wouldn't worry about this, if
you've been strict about the rules. Is it possible to
adhere strictly to the system and still overeat? Yes,
but it's harder, and it'll be obvious. There's no
magic here. You lose weight because you eat less.
You'll know whether you are eating less because there
are fewer windows of opportunity for food to get in.
And to quote an old GI Joe cartoon, &quot;knowing is half
the battle.&quot; The other half is the direct, restrictive
effect of these simple rules.

Norma, Mary,

Welcome from Atkins! This diet aims to solve a
different problem than Atkins. Atkins etc. work great
for some people at fast loss, but, as you've
experienced, it's not much good at permanent loss.
Permanent is clearly a more important issue, and it's
really not that hard once you get into the swing of
it, but it requires a very different mindset. I think
a lot of people don't sufficiently appreciate this
difference, that it surprises them and throws them off
(they rejoice/panic with every little fluctuation or
lack thereof at the scale). This is a pity, because if
you can get past the surprise element, this new
mindset makes things much easier. Patient effort over
time = astonishing, permanent results with ultimately
much less effort.

Welcome also Darlene and Chel. Anyone else I missed?

I noticed at least a couple of you are &quot;restarting&quot;
after giving it a brief and not completely successful
try. Better luck this time. Sometimes it takes a false
start or two. You now have a more realistic sense of
the challenges involved know what in particular to
watch out for. Remember a few posts ago I suggested
that newbies give no-s a trial run for a week or so,
assuming you'd fail but just to get the lay of the
land? Even if that wasn't your intention, consider it
that.

Reinhard
