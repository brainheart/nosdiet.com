I see food as a reward sometimes... but I do not go overboard, just a little
endulgance. For instance, I work my ass off at the track 5 nights a week
trying to drop weight, and tone up. If I have a good week of no cheating,
and eating good, I will reward myself with a small piece of cake or
soemthing after a nice healthy meal. This is not a once a week event, more
like once or twice a month, which for me is just enough to satisfy my sweet
craving as well as keep me looking forward to working hard again because 
not
only do I see results but I also know I did not negate my results by having
a small piece of cake or whatever. I am slowly learning to eat healthily
again, and in time we all can. We just need to break the bad habits.

Let me quickly mention my college bad habit... I went to college a solid 
195
pounds. I was fit, in great cardiovascular shape from playing 3 sports 
and
lifting weights all the time... I get to college and start drinking Mountain
Dew by the caseloads, eating out all the time, pigging out in the all you
can eat dining halls, drinking beer (when I turned 21 of course :-) ), 
and
even started smoking (big big mistake!). I found myself graduating at a
whopping 255 pounds. 60 pounds over 4 years is distgusting and I was down 
on
myself for a long time... One day I looked in the mirror and said, slow
steady changes and time will take this weight off. Sure enough, Im losing
about 2 pounds a week and look forward to getting back down to the high 
190s
low 200s. The number one thing that makes losing weight so tough is breaking
the old habits that I have built over the last 15 years or so.

Anyways, sorry to ramble on... anyone who reads this, hang in there, work
hard, stay on the list for support and be patient. Slow and steady wins 
the
race in the end!!

Mike

Subject: Re: [nosdiet] Hi all! I'm new!


&gt; Thank you so much for all the advice. I am going to begin taking dance
classes on September 13th,
&gt; and as of now I'm just excersizing by myself at nights. I don't have 
a
scale in my house, so
&gt; perhaps I'm best off that way!
&gt;
&gt; I think my biggest overeating or overindulging problem is when I have 
a
long, hard day at school
&gt; or work and I feel like I've *EARNED* a mouthful of cookie or chips 
or
whatever. I'm trying to
&gt; get out of that mindset though. Food is not a reward or a comfort after 
a
long day.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; anyone else experience that feeling? Come home, see the apple pie, 
and
think, &quot;Oh, I earned a
&gt; slice today?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; HM
