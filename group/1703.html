Well, Deb, you're leading me down a complicated road that I'm not 
quite prepared to travel. =) I don't find my quote negative at 
all. I think it makes a helpful distinction. My understanding of 
life needs to be much simpler than the things you describe (which 
make my brain hurt). =) 

Hey Diane I know my statement has lead to some subtle 
confusion...Let me clear up what I mean by &quot;negative&quot;.
First off your example is very good and clear, and if it's working 
for you stick with it...What I meant was that a plan which uses 
Willpower to say &quot;No&quot; and only focuses on this as the primary method 

of success is negative, because it focuses on what one *can't do* 
(ie:don't eat this, don't go there, don't do that....) and is 
lacking a positive side (ie: what will I do when I have to make a 
choice? I *will* make a plan, I *will* let myself have half a 
scoop, I *will* choose to walk around the block and avoid that 
Dunkin donuts, etc...) this is what I believe you feel 
is &quot;discipline&quot;, and it is a positive game plan, not just having to 

say &quot;No&quot; and then expect your will to make you a superhuman against 

the forces of Diet Destruction :)
So hope your brain doesn't hurt anymore and that this was a bit more 
lucid :)
Come to think of it, when I learned the acupuncture meridiens and 
the organ systems *MY* brain hurt too, so I was being silly thinking 
that people who don't have any background in this would really be 
able to access the concepts...They are radically different than the 
Structural view of the body common in Western medical study. Sorry 
LOL!
Have a Splendidlyriffic day (ala Ned Flanders)
Love,
Deb
