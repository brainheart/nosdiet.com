I found this today and feel like this is what I have been looking 
for. I started this 6 meal crap with Body for Life and have 
literally blown up more each month. For me I do not this it was the 
6 meals principle, but rather I don't think my concept of small meal 
is the industry's concept of a small meal. I feel like my life is 
centered around eating every three hours. Even with exercising, I 
still could not reduce my weight. NoS makes so much sense and I plan 
on beginning it tomorrow. Not that I am procrastinating, I just want 
to go out tonight and get foods that I like that i can make meals out 
of 3 times a day and have it in the house. I am so excited about 
this because i feel intuitively that this is the answer that i have 
been searching for. I need to get rid of sugar. The snacking is not 
my problem. It is the sugar and seconds. It will be a shock to my 
system to have a plate of food put in front of me and know that that 
is it until the next meal and not have to look at my watch to see 
what time the next meal should be. I will follow the wisdom of 
Reinhard and gradually cut back on portion size. I believe this will 
come naturally in time. For the first time in a long time I feel 
that i am going to lose this mid forty male weight. I'm excited 
about this group and look forward to continued conversations with the 
group members. Wish me luck. I'm going to need all the 
encouragement I can get the first few weeks.

Thanks
APJ
