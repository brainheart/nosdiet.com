Dear Vicki and Lynda

One other source of motivation is the feeling of eating less, before you lose any 
weight. The feeling of lightness in your stomach, a good appetite in the morning, 
better sleep, more energy. I'm getting all this just from putting less food in my 
mouth.

Vicki,
I just joined this group a few days ago. I am already fit (and working 
on
building up my lean musle mass, now). But, I did lose 20 pounds in April.
It took me about 2 months. I'm 37 and am 5' 6&quot; tall and currently 
weigh
124-125. If I can do that after giving birth to 8 babies (7 of them in 
10
years), I think anyone can. I didn't follow any crazy diet. I did all
kinds of research because I wanted to lose weight and stay healthy. I could
talk your ear off about all kinds of things I've learned during my research
and my own weight loss experience. But, I really think this No S plan is
really do-able, simple and healthy. (too bad I didn't think of it myself!)

I had 2 motivators: good ol' vanity and health. I couldn't stand that I
wasn't in shape any more, as I used to be a body builder before I got
married. I wanted to look good again. I knew how to exercise - that comes
easy for me. I had never needed to lose weight before, so that I had to
learn.

I have a beautiful 4-year-old special needs daughter who can't sit, walk,
talk or crawl. She is also fed through a G-tube in her stomach. Her wheel
chair is big, bulky and not exactly light. I have to be able to be in shape
to lift that chair in and out of the van. I need to be able to lift my
daughter and carry her without tiring. I never give up hope that Micayla
will be able to over come her physical challenges. However, I need to be
prepared in case I am still lifting her and helping her the rest of my 
days.

I also want to avoid as many illnesses and diseases that many people start
accumulating in their 40's or so.

So, these are MY motivators. You need to find what motivates YOU. Why do
YOU want to lose weight? Keep those in mind when you are making your food
selections and exercise decisions (to do it or not to). When I wanted to
leap off my treadmill and land on the bed and sleep instead of keep on
going, I would just keep saying &quot;I want to wear my little black jeans!&quot; 
over
and over. You need to find something to focus on when you get into a tough
situation.

To fight tempation, go through and throw out all the REALLY bad junkie 
junk
foods. Fill your cupboards with things that will lead you to achieving 
your
goals. On your S days, go buy a single serving of what ever you are
treating yourself to so there are not left overs to torture yourself with
the next day. I don't really like very many sweets, but put a cheesecake 
in
my house and I will eat it all for sure in about a week. We all have
something that we cave to if we are not careful. So, be careful and keep
the stuff that tempts you the most out of your house.

I so agree with Reinhard's advice about keeping oatmeal around for a quick
something to eat. I eat that just about every morning for breakfast with
whatever fruit is in season and some skim milk. But, I will eat it for 
any
meal or snack if I'm hungry and don't feel like actually cutting up and
cooking vegetables and whatever else. (No, I am NOT a vegetarian)

I wish you the best. I know you CAN lose the weight. Be grateful you don't
really have THAT much to lose. The holidays are coming and will be here
before we know it. Get yourself ready now and you can show up to all those
parties you will be invited to looking STUNNING!!!

Lynda
who talked your ear off anyway.... LOL!!!

Thanks for letting me join your group. I'm 46, 5'7&quot; tall and weigh
165 lbs as of this morning. I'm hoping to get down to under 150 lbs.
Can use lots of support as my motivation isn't the strongest at times.
Thanks, Vicki
