Maria,
Good to have you aboard. Don't be so freaked out about actual weight you lose. 
Genetics, age, sex, and so many other factors in who loses how much can really get 
you depressed if you aren't doing as well as you think someone else is.
You may not be designed to be a size 6, I know I'm not. Have fun, exercise, listen to 
your body, and don't let the scales determine how you feel about yourself.

Hello
I accidently found the no s diet website and found it very 
interesting. I talked to my mom about it and she and I decided to 
try it. My downfall is chocolate and I figured this diet will help 
me. I have been trying the weightwatchers diet on my own with some 
success but I am tired of counting all the &quot;points&quot; all the time. I 

probably sounded dumb when I would comment outloud how many points I 
was eating. 

I just wanted to ask from you guys if you could tell me how many 
weeks you have been on this diet and how many pounds you have lost? 
Thank You,

Maria
