I started doing google adwords for the nosdiet site at
the beginning of last month. June was the first full
month. 

Gory details available as always at:

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/lumberjack.html">http://www.nosdiet.com/lumberjack.html</a>

The good news is that we just about doubled the number
of *cumulative* 'ok' hits to the site last month. That
is, of everyone to visit the nosdiet web site since
inception about a year ago, almost half did it last
month. Most months we get about 90 'ok' hits. This
month we got over 800 -- just a little shy of that
'order of magnitude' so beloved of computer
programmers.

It took some tweaking to get reasonable clickthrough
rates and numbers, but adwords is very intelligently
set up and that was easy --too easy, I spend untold
hours messing around with it. The problem is my ad
(the diet itself) violated google's editorial policies
(reapeated 'no's) and they disabled it. The single no
(&quot;no snacks, sweets, seconds&quot;) watered down version
that I was forced to adopt, besides compromising my
creative integrity, didn't get nearly the same kind of
clickthrough. So here at the end of the month I'm sort
of stuck. There's also been increasing competition for
the &quot;no carbs&quot; keyword, which was used to be easy
pickings. &quot;gluttony&quot; is still going strong, however. 

The idea is not to do this forever but to kindle a
fire and the step back and let it spread (five cents a
click seems cheap until you've accumulated a thousand
of them) . Despite this month's successes, that
doesn't quite seem to have happened yet, so keep your
ideas for keywords and ads coming.
