Hey Valerie, figured I might as well put my two cents in, too. :)

Sounds like you have a lot going on... perhaps it would help you to
take on one or two things at a time instead of everything, if at all
possible. You could start with whichever problem seems to be the
worst. Or alternatively, pick the problem you think you can solve the
easiest, and then use any boost in self-confidence as momentum.

You mention drinking... if you are an alchoholic, I'd say this is by
far the worst problem, and you would do well to get into a support
group and concentrate on taking care of that first.

For the others, I read somewhere that smoking a pack a day is about as
bad for your health as being 50 lbs overweight. If you are more
overweight than that, your best bang-for-the-buck would probably be to
concentrate on getting your diet and weight under control first. As
others have said, a lot of people gain weight when trying to quit
smoking, so that's yet another reason to make sure your diet is under
control.

As for no-S, for me it took a lot of time (probably more than most on
this group), and it took me a while to see results. But if finally
did happen, I've lost about 15 lbs in a 9-month period. No, nothing
like those fad diet commercials where people lose 200 lbs in a week,
but this is slow, steady progress, and that makes it easier to keep
off for good. So if you give it time, it does work!

Good luck. :)

&gt; Well...
&gt; 
&gt; All these reports of success are good for me to hear. I have been on a 

&gt; serious binge since Friday. My life is like that carnival game
where you 
&gt; have a big rubber hammer and about five holes that have heads
popping out of 
&gt; them. As soon as you bash one head back into its hole, another head
pops 
&gt; out of another hole. Eventually you are frantically whirling this
way and 
&gt; that, bashing heads all over the place, yet you can't keep them all
down...
&gt; 
&gt; My life resembles that game in more ways than one -- with the
problems that 
&gt; keep popping up everywhere, and the addictions that keep popping up.
They 
&gt; call it changing seats on the titanic when you give up one addiction
and 
&gt; pick up another. I find that when I cut back on my drinking and
smoking, I 
&gt; pick up on my eating. When my eating is disciplined, my drinking and 

&gt; smoking increase.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I know that's not the focus of this forum, so I'll move on.
I guess 
&gt; what I really want to say is that I've felt miserable ever since I
got off 
&gt; track with No S, and I want to get back on track and NOT keep going
on/off, 
&gt; on/off. That's the defeating the whole purpose of this being a
lifestyle 
&gt; change and not a 'diet'. Though I guess if it's a lifestyle change,
it's 
&gt; not something you can go on and off of.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know. I'm pretty confused at this point. What I DO know is
that I 
&gt; liked the way I felt after three weeks of No S, and I decidedly
DON'T like 
&gt; the way I feel now. My M/O is to usually keep going down the path
of self 
&gt; destruction until I can't take it anymore. But before it gets that
bad, I'd 
&gt; like to nip it in the bud and start over. The problem is, I don't
think I 
&gt; can...
