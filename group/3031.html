Heya guys,

How weird--and possibly lame, though I'm not complaining by any means
:-)--is it that just setting the no-sweets rule is making me stick to
it. I'm starting to think that it's not so much a question of will
power for me, but my &quot;why not&quot; attitude toward food. Before, I 
would
usually shrug and ok everything, but having the rule gives me a good
automatic response--that's &quot;no, thanks&quot;--to go to instead of me 
going
through the stage where I consider if I want the sweet because the
answer's always going to be &quot;sure, why not.&quot; So, yay! It's working 
out
really well for me.

Not following the other s's is working out well too, since I've been
doing basic weight training (squats, push-ups, sit-ups) and I want to
make sure I have enough protein and nutrients. The cool thing about
no-sweets is that I eat around the rule. I've been eating a lot more
veggies than I have before, and eating the protein helps me not feel
hungry. I've actually wondered if I'm eating enough of the proper
foods, but that's probably just paranoia; volume-wise, I have plenty
since I'm eating such bulky and low-glycemic foods. The extra fiber's
been, erm, uncomfortable on my digestive system, heh, so I'm hanging
in there until I adjust. Btw, Deb, you inspired me to have peanut
butter on my bananas, and they were delish! (They were too ripe to put
honey on, and I don't have cocoa powder.) Thanks for the suggestion!
Peanut butter has been my mainstay for the past few weeks, and it
looks like cottage cheese might be my next phase. I'm feeling a dairy
urge. Anyone have any tips for cottage cheese? :-)

Have a great day!

mayo
