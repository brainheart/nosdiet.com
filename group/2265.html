Debbie -- weighing on two different scales is going to give you 2 very different 
results -- good for you for realizing that. As for slashing off a month -- I am 
ready!!! Today is day 3 -- I changed my calendar to December, but put red slashes 
through the 2 empty squares that would have been yesterday and Monday. I want to see 
the entire month with red slashes!!!

&gt; Well it was my monthly weigh in.....

So when Lee wrote she weighed in I decided to (oh my God weighing is 
definitely a harmful addiction!) use my mothers scale! LOL!
I figured it's December, start fresh, then measure with the 
tapemeasure... I wasn't expecting a loss, but also wasn't expecting 
much of a gain, if anything, possibly one or two pounds...The damn 
thing said I had gained like 9 lbs! LOL...
Well this time I said &quot;there's no way in hell that F&amp;78-beep'in 

thing is right!!! I completely dismissed it as a faulty crappy 
scale, even crappier than my now &quot;killed&quot; one one my wall! LOL
So when I checked with my tapemeasure it showed that I am indeed, 
the same... I was wrong before guys, because I actually messed up 
somehow, but I have not lost 3 inches, I lost two... My sons math 
skills have not seeped into my brain yet, so I wasn't able to 
subtract 2 from 40! LOL!!!
Anyway.. I am holding that 2 inch loss, like it's my lifeline, and 
as of now, I re-state my hatred of bathroom scales....They suck big 
time and should be against the law...Just think what kind of 
emotional roller coaster I would have been on, if I felt that the 
readout this morning was actually credible? It would 
have &quot;F*&amp;bee'ed&quot; me up so bad, but I am still smiling thanks to my 

tapemeasure!
Measuring rules, and scales are for fools (sorry guys had to think 
of a good rhyme, you aren't fools, but scales don't rule!)
Love, 
Deb
A &quot;Recovering Fool&quot; 
Boy, am I, SOOOOO looking forward to slashing out a whole month! :)
Who's with me? :)
I am on a mission!!!!!
