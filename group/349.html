Good night--I didn't check this board for month and, well, I've been 
swamped trying to catch up! I've skipped a several weeks at a time 
before and get a few messages behind, but wow--traffic has really 
picked up around here. That's awesome! It's so encouraging to hear 
how everyone is doing. (but goodness, killing/eating lumberjacks? --
actually that really helped me understand!) 

I've been not so diligent recently (like since October...eek) so, I'm 
back at it again!! I noticed results Aug-Oct when I was more faithful 
so I know it's possible, and that I'll be pleased and feel better. I 
manage not to snack much at all, and am trying not to go overboard on 
my S-days. I'm really struggling with breakfast, though. I don't have 
a kitchen (in a dorm room) and don't have time to run to the 
cafeteria before class... so I end up eating a pack of peanut-butter-
on-toasty-crackers and a bottle of water sometime before lunch. That 
doesn't count as breakfast, does it? Any suggestions for something 
that is quick, portable, and doesn't require cooking? (Yes, people 
like me are the reason the pop-tart industry flourishes)

As an aside, over break I was with my family, several of whom are 
doing Atkins. They're losing weight, of course, and I'm not going to 
sit around and argue with them. I'm glad to see them happy. BUT, at 
every meal--*EVERY* meal!--they talked about the diet. And if one ate 
a bite of pancake or potato--well, &quot;I'm splurging this time, it's no 

big deal.&quot; I don't think I like hearing people justify their food 

choices. Just eat what you want (within guidelines, duh), for 
goodness sake, and enjoy it! This is why I love the no-S. I never 
even have to tell people I'm dieting--I can just politely refuse 
dessert because I'm full.

It's good to be back on the no-S!
