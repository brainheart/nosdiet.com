Shannon,



I have the same question so I hope to hear an answer too. By the way, I 
too
am new to the No S Diet. Started Monday. Perhaps we can keep track of each
other. I am looking to lose a lot more than you. My goal is to drop 60
pounds.

Hello Group!

I would like to say Hi and tell a little about myself. Been dieting 
for years and always looking for something new! This sounds like 
something I can live with. I'm looking to lose about 15 pounds and 
keeping it off.

So today was the first day of the noSdiet. I think I made it through 
pretty well. Here is a question. On the S days, can I snack and 
have sweets and eat my normal meals. Or do I just have the sweet 
with the meals? I'm not really a seconds person so I don't have much 
worry about that, but those two other evils (snacks and sweet) are 
something I'm going to look forward to. Those of you that went 
through your first S day did you just go out of control? Or when you 
finially got there was it just no big deal? I'm sure the second week 
wont be so crazy, but I'm sure worried about the first one. 

Thanks for the help. And I'm looking forward to read all your posts.
