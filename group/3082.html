&gt; HI Nathan, 

Lets see, two grapefruit juiced is what maybe 1 cup of juice add 1 
juiced orange and you have maybe another 4 oz. so that would be a 
glass of juice, kashi cereal is good ( as long as its not a mixer 
bowl full :) and a piece of toast, sounds like a perfect breakfast. 
listen to your body, if while eating you feel full before you have 
eaten everything just stop.and fix less next time. if the worse you 
do is drink too much natural juice you are doing just fine then..and 
on another note, if eating this amount gets you to lunch without 
delving into the snacks then you are eating the right amount of 
great food for you! 
Personally, i prefer to eat my fruits and veges and not drink them. 
though my 14yo is a juicer, she lost near 20# on NOS.

Good luck

Julie 
&gt; I was wondering if anyone else on the list is a fresh fruit / 
vegetable juicer? 
&gt; 
&gt; If so, I was wondering if you count the ingredients of your juice 

as part of the &quot;plate&quot; you're allowed, per meal. 
&gt; 
&gt; For example, this morning I juiced two grapefuits and an orange, 
and drank this along side my bowl of Kashi cereal w/ soy milk and a 
piece of 20-whole grain toast w/ butter. Does that sound like more 
than a plate of food? 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess that doesn't seem like a lot of food if you're having a 3-
egg omelette, six pieces of bacon, toast, and coffee, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; Not that there's anything wrong with that! (if I may 
misappropriate a quote from Seinfeld &lt;wink&gt;)
