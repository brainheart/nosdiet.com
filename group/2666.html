&gt; Good for you cece. Its amazing how we see our lifelong habits 
changing and you've only fallen once since last thursday? pat on the 
back for you !!The greatest thing about this diet is that each day 
you start anew,&amp; only three rules and you can break them on S days 

sometimes. It is truly one day at a time as we break our addictions 
to sugar, snacking and seconds helpings. Maybe only one is your 
problem, not all of us have all three as our demons.I thinks its so 
easy as there is only one food group to avoid &quot; sugar&quot;. the others 

are self control issues. Also Cece, it is quite helpful to not have 
those snacks and sweets available to eat in the home, at least in 
the beginning.Not sure of your family dynamics, so i know that could 
be hard, But I say if your family loves you they will do what is 
best for the good of each member. So stay strong and good luck, Julie
&gt; 
&gt; I've only been doing this program since last Thurs. and my eating 

has 
&gt; gotten so much better. I just had one binge which was last 
night. I 
&gt; binged on sweets and some cheese crackers. Today I did fine. I'm 
&gt; not even getting that hungry between meals. I recommended this 
&gt; program to a friend as well.
&gt; 
&gt; CeCe
