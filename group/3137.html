Welcome, Betty. Hope your first day went well.

I'm not sure I have anything to add to Deb's advice.
She's right that even addressing one of the problems
you mention (pop, finishing your son's meals) could
have a big impact. Being overweight is a big problem,
but it usually has obvious, correctable causes that
people perform all kind of mental gymnastics to blind
themselves to (with plenty of help from diet gurus).
It's great that you've taken off the blinkers and seen
them for what they are. That's a big first step.

The first few weeks might be tough. It might take a
few failed attempts. And even if you are successful in
strictly following the rules from the get go, progress
won't be like lightning. Don't be discouraged. Once
you get in the habit, it's not only easy, but a
pleasure. So what if it's a little slow? Your problem
of overeating will be fixed at the source. You'll be
thin because you'll have the habits of a thin person.
It's a solution built to last for decades. With that
in mind, a few weeks or months of struggle in the
beginning is a blip.

I don't mean to scare you. Some people (like me) find
it easy from day one. You might be one of those lucky
ones. But many others have a tougher time. So mentally
budget for that possibility. Being at home with the
fridge is definitely extra hard. Keep your meals
sufficiently large so that you aren't tempted to pay
it unscheduled visits. And bug us at the first sign of
trouble.

Reinhard
