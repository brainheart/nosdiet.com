&gt; Hi David, The problem is all the diets are talking this talk
&gt; now. Every candy bar now claims to be a healthy part
&gt; of a &quot;low carb lifestyle.&quot; They scorched earthed the
&gt; term &quot;diet&quot; and are now moving on to the next one. 

Hi David, congratulations on your 3 inches off that is like almost 2 
pants sizes! I don't think that the name should change simply for 
this reason...When I was looking for a way to get back into healthy 
eating I actually had a different &quot;Diet&quot; reccommended to me...I was 

curious about it so I went on Google and Lo and Behold there popped 
up No S Diet...If it wasn't for the name, and that search engine 
stuff, I wouldn't have had the great fortune to find this terrific 
plan for a good food &quot;lifestyle&quot;...There are so many commercialized 

buzz words and people are oh, so polarized in these dieting versus 
lifestyle &quot;camps&quot;
The bottom line is you should just have the quiet satisfaction that 
this is working for you...Did you ever consider that these people 
are just jealous of you on some level? I hate to say it, but there 
are definitely some people who, unwittingly, have a hard time being 
around someone elses success, and then say some kind of negative 
thing cloaked in the guise of &quot;friendly advise&quot;
It is *your* lifestyle and you are showing yourself and those guys 
that you are a disciplined person...That is great! We salute you :)
I think that once people read this sites code of eating ethics, so 
to speak, it is very obvious that this is infact not a trendy yo yo 
diet, but for the uninitiated, I think the title will save a handful 
of people out there in the sea of commericialized confusion.
Keep it up and don't feel the need to even make yourself vulnerable 
to negativity...Think of those Nay sayers as a &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot;
Good Luck!
Debbie
&quot;The Thirteenth Disciple&quot; :)
PS...No S discipline?...Sounds like a bondage site! LOL
