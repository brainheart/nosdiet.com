Hi Risa,

I'm sorry to hear about your joint problem. As far as
exercise goes, I don't know how to begin to advise
you.

It seems to me the psychology of emotional eating goes
something like this: &quot;Food is a reward. It's the
simplest, most basic kind of reward. The good kid gets
the cookie. So now I'm stressed and depressed. I feel
lousy about myself. But if I give myself a reward,
then I must have done something good, right? If I give
myself the effect, then maybe the cause will follow.&quot; 

This is irrational, of course, but you can see how
your subconscious might be wired to believe this.
What's the trick to getting around it? I don't think
mere conscious awareness will do it for most people
(though it's a start). I think you need a replacement
reward. If you can walk or exercise, that's best. If
not, a healthy or harmless food/drink reward seems
like the best alternative. I think you're on track
with the carrot and lemon water. It may take some
experimenting to come up with just the right reward
for you.

I would strongly consider 3 vs. 2 meals. I think two
meals is overly ambitious and perhaps not even a good
in itself. Giving yourself the full 3 means no &quot;well
I've only had 2&quot; excuses for emotional eating. It
might nip it in the bud, before it becomes a problem. 

Less isn't necessarily better. Consider the following
quote from that Harvard article I linked to regarding
the Amish:

&quot;The French explanation for why Americans are so big
is simple,&quot; said Jody Adams, chef/partner of Rialto, a
restaurant in Harvard Square, speaking at the Oldways
conference. &quot;We eat lots of sugar, and we eat between
meals. In France, no one gets so fat as to sue the
restaurant!&quot; Indeed, the national response to our glut
of comestibles is apparently to eat only one meal a
day—all day long. We eat everywhere and at all times:
at work, at play, and in transit. &quot;Japanese cars—the
ones sold in Japan—don't have drink holders,&quot; New York
Times health columnist Jane Brody said at the Oldways
conference. &quot;The Japanese don't eat and drink in their
cars.&quot;

Best of luck, and keep bugging us if you're having
trouble,

Reinhard

&gt; um
&gt; *embarrassed face*
&gt; actually, walking is part of the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; i've been trying to get steady exercise but i have a
&gt; serious structural problem with most of my joints -
&gt; hips being the worst. therefore, any kind of
&gt; physical activity can cause shooting pains (meaning
&gt; i don't know when or where or how it'll happen, but
&gt; when it does happen it's bad), and if the intensity
&gt; of the shooting pains is high enough it causes a
&gt; corresponding intense emotional trigger that can
&gt; last for hours, subsequently causing grinding of
&gt; teeth yadda yadda. the joint problem/pain is its
&gt; own thing i've been going to multiple drs and
&gt; allopaths for several years now to fix; it's the
&gt; emotional response i'm trying to damp down, since
&gt; that lasts so much longer than the pain does. 
&gt; physical therapy exercises aren't too intensive, so
&gt; i need *something* to help. 
&gt; 
&gt; i've been trying the carrots option offered here -
&gt; it helps a little. i'm also trying to drink a lot
&gt; more water. i sometimes put lime or lemon juice in
&gt; it. i'm also buying mass amt's of pickles, since
&gt; they have a minimal calorie load. debating going to
&gt; three meals, at 12:45 / 6 / random needed pm time
&gt; instead of my original 12:30 / 8:30 plan.
&gt; 
&gt; still working on it - was sort of hoping someone had
&gt; a better idea than i'd had ;)

&gt; &gt;Emotional eating (eating because you're stressed or
&gt; &gt;depressed) is a little like emotional marksmanship
&gt; --
&gt; &gt;not a good idea. Try this instead: emotional
&gt; exercise.
&gt; &gt;Nothing fancy, necessarily, just a little walk will
&gt; &gt;do. Doesn't have to be a safari, around the block a
&gt; &gt;few times is sufficient. Don't groan and ignore me
&gt; &gt;just yet. Consider:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1) how the eating just makes you more depressed and
&gt; &gt;stressed (and fat).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2) how a little walk does the opposite. And this
&gt; isn't
&gt; &gt;the only benefit: you have leisure to *think* about
&gt; &gt;whatever is stressing or depressing you. Because
&gt; &gt;walking irrationally makes you happy (both because
&gt; of
&gt; &gt;the sense that you are moving towards a destination
&gt; &gt;and because of the endorphins or whatever) you are
&gt; &gt;more likely to find a solution or pep yourself up
&gt; than
&gt; &gt;you would be with mere stationary thinking.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Don't plead lack of time. Just get yourself out of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;house. As for how long your walk should be, make
&gt; that
&gt; &gt;decision once your feet are in motion. You're in no
&gt; &gt;condition to think properly, even about as little a
&gt; &gt;thing as this, cooped up inside next to the
&gt; &gt;refrigerator.
