Most of us have probably read the book, right?

Years ago a fellow dieter in my office burst out laughing while reading it, because 
the following passage reminded her so much of our faulty little cycle of thinking 
about eating. I've been meaning to find and share it for a long time, so here it 
is:

-------------
The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it 
plunged the little prince into deep dejection. 

&quot;What are you doing there?&quot; he said to the tippler, whom he found settled 
down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full 
bottles. 

&quot;I am drinking,&quot; replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air. 


&quot;Why are you drinking?&quot; demanded the little prince. 

&quot;So that I may forget,&quot; replied the tippler. 

&quot;Forget what?&quot; inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him. 


&quot;Forget that I am ashamed,&quot; the tippler confessed, hanging his head. 


&quot;Ashamed of what?&quot; insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him. 


&quot;Ashamed of drinking!&quot; The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut 
himself up in an impregnable silence. 

And the little prince went away, puzzled. 

&quot;The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,&quot; he said to himself, as he 
continued on his journey. 
-------------

I've been reminded of this many times and it has helped me see--sometimes in time to 
avoid one--the ridiculous traps we (I) fall into. If you find no application, that's 
okay. If you do find one, I don't need to explain it to you!
