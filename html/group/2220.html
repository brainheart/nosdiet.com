Hi guys :) Well, here's an interesting article which is actually 
diet realated, to check out if you are curious :)
I have always believed in the interplay between eating and 
depression.
I often would crave certain foods, and go up and down mentally, or 
vice versa.... I felt with certainty that the food I wanted was 
going to provide me with something that was lacking... This is 
really true... After all, neurotransmitters in the brain, don't just 
come out of thin air. They need raw sources as the building blocks, 
ie: food.... So much has been said about serontonin and the brain, 
and I have been experimenting with some suppliments to help my 
chronic depression issues... However I have noticed that sometimes 
those cravings have a tendency to backfire on me in the end (eg: I 
wind up feeling really awful the next day, or I gain weight, and 
then feel awful also... you get the picture)
This article is pretty easy to understand, and the part I am 
suggesting you guys read, is the section which starts on the topic 
of Tryptophan &quot;natures prozac&quot;.... In the past, Hana has mentioned 

that vitamin B is usually involved in some sugar craving during 
pms... well this explains the mechanisms behind that as well, and 
suggests that the amino acid tryptophan is crucial to serontonin in 
the blood chemistry, and therefore in the brain chemistry...but it 
is one of the least abundant of the amino acids we normally derive 
from our diets.... I am planning on adding 5-HTP to my dietary 
suppliments, and probably vitamin b complex as well... I will let 
you know how this affects my eating and my depression... Consider me 
your humble guinea pig :)
So for those of you who are chemistry buffs, enjoy this article and 
please feel free to share your own experiences or info on the 
topic :) Oh, by the way, to return to a somewhat &quot;taboo&quot; topic here 

on noS (remember Godwin),,, pay attention to the short paragraph 
which mentions the role of phenalalynine (aka, &quot;Nutrasweet&quot;) and you 

can draw your own conclusions as to how it affects mood and 
appetite, in relation to the other important brain chemistry 
nutrients involved in these complex interactions :)
Peace and Love,
Have a great day all!
Debbie :)
Heres the link. Hope it works :)
