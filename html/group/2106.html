Dear Deb,
Seems to me that exercise builds more muscle that probably weighs more
than fat...but sure look better than fat. Two people can be the same height
and height, but the one who exercises will look better in their clothes....
that is what it appears when I look at those &quot;I lost 100 pounds .....look 
at
me now&quot; in the magazines, some ladies still look pudgy and others...maybe
even weighing more than even me -a size or two smaller! I have not lost 
any
thing so far this week, but had bought a pair of a size smaller pajamas, 
and
my DH said those are cut nice and look nice on you....I know it is not
cause they
just fit, but because I lost a lot of Marshmellow fluff in the middle,
with the few pounds I recently have Slashed off, plus we walk. I hurt myself
at Curves and remember what you told me about that outfit-they are not
getting any of my money! It was a free trial, after two weeks my arm and
shoulder finally repaired, so I can lift my hand weights and the weather 
has
been mild so far here in Michigan.
We have the treadmill and bike all set up downstairs in wait for our usual Big 
Freeze. My neice and her family are coming for Thanksgiving. She has recently lost 15 
lbs on Weigh Watchers, so we are all in diet mode around here this year.Love, 
Bonnie
