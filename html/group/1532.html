hi darlene makes sense doesnt it its how i ate as a child and i was not over 
weight
we had no snacks and we had no sugar my mother would say wait til your dinner we 
could not raid the refrigerator or drink juice or milk between meals water only and i 
never had a weight problem til i left home and i ate A LOT at meals as a child .. 
meat potatos veggies etc.. occasionally we had ice cream cone on weekends as a 
special treat 
so now i have to not buy my kids snack food or sugar either then if its not in the 
house its not tempting me either.. 
another great part is that eating is such as social activity and always being on a 
diet i could never participate
now i can eat what everyone else is having and not be a pain in the butt
i try to eat low carb when i am on my own but when i cant at least i can still stay 
on plan by following NO S rules 
make sure you eat well at your meals so you are not hungry in between and drink lots 
of water if you are nursing :) you should burn a great deal of calories doing that

Subject: [nosdiet] Greetings, all!


Hi, I just stumbled across the No S Diet website a few days ago, and 
am giving it a go. I'm a lifelong diet drop-out, with a lot of 
weight to lose (about 75 pounds). I'm also a nursing mom to a 7 1/2 
month old son, and I'm not down to my pre-pregnancy weight yet (which 
was much too high). I've been stuck at the same weight (7 pounds 
over pre-pregnancy weight) since 6 weeks post-partum, and can't stick 
to a diet. But when I read the description of the No S Diet, it just 
made sense. After all, this is how Europeans eat, and most of them 
are slim. So I'm jumping in! I'd love to read some success stories 
to keep me motivated. Have you lost weight eating this way? What 
sage advice can you give?

Darlene
