Hi, my name is Thom, I am 45 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
I heard about this diet from a friend of mine. I believe I have tried
nearly every diet known to man over the years. I even had RNY bypass
surgery back in 2001. At my worst, I weighed 400+ pounds. After surgery 
I
lost 155 pounds. I have since regained 15 pounds. My biggest problem is
snacking. I do snack on sweets, so I guess I struggle with two of the S's.
Since I've had bypass surgery, seconds is not a problem. I typically, do
have seconds or thirds, but that's because I always take really small
portions. I don't know how much I will tolerate at any given time.
Sometimes, I can only eat half a burger and a few fries. Other times I 
can
eat a full burger, fries and a salad. Never can I eat more than the normal
person would consider a full plate.



I do have a problem with overly sweet, overly greasy or high carb foods.
That is a result of the surgery. It is a by product that helps you lose
weight. 



My goal is to lose another 60 pounds. I've been walking about a mile a 
day.
I am struggling with the no snacking rule. Having said that, it is easier 
to
deal wit when I know it's only for a few days and then I get a break.





Enough ramblings, that's my story thanks for listening.
