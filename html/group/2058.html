I joined the group because I gained 15 lbs last year over the 
holidays and gained another 15 in the process of trying

Fast since last April but finally have given up on it this weekend. 
...Welcome Carrie!
It's funny, I used to be on Herbalife, a &quot;meal replacement&quot; system...
I did great in the short term, but those pounds came flying back on 
once I was done with eating 2 shakes a day...That gets really old, 
especially if it's not a hot day. And to be completely honest, I 
didn't lose weight because of the shakes, it was because of the Ma 
Huang suppliments that were supposed to (and did!) control appetite.
Unfortunately they also are implicated in stroke and heart attack, 
so I decided to try and go it with out them...Being a stay at home 
mom has challenges all of it's own. It's very stressful, even 
though it's worth it. I was fully domesticated during my sons 
formative years, and single....Good luck in your new challenges. If 
you really stick with NoS it will be good to you. And if that means 
not plopping on another 15 pounds during the Winter months, then 
that is pretty great. Being an aerobics instructor, I'm sure you 
don't need any advice on the exercise front :)
Good Luck again and let us know how it goes for you!
Peace,
Debbie
