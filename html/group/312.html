&gt; 
&gt; If you're serious
&gt; &gt; about building up your abs, you shouldn't be doing
&gt; &gt; crunches, anyway... they're useless. 
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; Come on, *useless* ????? I would have never thought
&gt; it 
&gt; went that far. What I had been doing is a set of 10
&gt; different ab 
&gt; exercises, on the floor, including crunches, leg
&gt; lifts, pull knees to 
&gt; the chest, bicycles, touch toes, etc. Are you saying
&gt; ALL of these are 
&gt; useless for building abs? Are all of these replaced
&gt; by the relatively 
&gt; simple shovelglove exercises, and in fact is
&gt; shovelglove even more 
&gt; effective? 

I don't know anything about this except that I can't
stand writhing around on the floor and that
shovelglove alone does do the trick for me. I'm not
sure if it would satisfy the demands of a professional
bodybuilder, but I imagine very few people in this
group fall into that category. While I'm sure he was
exaggerating *a little* in this case, Dan does know a
lot about exercise...

&gt; Yes, I know that his diet wasn't perfect, but
&gt; techcically he could 
&gt; have said he was following nosdiet, skipping weekly
&gt; s-days. My main 
&gt; reason for bringing this up is to show proof that
&gt; calorie restriction 
&gt; works, to the tune of 245# in a year's time, and the
&gt; fact that he 
&gt; kept it simple and only had 3 &quot;windows&quot; of
&gt; opportunity a day helped 
&gt; him achieve something unbelievable. And now, he is a
&gt; national icon, 
&gt; married, and probably making pretty good money just
&gt; from being 
&gt; accidentally famous. 
&gt; 
&gt; As far as skinny fat, you have to cut the guy some
&gt; slack. After all, 
&gt; he *did* go from over 400lbs to about 190. He's not
&gt; gonna look like 
&gt; the calvin klein underwear model.
&gt; 

I don't think Dan was trying to knock Jared. What the
guy accomplished is pretty amazing, and there are
enough similarities between what he did and the
nosdiet for us to take heart --thank you for pointing
this out. I think Dan was just emphasizing elements of
the nosdiet that are different from what Jared did
(more variety) and might make his basic approach more
reproducable for non-Jareds.
