&gt;Hi Bonnie, This is grat, i am a banana lover, and usually have one 

every day. Some of this I knew already from being a nurse, but 
others were new to me and make so much sense.Bananas &quot;the perfect 

food&quot;. Thanks for sharing, have a great week, Julie 
&gt; 
&gt; BANANAS This is of interest-for any banana lovers like 
me.....Bonnie
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; After Reading THIS, you'll NEVER look at a banana in the same way 

again!
&gt; 
&gt; Bananas. Containing three natural sugars - sucrose, fructose and 
glucose
&gt; combined with fiber, a banana gives an instant, sustained and
&gt; substantial boost of energy. Research has proven that just two
&gt; bananas provide enough energy for a strenuous 90-minute workout.
&gt; No wonder the banana is the number one fruit with the world's 
leading
&gt; athletes.
&gt; 
&gt; But energy isn't the only way a banana can help us keep fit. It can
&gt; also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses and
&gt; conditions, making it a must to add to our daily diet.
&gt; 
&gt; Depression: According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND amongst
&gt; people suffering from depression, many felt much better after 
eating
&gt; a banana. This is because bananas contain tryptophan, a type of 
protein
&gt; that the body converts into serotonin, known to make you relax,
&gt; improve your mood and generally make you feel happier.
&gt; 
&gt; PMS: Forget the pills -- eat a banana. The vitamin B6 it contains
&gt; regulates blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood.
&gt; 
&gt; Anemia: High in iron, bananas can stimulate the production of 
hemoglobin
&gt; in the blood and so helps in cases of anemia.
&gt; 
&gt; Blood Pressure: This unique tropical fruit is extremely high in
&gt; potassium yet low in salt, making it the perfect way to beat blood
&gt; pressure. So much so, the US Food and Drug Administration has just
&gt; allowed the banana industry to make official claims for the fruit's
&gt; ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure and stroke.
&gt; 
&gt; Brain Power: 200 students at a Twickenham (Middlesex) school were
&gt; helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at 
breakfast,
&gt; break, and lunch in a bid to boost their brain power. Research has 

shown
&gt; that the potassium-packed fruit can assist learning by making 
pupils more
&gt; alert.
&gt; 
&gt; Constipation: High in fiber, including bananas in the diet can help
&gt; restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem 
without
&gt; resorting to laxatives.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hangovers: One of the quickest ways of curing a hangover is to 
make a
&gt; banana milkshake, sweetened with honey. The banana calms the 
stomach
&gt; and, with the help of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar
&gt; levels, while the milk soothes and re-hydrates your system.
&gt; 
&gt; Heartburn: Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body, so 
if you
&gt; suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana for soothing relief.
&gt; 
&gt; Morning Sickness: Snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep 

blood
&gt; sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness.
&gt; 
&gt; Mosquito bites: Before reaching for the insect bite cream, try 
rubbing
&gt; the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. Many people 
find
&gt; it amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation.
&gt; 
&gt; Nerves: Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the nervous 

system.
&gt; 
&gt; Overweight and at work? Studies at the Institute of Psychology in 

Austria
&gt; found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like 
chocolate
&gt; and crisps. Looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found 

the
&gt; most obese were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. The report
&gt; concluded that, to avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to
&gt; control our blood sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate 
foods
&gt; every two hours to keep levels steady.
&gt; 
&gt; Ulcers: The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal
&gt; disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness. It is the 
only raw
&gt; fruit
&gt; that can be eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases. It 
also
&gt; neutralizes
&gt; over-acidity and reduces irritation by coating the lining of the 
stomach.
&gt; 
&gt; Temperature control: Many other cultures see bananas as a &quot;cooling&quot;
&gt; fruit that can lower both the physical and emotional temperature of
&gt; expectant mothers. In Thailand, for example, pregnant women eat 
bananas
&gt; to ensure their baby is born with a cool! temperature.
&gt; 
&gt; Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Bananas can help SAD sufferers
&gt; because they contain the natural mood enhancer tryptophan.
&gt; 
&gt; Smoking: Bananas can also help people trying to give up smoking. 
The B6,
&gt; B12 they contain, as well as the potassium and magnesium found in 

them,
&gt; help the body recover from the effects of nicotine withdrawal.
&gt; 
&gt; Stress: Potassium is a vital mineral, which helps normalize the
&gt; heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body's 
water
&gt; balance. When we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby 
reducing
&gt; our potassium levels. These can be rebalanced with the help of a
&gt; high-potassium banana snack.
&gt; 
&gt; Strokes: According to research in &quot;The New England Journal of 

Medicine,&quot;
&gt; eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the risk of death 

by
&gt; strokes by as much as 40%!
&gt; 
&gt; So, a banana really is a natural remedy for many ills. When you 
compare
&gt; it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the 
carbohydrates,
&gt; three times
&gt; the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice the 
other
&gt; vitamins
&gt; and minerals. It is also rich in potassium and is one of the best 

value
&gt; foods around.
&gt; So maybe its time to change that well-known phrase so that we 
say, &quot;A
&gt; banana a day keeps
&gt; the doctor away!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; PASS IT ON TO YOUR FRIENDS
