Sounds like Richard will be a great accountant some day... you ought
to get him to do your taxes come April. :-)

&gt; &gt; Wow Deb! How old is Richard? I'm lucky to be able to do simple 

&gt; addition in my head . 
&gt; 
&gt; ....Yes I can relate Carrie :) I am mentally deficient in this area 

&gt; and it stresses me out just to have to do those simple equations... 

&gt; He, on the other hand, has an innate love of numbers. He is 
&gt; fascinated with them... The bigger the number the better... When he 

&gt; was around 5 years old, and at that time we had no tv connection so 

&gt; once in a while we watched videos, but there was plenty of time for 

&gt; pursuing other things like reading and more creative stuff, I found 

&gt; him lying on the floor in his room, with a notebook in which he was 

&gt; creating columns and columns of math equations... I asked him what 

&gt; he was doing and he told me that he was creating a &quot;multiplication 

&gt; table for the number 5&quot;. It started at 1x5 and went up to around 

&gt; 500! I noticed this interest in &quot;ordering&quot; things and numbers, when 

&gt; he was very young... At one year old he had more fun playing with 

&gt; his blocks by placing them in a line on the floor from one end of 

&gt; the room to the other, and placing the blocks in size ascending 
&gt; order... Another cute thing I noticed was, even when he would read 

&gt; a book, the excitement, for him, came from &quot;accumulating&quot; chapters 

&gt; read... He was reading Harry Potter by kindergarten, again during 

&gt; the tv free time, and he would come from his room to report on how 

&gt; far he had gotten in the book... every hour he'd say &quot;I'm on page 

&gt; 78&quot; then &quot;I'm on page 100&quot; etc.... It was the numbers that gave 
him 
&gt; the thrill... Last thing, I'll mention in this long non-diet post, 

&gt; oh did I mention I like food?, is, one time he came over to me with 

&gt; the large Yellow pages and told me with excitement in his voice, 
&gt; that &quot;hey mom, this book has over 1000 pages!&quot; Clearly it wasn't 

&gt; the content of the &quot;book&quot; but just the amount of pages that 

&gt; interested him.... I think he wants to be an astrophysicist when he 

&gt; grows up... I wouldn't doubt it if he does do that.. Where else can 

&gt; you use &quot;astronomical&quot; numbers on a regular basis... He loves it, 

&gt; and I don't know where he got it from, but it's great!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here's a good quote I saw today, wanted to share it with you all. 

&gt; Have a great day guys!
&gt; &gt; Carrie :)
&gt; &quot;You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you 

&gt; don't try.&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; ....It figures. Those operas always end with someone meeting their 

&gt; doom! :) LOL
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb :)
