Wow, thanks for all the responses guys! True, sometimes I tend to 
get a bit impatient (hehe). Anyway, as for the warrior diet question 
and why I like the philosophy:

Basically, a few reasons 

1. The ultimate aim is to limit total daily caloric intake to 1 
sitting. And for someone like me, who can be &quot;good&quot; all day if he 

knows a good dinner is on the way, that is a godsend.

2. I live at home with my family, and coming home, a good Indian 
dinner is always ready (and is pretty nutritious) so I don't have to 
worry bout constantly eating the wrong kind of food on this diet.

3. I enjoyed feeling light on my feet and not having an excuse to be 
lazy (the approach of mealtime sometimes tends to do that to me) 
throughout the day since I work at an Investment Bank.

HOWEVER, there are a few reasons why I chose the NoSdiet instead:

1. I am not what you call a consistent person in much of anything. I 
have the all or nothing mentality. Thankfully, up until now, 
the &quot;all&quot; phases in my life have balanced the &quot;nothing&quot; phases in 
my 
life in terms of fitness and gotten me to 170 lbs. But I know I could 
have already reached my goals if I had not been so extreme. The 
warrior diet, I fear, might just enhance my extreme nature towards 
diet and I don't want that. I want to be able to adhere to a plan 
centered on moderation with some rules, like the NoSdiet. Then, when 
I am ready, mebbe I can switch to the Warrior diet. 

2. I fear the physiological effects of the WD. I think that people 
who are overweight are more sensitive to storing extra calories 
ingested in one meal as fat then slim people. To that end, I think 
the WD would be better as a maintenance type of diet once you reach 
the weight you want.



Reinhard,

The main problem I have with &quot;maybe&quot; overeating is that in my case, 

it's not so obvious. The problem is mostly centered around dinner. 
That is where the &quot;no seconds&quot; part is harder for me. The type of 

food I eat is vegetarian and not too fatty, so the calories are less. 
The problem is that I can't not have seconds unless I absolutely cram 
my plate with food the first time! However, it's slowly getting 
easier to guage how much I need so that the next day, I am not 
starving but not stuffed either. I am also working out daily so that 
tempers this problem a bit until I get a handle on it.
