Hi Deborah,

My experience has been the S days get less extreme
because the habits you build on non S days carry you
through. The bar for what your unconscious considers
excess gets lowered. Don't get discouraged if the
first few weekends are a little excessive. It's to be
expected.

I also make sure that I treat myself to something
genuinely delicious on S days. I like this funny
danish style pasty called a &quot;copenhagen, &quot; for
instance. I spend some time thinking about what my S
is going to be, and I really enjoy it. It's a
deliberate process. I don't just wait for hunger to
overwhelm me unprepared. Eating well (in the
gastronomic sense) really can translate into eating
less. Just look at the French.

What about damage control, if things have started to
go out of control? I know it sounds counterintuitive,
but go out and get yourself something really nice to
eat. Not something that is merely at hand and is going
to make you disgusted with yourself for ever having
wanted it. Go outside and get your personal equivalent
of my &quot;copenhagen.&quot; I suspect you'll enjoy it, feel
better about yourself, and leave the carpet in peace.

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; This is basically a cry for help. I am eating
&gt; everything in sight. Something vile has been
&gt; unleashed inside me. Even the carpet is looking
&gt; tasty. Has anyone else had this experience on an S
&gt; day? How to tame the beast?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
