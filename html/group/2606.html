Hi Beth,

&gt; I actually heard of NoS on a t-tapp web site
&gt; (exercise site that I 
&gt; love) 

I've been getting a lot of hits from this site.
Welcome other t-tappers lurking about.

&gt;please tell me this truly will work for me if I
follow &gt;the 3 main NoS principles... my 
&gt;head is trying to sabotage me already by telling me
&gt; it could not be this simple and that instead of 
&gt;losing weight I am
&gt; going to just gain even more weight. 

It will work -- if you stick to it. That part's a
given. There's no magic here: you'll eat less and lose
weight. The question is whether you'll stick with it.
The nosdiet is not especially onerous, but sticking
with it is not a given. It takes work, for some more
than others. The good news is that it's work invested
in habit, which pays interest. You work for habit so
that habit will work for you.

&gt; Hello, my name is Michael. I just discovered the
&gt; nosdiet today, and, since it's a Saturday, 
&gt; I'm starting today. I even went to Lowe's and
&gt; bought a sledgehammer.
&gt; 
&gt; That's all; more later.

Double welcome. Looking forward to hearing more from
you in the shovelglove group, too.

Hi Nancy,

&gt;I have one major weakness--I'm a
&gt; chocoholic. It's my drug
&gt; of choice for calming frazzled nerves

Try to swap out something less offensive for this.
Tea, coffee? And tell your chocoholic soul that if it
can just hold out till the weekend, it will be richly
satisfied (think of an especially nice reward in
advance as incentive).

&gt;
&gt; this is my official announcement that as
&gt; of right now I'm
&gt; a No-S dieter. Please say a little prayer that I can
&gt; make it through
&gt; tomorrow without cracking!

Prayer said. Keep us posted as to it's efficacy!

Best to you all,

Reinhard
