That's great Cat... I can't say the same for myself...Actually 
weighing myself wasn't on my mind at all for the last week or two, 
but all the talk about scales and weighing finally, in an ironic 
twist, got into my brain and I, not only weighed myself when I knew 
I would be up in weight (due to pms bloating, and eating some salty 
food to boot) I WEIGHED MYSELF AT NIGHT! LOL! How crazy is that?!
Then I weighed myself this morning again to compare to the night 
time weigh in...
This is what I found...
Before the bloating started, I was down somewhere between 5 and 6 
lbs.
I don't trust my scale for a real accurate number.
Last night when I succumbed to the morbid curiosity I have been 
preaching against (lol!) the scale said that I was 5 lbs up!
Then this morning the scale said I was only 2 lbs up.....
I tried desperately to maintain my rational mind after last 
nights &quot;psychological experiment&quot;, knowing full well in my rational 

mind that my evening weight is usually 2 lbs more than my morning 
weight... Then when I saw that I was only up 2lbs this morning I was 
very relieved! This small gain is a direct result of the water 
retention (sometimes if I have really salty food the week before, I 
can retain 4 lbs of water in my body...thats 64 ounces folks!)
So those 2 lbs will come off by next week, for sure, and that pretty 
much means I am around the same as the end of las month... I'm fine 
now, but,I won't lie about my initial feeling, no matter how much 
the &quot;scales were tilted&quot; against my success and my rational mind was 

standing on the sidelines saying &quot;what the hell are you doing now 

Debbie?&quot;
I felt worried that I blew everything... This wasn't the loudest 
voice in my head at the time, but it impacted my mood for a short, 
but potent window of time.... I think watching that crazy weight 
challenge show, and having so many posts about scales, were the 
reasons for my curiosity...So Jocee, you see, curiosity did kill 
the &quot;cat&quot; (pun intended, LOL) :)
I'm not stepping on that damn thing again for at least a month.
It is a self torture machine!
Today I will put it in a faraway place in the cold dark damp 
basement.
I'm sticking with the slash and measure approach. It is so much more 
humanitarian :)
Love,
Deb &quot;taking a dose of her own medicine&quot; Feder
