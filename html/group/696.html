&gt; You may want to check on that fish thing. They have had reports here 

&gt; recently about the mercury in fish and how it is not good for you. 
So
&gt; there are certain kinds you need to watch how much you eat of.

The latest mercury issues was with Farmed Salmon (what you usually get
in the store). Farmed atlantic salmon in particular had high levels of
mercury.

Most ocean fish has some mercury in them. You should be able to get a
listing of safe ammounts to eat from your Government. 

&gt; I have also heard that peanut butter is good for you specially for 

&gt; woman. Im going to try to start incorporating it in my meals. And I 

&gt; think the s diet said no snacks unless it is a piece of fruit. 

One of the nice things about the diet being up online is that you can
go and check:

========================================
What do you mean by &quot;snacks?&quot;

Snacks are &quot;when,&quot; not &quot;what.&quot; Pretzels with lunch is 
lunch.

What about healthy snacks?

Eat healthy meals. If you know you have just three, you'll make them
count. I'm perfectly aware that an orange between meals is not going
kill you, that, taken in itself, it's perfectly healthy. But the idea
is to have the orange instead of, not in addition to, and in
justification of, some unhealthy part of your meal. The problem is
primarily one of self-discipline, and if you start making all kinds of
exceptions, you'll fail.
==========================================

Reinhard, have you ever thought of adding in Anchors to each section
so they can be pointed to directly?
