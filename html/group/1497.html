Hi Valerie,

I've come up with little systems for some of the other
problems you mentioned, though I'm not sure they're
No-s caliber:

<a href="http://everydaysystems.com/group/6">http://everydaysystems.com/group/6</a>

As for not thinking you can, take it a day at a time.
Every day you stick with it you build habits, you
*can* more. 

We're rooting for you. Bug us incessantly with
updates. Whatever happens, I promise you, we're not
going to get tired of hearing about it.

Reinhard

&gt; Well...
&gt; 
&gt; All these reports of success are good for me to
&gt; hear. I have been on a 
&gt; serious binge since Friday. My life is like that
&gt; carnival game where you 
&gt; have a big rubber hammer and about five holes that
&gt; have heads popping out of 
&gt; them. As soon as you bash one head back into its
&gt; hole, another head pops 
&gt; out of another hole. Eventually you are frantically
&gt; whirling this way and 
&gt; that, bashing heads all over the place, yet you
&gt; can't keep them all down...
&gt; 
&gt; My life resembles that game in more ways than one --
&gt; with the problems that 
&gt; keep popping up everywhere, and the addictions that
&gt; keep popping up. They 
&gt; call it changing seats on the titanic when you give
&gt; up one addiction and 
&gt; pick up another. I find that when I cut back on my
&gt; drinking and smoking, I 
&gt; pick up on my eating. When my eating is
&gt; disciplined, my drinking and 
&gt; smoking increase.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I know that's not the focus of this forum,
&gt; so I'll move on. I guess 
&gt; what I really want to say is that I've felt
&gt; miserable ever since I got off 
&gt; track with No S, and I want to get back on track and
&gt; NOT keep going on/off, 
&gt; on/off. That's the defeating the whole purpose of
&gt; this being a lifestyle 
&gt; change and not a 'diet'. Though I guess if it's a
&gt; lifestyle change, it's 
&gt; not something you can go on and off of.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know. I'm pretty confused at this point. 
&gt; What I DO know is that I 
&gt; liked the way I felt after three weeks of No S, and
&gt; I decidedly DON'T like 
&gt; the way I feel now. My M/O is to usually keep going
&gt; down the path of self 
&gt; destruction until I can't take it anymore. But
&gt; before it gets that bad, I'd 
&gt; like to nip it in the bud and start over. The
&gt; problem is, I don't think I 
&gt; can...
&gt; 
&gt; Valerie
