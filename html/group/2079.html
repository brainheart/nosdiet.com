Hi Julie,
=20
Boy I can relate to coming home depressed after trying on clothes, it can 
b=
e one of the worst experiences sometimes. Good job not drowning your sorro=
ws in ice cream, don't know that i'd be that strong. :) As far as the exer=
cise being hard, I know how that goes too, when I first started teaching 
ae=
robics, I had knee problems. Makes it very hard to get motivated to exerci=
se. Was wondering if you'd ever tried pilates. They are often used in phy=
sical therapy and if you have an gentle routine, it might work well for 
you=
. I've got a dvd I love called Pilates Complete For Weight Loss by Bodywis=
donmedia. Its got routines for beginning, intermediate and and advanced 
pl=
us you can choose the length of the workout from 10 minutes up to 30 minute=
s. Anywho...I&quot;m done rambling now lol. :) :) Take care!
=20
Carrie :)

&gt; .....Whoever Murphy was, he is on my S*@#t list...LOL
&gt; I appreciate your response Jools, I hope your big baby didn't kill=20

&gt; Boy he's only 8, I can't wait until he's 18!
&gt;=20
&gt; Well i weighed in at Publix and about fell off the scale in=20
&gt; shock, i had no idea i weighed that much and it was quite=20
depressing=20

&gt; ....Sorry about that one :(
&gt; Remember, you were wearing shoes and clothes, and who the heck=20
knows=20
&gt; how good the &quot;Publix&quot; scale is? If you must weigh yourself, do 
it=20
at=20
&gt; home, so it can be as consistant as possible, and do it when you=20
&gt; wake up...Weigh your peaches at the supermarket, not yourself :)
&gt; Have a good day oh eternal rocker!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

bowl of ice cream. Fixed a margarita and vegged for the next 2=20
