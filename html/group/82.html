Tammy, 

I'm a personal trainer (www.danmcvicker.com) and so my
diet is a bit different from the No-S. I'm on this
list because I like to reccomend the No-S diet because
it's easy to remember, simple, and it works. 

The main thing is to prep what you can before-hand. I
always have a lot of frozen vegetables in my freezer
because they're really good for you (yeah, your
grandmother and mom were right) and you can pop them
in the microwave and have something to eat in 10
minutes. I like to use a George Forman grill because
they're quick as well. When I am cooking chicken or
whatever, I might as well make a few extra and throw
them in some tupperware. Then, that's an easy &quot;on the
road&quot; kind of food. 

Other things I like for meals on the run are those
tuna packets that rip off (all you need is a fork)
with some premade veggies--you can buy carrot sticks
and pre-cut broccoli at the grocery store--get some
ranch to dip them in, and that's a nice little meal.
Make sure to eat them outside or in a ventilated
area--otherwise the tuna smell is somewhat strong.
Another good thing is beef jerky, actually. High in
protein, low in fat and carbs, it's a great thing to
have on hand. Again, the key to all of this is KNOWING
that you're going to be hungry, and planning ahead,
instead of just letting whatever happens, happen.
Because what's going to happen is McDonalds. 

I DON'T like protein bars, because too many of them
are just like candy with some protein thrown in.
That's not the point, obviously--No-S means no sweets,
and protein bars are definitely sweets. If one of the
first three ingredients are sugar, high fructose corn
syrup, or fructose, it's terrible for you. Watch out
for &quot;Organic Foods&quot; that use things like &quot;all natural
brown rice syrup&quot; and things like that--they're secret
code for &quot;sugar&quot;. And just because it's &quot;organic&quot;
doesn't mean that it's good for you.

If you're still curious about what I eat, this is it.

I usually work out first thing in the morning,
followed by (something like):
8 am whey protein shake with dextrose and maltodextrin
(yes, this breaks my &quot;no sugar rule&quot; but there's a
reason for it. And it's too complicated to get into
here.)
10 am egg whites and one yolk scrambled with
vegetables and a bowl of oatmeal (not instant), mixed
berries
1 pm Chicken breasts, vegetables, nuts
5 pm steak with large spinach salad, oil and vinegar
dressing
8 pm tuna and flax-seed oil
10 pm cottage cheese 

My breakdowns are as follows:
Calories: 2800, Protein: 280g Carbs: Less than 100g,
Fat: 150g

This is a fat loss diet, but only for me, I'm 220 lbs,
about 15% bodyfat, male and quite active. And down
from a high of 270 lbs and about 33% bodyfat this
January. 

Obviously, this breaks the &quot;No Snacks&quot; rule, but
everything is very tightly controlled, so it's not the
same thing as out of control snacking. If you're going
to just set up your diet without tracking the calories
and macronutrients, then I HIGHLY reccomend just doing
as the No-S diet does and eating only three
meals--it's too easy to overeat on six or seven. 

I hope this helps. Remeber, there's no need to
overcomplicate. Be prepared, exercise, follow the No-S
rules, and you will lose weight.

&gt; &gt; I dont know if anyone else is like this but if my
&gt; &gt; days are not 
&gt; &gt; (normal) I eat bad. I need to have some things
&gt; ready
&gt; &gt; because after 
&gt; &gt; you make lunch ready for 6 kids the last thing you
&gt; &gt; want to do is cook.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Tammy
&gt; 
&gt; I keep grilled chicken breasts and some vegetables
&gt; ready to throw in the microwave and heat up. That
&gt; usually does it. The small amount of time it takes
&gt; to
&gt; prepare a bunch of these (I usually make 5-6 at a
&gt; time) is easier than having to make them at the
&gt; time.
