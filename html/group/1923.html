well one difference now may be that sugar is in the form of high fructose
corn syrup which hits the system much faster plus all the food additives 

perhaps when you were a child things were less refined .. there is nothing
in sugar that is good for us .. its empty calories

I don't really need to jump into this thread but I couldn't resist. I just 

wanted to say that I don't think sugar affects ALL kids--and it must not 

affects all adults the same way either. In our houseful of little kids I 

don't remember ever noting that they got hyper after eating sweets. They 

would rarely be allowed to eat a lot of sugar at one time, but surely there 

must have been a few incidents...? My parents weren't very strict about 

such things and sometimes the kiddoes would spend their own money on candy 

and go overboard with it. I, too, was a kid for many years (LOL) and I 

don't remember ever getting wound up by sugar. Wound up, yes, generally by 

the influence of other kids--but I don't recall a connection to sugar. As 

an adult, I have never noticed increased energy from sugar, or caffeine 

either, for that matter. I really don't know what a sugar &quot;high&quot; or 
&quot;rush&quot; 
feels like. If I'm really nodding off, drinking coffee will wake me up, 
but

that's all.

I was at a babysitting job recently (with other adults) where we discussed 

this, and I think we concluded that there must be variations from child to 

child (and adult). But anyway, I guess the non-reactive people are in the 

minority, so all caution is warranted!

Just a ramble,
Diane

&gt;I used to work for a pediatrician and he was forever saying that it didnt 

&gt;really affect kids. I told him he was so wrong, he just didnt give his 
kids

&gt;any sugar.When we owned the ice cream shop it didnt take long for the 
sugar

&gt;to kick in on the kids and we would have to scrape them off the ceiling 
and

&gt;walls (them and the ice ceam )LOL
