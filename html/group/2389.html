Hi ev eryone!

My name is Heidi, and I just started the Nosdiet yesterday. (Great idea, starting on 
a Friday, huh?) I would like to lose about 20 more pounds and keep it off, and this 
looks like a safe, healthy, and reasonable way to start. 

I was doing Weight Watchers Flexpoints after my last child was born, and I lost 20 
pounds... After one hectic weekend, I fell off the system and stopped counting 
points. I fully intended to get back on, but first decided to eat all those things I 
had been &quot;denied&quot; while on Weight Watchers. A couple of months and several 
pints of ice cream later, I've gained back 5 of the pounds I lost. I have no desire 
to start counting points again- I have 3 young children and barely have time to keep 
up with laundry, much less journaling every bite I eat.

The Nosdiet makes a lot of sense to me. My biggest problems are SWEETS and SNACKS, by 
far. I don't doubt that I'm a &quot;carb addict,&quot; but the Atkin's-type diets 
just don't seem healthy to me. I was using my Weight Watchers points for snacks and 
sweets, and I was shorting myself on healthy foods at meals. Not a good plan for the 
long-term. (Or even the short term, ha ha).

I think I can do this, and stick to it. I'm not being denied my favorite meals, or my 
favorite snacks &amp; sweets, as long as I follow the rules. Yes, I think this is a 
good diet for me.

Thanks,

Heidi
