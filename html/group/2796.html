If your journeys are really short, have you thought of a bike? It would
fulfil several purposes, costs nothing on fuel,good for your weight
loss,contribute to the USA's reduction in Carbon dioxide emissions and 
a
consequent slow down in global warming.Set an example to others on saving
the planet

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well guys, last week I had several days where I was off plan and
&gt; snacking out of pure stress... I'm over that hump now and yesterday
&gt; I weighed myself for the first time in about 2 weeks... I was up
&gt; only 2 lbs... On the surface this may seem &quot;bad&quot; to some of you, 
but
&gt; I consider it, actually, a triumph... No I haven't totally lost my
&gt; mind (not yet! lol ) I say it is a triumph for three reasons:
&gt; 1. My binge could have lasted for many weeks and even months as it
&gt; did last Winter/Spring/Summer.... and it ended within days of it
&gt; starting.
&gt; 2. On any given day in the past of really really overeating, like 
at
&gt; a smorgasboard or a party, I could, with total predictability gained
&gt; 5 lbs in one or two days, and give me a week, it would be more like
&gt; 7! So 2 is fairly innocuous in comparison to the old gaining
&gt; patterns...
&gt; 3. I am not giving up and getting discouraged further... I gave
&gt; myself a reality check, and now I have some info re:
&gt; actions/consequences....
&gt;
&gt; Seriously, a binge in the past would have dwarfed this weeks stress
&gt; eating, so I am really proud that even &quot;bad&quot; eating behavior 
is
&gt; changing now... The damage was minor but it wasn't by chance. I
&gt; know in my heart, that NoS was impacting me in a good way, even when
&gt; I felt out of control... It was *less* out of control.
&gt; So please people, cross your fingers toes and eyes for me since I
&gt; will be trying to create my own &quot;part time&quot; job this week, 
working
&gt; at a local womens gym doing chair massage... This will be a good
&gt; thing for me even if I can only make a few dollars each day at it
&gt; because 1. I'll be out and about 2. She lets me use her facility and
&gt; it's fun.. One of those 30 minute aerobic circut workout places with
&gt; upbeat music, where I will be able to move my bootie more than I
&gt; have been lately. 3. Hopefully, if I stick it out and go there on 
a
&gt; regular basis, not negotiable depeding on my laziness or mood, I
&gt; will get my name and face known in the community and hopefully this
&gt; will translate into more private clients at my office... She's
&gt; letting me set up shop without asking for a cut, and I don't have 
to
&gt; travel far (with my 18 year old, unispected Toyota which leaks
&gt; everything! LOL) and pay for lots of gas....
&gt; Nevertheless, it's not a steady paycheck so I am still a little
&gt; worried, as it's a gamble...Usually though, if people see a massage
&gt; chair, they try it out, and if I go there religiously on specific
&gt; days, she believes that with consistency on my part, people will
&gt; start coming since they know I'm there. This makes good sense to me.
&gt; I will of course be praying my &quot;pray-er&quot; off a lot :)
&gt; Please, send me your good vibes folks, I would so much rather do
&gt; what I was trained to do, than some menial clerical job...
&gt; I'll update you on my weight some other time when things change :)
&gt; Hope you are all eating delicious Ssses and having a fun weekend so
&gt; far! :)
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
