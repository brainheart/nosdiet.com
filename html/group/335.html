I first wanted to say that I really enjoy the the intense humor of 
our dear beautiful idiot! I also love that he is straight and to the 
point! I love it when someone is direct with me and not dace around 
issues that are starring you in the face like a huge pink elephant 
that noone wants to acknowlege! Good for you hon! I am one of those 
that are a slave to the fat gene. I also have a thyroid disease, two 
actually. I also was not always overweight though. It is possible to 
have the gene thing and the tyroid crap and NOT be fat, or at least 
obese. Now I also have eatting disorders in my past that i'm trying 
to overcome. I was bulimic and quite recently had a relaps (AGIAN) 
when I realized that I had allowed myself to gain too much and 
comenced freaking out! So as I sit &quot;surfing&quot; and sulking I serch for 

the words &quot;no diet diet&quot; and happen upon this nosdiet thing. I click 

and read eatting my freshly popped popcorn at 10:00 pm. I keep 
saying to myself, &quot; This man is either crazy or serious!&quot; I have 

come to the conclusion he is both and just may be right! Alright 
right! I'll give this a whirl! Hey if anything it beats leaving my 
children motherless and my husband without a wife because I could 
stop throwing up long enough to get my head out of my butt and on 
straight! I'll keep you aprized of my progress and pitfalls!
Saleta
