Hi, Deb!

Yep yep, I love lavash bread, particularly wrapped around an omelette
with plain yogurt. I was on this fun yogurt kick for a while, where I
tried it with everything. It was good in wraps and as a substitute for
sour cream, particularly in layered dips, and not so good in tea,
blech.

Thanks a bunch for the links. I actually surfed onto nosdiet through
stumptuous. :) However, the other site with pics was really
helpful--woah, do I not want to be 100lbs, I want way more muscle than
that. Heh, I only mentioned Britney because she's short and kind of
buff. (Like I want to be! except for the short part. and without
breast implants and a fake tan.) There aren't a lot of celebrities
with very visible muscles; they tend to be sleeker, and I think I want
to be a little stronger (bulkier) than that. Hmm, Jennifer Gardner
might be a good example, or Lucy Lawless. Still, for the record, I'm
in my mid-twenties. My goal is to be fit sometime in my thirties, so
I'm working my way lazily toward that goal. I do *not* want to have to
come on hardcore after having been told by my doctor that I have high
blood pressure or something worse, after having made myself unfit for
years and years before. I *hate* make-over diets, because they imply
that you've hit your goal, and now you're done. Better to begin as
you're going to continue, I say. Uh-oh, I'm going into rant mode, must
stop. :) Still, I expect to fail about a million little times, and I
expect to fail after I reach my goal, too.

As for shovel glove, I'll see, once I can do the exercises easily
without the aid of a sledgehammer. (my poor spaghetti muscles)

cheers,

mayo
