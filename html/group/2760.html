The frustrating thing about the male system is that it sheds weight faster
than the female, probably because of greater lean muscle mass, but thy
always lose faster.Lowering carbohydrates is at last doing it for me, and
keeping my blood sugars as they should be.I do need to eat a between meal
sometimes though.I had as rasher of well grilled bacon for breakfast and
went into the city today.around noon, I felt dreadful and went for a coffee,
skinny latte with artificial sweetener. I then popped into the
chemist(pharmacy) and bought an Atkins bar,because I couldn't find anything
else that suited my require ments. I was given a gorgeous belt for Christmas
and I have moved up a hole since then, about an inch and it's not tight. 
I
could go 2 if I wanted to have it tight.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thank you Tom - and everyone!! Tom, you made me laugh!! See, it's 
not
&gt; so bad afterall - my need for cream lol!! My dad makes iced coffee
&gt; with whipping cream - gosh it's good! :c) And a small glass will be
&gt; fine for me!
&gt; I use Splenda - a product of my many diet trials.... Splenda is much
&gt; more wonderful to me than sugar now lol...
&gt; Thank you all for the help so far....
&gt; If I could handle it, I'd rather go on my husband's diet of not
&gt; eating all day long until dinner... He's lost so so much weight so
&gt; fast... I'm sure it's not healthy. And I could never ever do it... 
so
&gt; lets hope this one works a bit fast for me!! :c(

&gt; &gt; Hello;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've been doing nos a little over a year. I drank a big cup of
&gt; coffee every morning - it got
&gt; &gt; into a habit. I see no problem with it - it's just a big cup. 
I
&gt; don't put sugar in it and don't
&gt; &gt; believe in lowfat milk, whole milk, or half and half. I believe 
in
&gt; doing it right - I use only
&gt; &gt; heavy whipping cream. Anything else is water.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unless somehow you increase your coffee and cream drinking to 
where
&gt; it equals the
&gt; &gt; calories you cut by nos-ing, don't worry about it. Keep the coffee
&gt; at the level it was last
&gt; &gt; week and do the rest of the diet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, don't expect 3 lbs a week. My advice, don't expect anything.
&gt; Just do it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't drink much coffee anymore just for the simple fact I 
got
&gt; tired of it. Now I drink
&gt; &gt; black tea. With heavy whipping cream.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't sweat it. Good luck.
&gt; &gt;
