On my one short visit to the USA I found the plates and portions to be 
so
big, my mother and I shared meals. It's getting that way in Britain now 
too.

&gt; I've found that social eating, the bane of most other
&gt; diets, is the best way of ensuring portion control on
&gt; this one. You only get one plate, so to pack it away,
&gt; that plate has to be pretty big. The funny looks and
&gt; comments you'll get if you pile it high are more
&gt; effective than any special plate.
&gt;
&gt; I don't mean to knock the advice Hana gives (which is
&gt; very sensible), just to point out another,
&gt; complementary way of approaching the problem.

&gt; &gt; Portion size seems to be a useful key. I saw
&gt; &gt; something on a TV programme
&gt; &gt; once, which showed a plate with a design inside the
&gt; &gt; central part and another
&gt; &gt; on the rim.The idea was &quot;you may cover the central
&gt; &gt; pattern with food, but
&gt; &gt; not the rim.&quot; I personally have plain white plates,
&gt; &gt; but keep my portions of
&gt; &gt; everything except steamed veggies to the centre of
&gt; &gt; the plate and it's
&gt; &gt; working for me.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for all the responses guys! True,
&gt; &gt; sometimes I tend to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get a bit impatient (hehe). Anyway, as for the
&gt; &gt; warrior diet question
&gt; &gt; &gt; and why I like the philosophy:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, a few reasons
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. The ultimate aim is to limit total daily
&gt; &gt; caloric intake to 1
&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting. And for someone like me, who can be
&gt; &gt; &quot;good&quot; all day if he
&gt; &gt; &gt; knows a good dinner is on the way, that is a
&gt; &gt; godsend.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. I live at home with my family, and coming home,
&gt; &gt; a good Indian
&gt; &gt; &gt; dinner is always ready (and is pretty nutritious)
&gt; &gt; so I don't have to
&gt; &gt; &gt; worry bout constantly eating the wrong kind of
&gt; &gt; food on this diet.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. I enjoyed feeling light on my feet and not
&gt; &gt; having an excuse to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; lazy (the approach of mealtime sometimes tends to
&gt; &gt; do that to me)
&gt; &gt; &gt; throughout the day since I work at an Investment
&gt; &gt; Bank.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; HOWEVER, there are a few reasons why I chose the
&gt; &gt; NoSdiet instead:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. I am not what you call a consistent person in
&gt; &gt; much of anything. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have the all or nothing mentality. Thankfully, up
&gt; &gt; until now,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;all&quot; phases in my life have balanced the
&gt; &gt; &quot;nothing&quot; phases in my
&gt; &gt; &gt; life in terms of fitness and gotten me to 170 lbs.
&gt; &gt; But I know I could
&gt; &gt; &gt; have already reached my goals if I had not been so
&gt; &gt; extreme. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior diet, I fear, might just enhance my
&gt; &gt; extreme nature towards
&gt; &gt; &gt; diet and I don't want that. I want to be able to
&gt; &gt; adhere to a plan
&gt; &gt; &gt; centered on moderation with some rules, like the
&gt; &gt; NoSdiet. Then, when
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am ready, mebbe I can switch to the Warrior
&gt; &gt; diet.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. I fear the physiological effects of the WD. I
&gt; &gt; think that people
&gt; &gt; &gt; who are overweight are more sensitive to storing
&gt; &gt; extra calories
&gt; &gt; &gt; ingested in one meal as fat then slim people. To
&gt; &gt; that end, I think
&gt; &gt; &gt; the WD would be better as a maintenance type of
&gt; &gt; diet once you reach
&gt; &gt; &gt; the weight you want.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Reinhard,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The main problem I have with &quot;maybe&quot; overeating 
is
&gt; &gt; that in my case,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's not so obvious. The problem is mostly
&gt; &gt; centered around dinner.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is where the &quot;no seconds&quot; part is harder 
for
&gt; &gt; me. The type of
&gt; &gt; &gt; food I eat is vegetarian and not too fatty, so the
&gt; &gt; calories are less.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is that I can't not have seconds
&gt; &gt; unless I absolutely cram
&gt; &gt; &gt; my plate with food the first time! However, it's
&gt; &gt; slowly getting
&gt; &gt; &gt; easier to guage how much I need so that the next
&gt; &gt; day, I am not
&gt; &gt; &gt; starving but not stuffed either. I am also working
&gt; &gt; out daily so that
&gt; &gt; &gt; tempers this problem a bit until I get a handle on
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
