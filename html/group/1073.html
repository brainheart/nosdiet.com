&gt; I had Women's Essentials Golden Brown Sugar Oatmeal today. Is that 

&gt; considered an &quot;S&quot;. Sure hope I didn't screw up my first day on the 

&gt; plan already!!!

There's a three-part answer to this two-part question. :-)

First, as to whether or not something is considered an &quot;S&quot;, there's
a bit on the webpage which seems minor when you first read it but
really turns out to be the key to getting started on the whole thing:

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#fence">http://www.nosdiet.com/#fence</a>

What is important for the first while -- for me this was about two
weeks, for some people it might be faster, for most I suspect it's a bit
longer -- is that you train your brain on your new approach to eating.
That is the goal right now, to start making the rules second nature;
it'll also start you on your way to the end goal of sustainable 
weight-loss, but right now you have to concentrate on your brain. 
If you wonder if something is OK, then right now it probably isn't.

With that in mind, read over 

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#lists">http://www.nosdiet.com/#lists</a>

That's part two of the answer. Note that that doesn't contradict the
first point. :-)

The third point is possibly the most important of them all:

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#screwup">http://www.nosdiet.com/#screwup</a>

The proper approach to screwing up is to avoid it, not to worry about
it. I think about this part as sunk costs. If you've already spent
$100 on something, still owe another $20, and then realize you could've
got it done for $80, then the best deal for you right then is still the
one you have, because it only costs you another $20 and the other option
costs you another $80. The $100 is sunk, and it's not worth considering
it when it comes to future decisions. 

Same thing here -- let's say that because of the fence-around-the-diet
principle you decide that the oatmeal was a bit too much dessert and
not enough no-S breakfast. Ok, you had it, it's a sunk cost. When
lunch rolls around, don't go &quot;Well, if I had had a different
breakfast..&quot; and don't go &quot;Because I had a bad breakfast&quot;, 
because
neither of those matter -- choose this next meal based on the general
principles of the diet and not on sunk costs.

Best of luck!
