<pre>
    
in australia, most cannoli is savoury. so couldn't you have them as part 
of
your lunch or dinner plate lee?

to me that's one of the great things about no s. you can have whatever 
you
like at the 3 meals, as long you don't have seconds, and the food isn't
sweet?

I think it is vital to only constrain yourself, or keep yourself, within
those rules. otherwise the pressure builds up and it becomes just any other
diet.

yes, apply our encylopedic knowledge of food (which all dieters have) and
make healthy choices as often as possible. but if we don't, then we are
still doing well on no s.

love
jen

Oh, I had a message on my cell voicemail this morning from one of my
&gt; employees saying that he is leaving some cannolis for me that
&gt; someone brought by. Oh No. Can I freeze cannolis for Saturday? I
&gt; will be strong, I will be strong.

Dear Lee, I really have to disagree with Cat's advice (sorry Cat no
disrespect, but freezing cannolis in Lees case is probably a recipe
for disaster, this time not a Hurricaine)

Are you really going to let yourself be sucked into that failure
cycle again, after only one day in?
Listen to your own words and hear them!
You said &quot;Oh no&quot;, now really stop and listen to that...It is 
your
inner voice warning that dangers lie ahead&quot; Don't just say &quot;I 
will
be strong&quot; and expect to have immediate fortress like powers...
Listen to what you really are worried about and accept it...That &quot;Oh
No&quot; is the real message here.
Danger, warning, cannoli attack on the horizon, Run away fast!
...You can't let something that is only 4 inches long tempt you so
much lol :)
I think Oscar Wilde was the one who said the only way to get rid of
Temptation is to &quot;give in to it&quot; Maybe bad advice in regards 
to
cannolis!
But why put yourself into the situation to begin with.
Why make things so much more difficult by even bringing them home...
This was not YOUR plan, you didn't decide, with a clear conscience, I
want a cannoli today because I choose a cannoli, they just
got &quot;brought by&quot; to you by &quot;friends&quot;...what if they bring you 
more
tomorrow and the next day, and the next day...
You don't need to be the place where people can just bring things
by...A desert depository...This is really a trap, get out fast!&quot;
Ask your employees to bring you jewlery, money or something that
won't ruin your success. I'm sure they will help you if you let them
know that you need their support. I never thought I would be quoting
any Republican Administration but in your case I strongly suggest
&quot;Just Say No&quot; LOL
If you really need to torture yourself, go ahead, and see if you feel
happy when you have to spend all of your energy staving off that
craving until Saturday...It will be very draining...Really
be &quot;strong&quot; and be good to yourself by turning down those
&quot;Drive by drop-offs&quot;
I wish you good luck in getting to your goal
Love
Your Friend,
Debbie
