Hey all Nossers :)
How is January treating you all so far? :)
I wanted to write a couple of ideas and experiences thus far for 
me...
First, Thank you Reinhard for your cheer of encouragement on 
Shovelglove... You are the gang leader of the &quot;Pact of Blood&quot; LOL 
:)
That's going great, so no whining today! :) Also, it's great to read 
that &quot;SCIENCE&quot; has validated the common, and obvious intrinsic plus 

of &quot;Stick-to-it-ism&quot; that NoS is based upon! 
People love when they hear clinical stuff to validate what they are 
doing... May I suggest that you include a footnote or link to the 
article or post on your main page, so as to attract scientific 
cerebral types :) You know in the section which begins &quot;Is there any 

scientific proof that this diet works...&quot; you now have enough 
personal success stories from people who have stuck with NoS for 
over a year (the time frame that the article mentioned as a 
measuring stick) Just my humble suggestion though :)

As for eating and the rules, I have to be honest that yesterday, 
once the cold and drizzly weather set in, I sought some comfort in 
ways that aren't NoS approved (still they weren't really horrible, 
just a little setback) at dinner I had seconds on 
chicken...Technically the food might have fit on one plate, if I 
stacked them like lego blocks! But, there you go, one S marginally 
violated, at one of my meals...then again the weather prompted this 
one, I *think*, at 9:00 I had 1 and a half cups of hot 
chocolate...Mine and half of Richards...I kept saying &quot;hey Richard, 

look over there! and then sneaking a sip&quot; ha ha just kidding... he 

just left half and I assumed the &quot;hot chocolate depository&quot; role and 

knocked it off... Oh well, the worst setback, and I am sure this has 
to do with me being very out of whack due to the final two days of 
pms...which is always the boiling point for me, I woke up at around 
3 am and had *another* piece of chicken! Ahhhhh! I was pretty 
disappointed at myself but the power of &quot;autopilot&quot; was on me, and 

in the wee wee hours, it almost felt like I was an innocent 
bystander, watching the carnage on the sidelines in a &quot;dream&quot; in 

which I was powerless to stop myself... I know this isn't true, but 
that's how I felt...Then I paid the price with a nightmare about my 
first relationship with the guy who seems to be hanging onto my mind 
like a barnacle on my brain.. You know that guy, the one who looked 
and acted like David Koresh #2....Hey it's probably time for some 
therapy folks! I can't even sandblast this guy away! LOL... So the 
chicken *definitely* wasn't worth it! LOL Actually, the next time I 
am faced with a nocturnal eating &quot;anomaly&quot; (and for newbies this 

used to not be an anomaly but quite often for me, and these days 
it's around 80% less than before!) which will undo my potential &quot;NoS 

Slash&quot;, I will try very hard to remind myself that it most likely 

will result in a nightmare... Scare tactics might work :)
So, I am giving myself 3/4 of a slash for yesterday and just 
forgiving my bad habit of night eating because this month I am 
counting pms days as &quot;S lenient&quot; occurrences... If I beat myself 

silly I will crush my own momentum, and whether it's officially a 
verbatim 21 days &quot;to perfection&quot; isn't as important to me as knowing 

that my mind is gearing up to succeed and if it's only 80 or 90 
percent, it's better than a week of &quot;autopilot&quot; and bad habits gone 

wild....I almost went out and got the m&amp;ms from my trunk out in my 

car before bedtime (chocolate and pms, a classic combo) but
I DIDN'T!!!!!!!! (that was a desperate moment which ended in triumph)
(Sounds of trumpets blaring in background...)
All in all, I really notice how yucky I feel when I backslide into 
overeating, and my will and habits are much stronger than they have 
been for 37 years...Will can diminish with age, I'm sure some of you 
will agree...but the Spirit lasts forever....They are two forces we 
need to succeed...When will isn't strong enough, and fails 
temporarilly, or is just having a plain old hard time showing itself 
at all, there is always the Spirit there to say...Keep it up! You 
can do it! So stay positive, and try to laugh at the bad times, you 
can learn alot from them... It's a constant motivation for change...
Oh yes! On a happy note, I have gone &quot;medieval&quot; on my self (inspired 

by the Iron Moderator! LOL) and reduced my usual 3 to 4 teaspoons of 
turbinado sugar in my coffee to only 2....my tastebuds will adjust, 
and it's time to nip a very bad habit in the bud.... Just a 
background thing, I used to drink very strong fresh coffee back in 
high school and college (as the creepo boyfriend was also a snob for 
fresh mocha java and french roast, and he &quot;indoctrinated&quot; me too 

LOL, seriously he did lot's of indoctrination back then, and I 
rarely made any decisions for myself...sorry guys this is cheaper 
than calling a shrink, okay back to sugar...) and I was fine with 
two rounded teaspoons of sugar then...after I started using fake 
sweetener, nutrasweet to be exact, my tastebuds got acclimated to a 
much higher level of sweetness, and when, 2 years ago, I finally 
eliminated that toxic chemical from my life, I found my sweet tooth 
couldn't be satisfied with 2 spoons anymore, and it wound up being 
FOUR! So I am hereby going postal on my sugarfied coffee, and going 
back to my two spoons... that should be fine and my tastebuds will 
adjust accordingly...Tough love for a tough &quot;everyday&quot; habit... But 

Reinhard, I can't go completely spartan as you do with Black 
Coffee :) So forget that option..... That's too hardcore for me :)
Have great triumphs today, all!
Accenchuate Da positive :)
Love,
Deb
