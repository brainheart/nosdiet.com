Welcome, Tze.

Seconds were my big problem too. By nature (or years
of bad habits) I didn't have a shut off valve once I
got started. Big firsts were the key to weaning myself
off seconds. Once I had that down, it was relatively
easy to scale down the portions. Social eating helps
here: the fact that you've put so much on your plate
is embarrassing (never mind that you used to eat much
more in multiple servings), and embarrassment is a
*very* potent incentive.

Melanie, if your follow-through is anywhere near as
good as your perception is clear, I'm not worried
about you at all. You hit it on the nail here:

&quot;NoS isn't about willpower versus habit, it's about
using your willpower to change bad habits into better
habits.&quot;

Remember the elephant tamer analogy.

Good luck you both, and keep these posts coming,

Reinhard

&gt; Thanks so much. Yesterday i tot no second plate is

&gt; but today, i thk all of them are equally hard. i m
&gt; taking more and
&gt; more sweet stuff, natural it may be but still...
&gt; 
&gt; Lucily I don't drink coffee, ever since the first
&gt; time i tried it when
&gt; i was alittle kid, many many years ago. After
&gt; reading your mail, i
&gt; have resolute to go out n get some carrots and beet
&gt; roots and apples
&gt; to make a salad.
&gt; 
&gt; But thanks for the positive reinforcement. I will
&gt; work on it bit by
&gt; bit, hopefully i can get to the BIT stage! will
&gt; power -&gt; better
&gt; habit. way to go!
&gt; 
&gt; I need alot of peer support. So pl keep your
&gt; feedback coming!

&gt; 
&gt; I can't say I am already there, but I am getting
&gt; better. Just
&gt; remember to tell yourself you don't have to be
&gt; perfect you just have
&gt; to be better. Just remember with the whole habit
&gt; thing, NoS is'nt
&gt; about willpower versus habit it's about using your
&gt; willpower to change
&gt; bad habits into better habits. Just remember if you
&gt; have a HABIT and
&gt; you get rid of part you still have ABIT. If you get
&gt; rid of still more
&gt; you still have that BIT you can get rid of even more
&gt; but you still
&gt; have IT. So exchange the HABIT for something else. 
&gt; If drinking the
&gt; honey water is a problem on No S days just drink
&gt; water. Save all
&gt; sweets even if they are natural sweets for your S
&gt; days. If your a
&gt; coffee drinking I can not advise you on that one I
&gt; have never touched
&gt; the stuff myself. I did read somewhere though, the
&gt; enzymes in a
&gt; single apple have the same wake-up power of 2 or
&gt; more cups of coffee.
&gt; I can not judge that to be true but it does perk me
&gt; up to have an
&gt; apple with my breakfast or lunch when I am really
&gt; dragging. Best of
&gt; luck to you. Your friend in health Melanie

&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I m new here. But i really like the noSdiet
&gt; system. Because it is 
&gt; &gt; something I tried n tried to do but alas,... 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Will power vs habits
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My version: will power + some distraction + some
&gt; &quot;I am very full now&quot; 
&gt; &gt; + don't start eating + drink diluted soya or honey
&gt; water.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is it playing games with the mind, play it not a
&gt; day, two days. A 
&gt; &gt; life time?! 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Or it is changing habits so we don't need to play
&gt; games anymore?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those who are already there, pl enlighten me!
&gt; Struggling alone is 
&gt; &gt; no fun!
