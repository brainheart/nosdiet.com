Hi Deb, 
If T-Tapp (Teresa Tapp) is done correctly, I don't think that you 
would ever &quot;Out Grow&quot; the benefits of this exercise program. Teresa 

has a very long list of credentials and a lot of work in the progress 
of this program. Is it for everyone, probably not, worth 
investigating, it's up to the individual. Take a look, it's a lot 
harder than one might think at first glance, and about the time you 
think you've got it, it gets harder. Nothing against your trainer, 
but that's usually the response from someone that hasn't tried it. 
Okay, so back to the NoS subect, how long have you been on this WOE 
and what type of results have you had. 
I noticed last night that after preparing heaping plate and couldn't 
finish the whole thing, maybe there's hope for me. I haven't felt 
guilty about anything that I've eaten either. Yea.
Bye for now.
Joyce

&gt; ....Hi Oldies :)
&gt; I will check out your TTap site... From what I understand, 
according 
&gt; to my muscle bound personal trainer who is definitely a very big 
guy,
&gt; isometric movements won't do much for the muscles because you have 

&gt; to work the muscle to the full extent of its range of motion...yes 

&gt; you will develop some endurance and burn some calories to be sure, 

&gt; but to really see results and improve your muscles you have to do, 

&gt; what he called, &quot;progressive overload&quot;... ie, if you don't continue 

&gt; to challenge the muscle, your results won't be optimal.
&gt; But do what you like, because that is a very important factor, and 

&gt; it is usually the deciding factor on whether or not you continue 
any 
&gt; exercise regimen :)
&gt; Hope NoS is going well for you
&gt; Deb
