As a general rule, I just say no thank you and leave it at that. While
some people are surprised -- especially in this office where no one
turns down free food -- as long as I don't make a big deal about it,
no one is offended.

&gt; Yesterday, I was at work for a short while and a co-worker (Walter)
&gt; offered me two bite-size sandwiches that his wife had made for a
&gt; function at her work. They were really small, about one square inch
&gt; each, and very good. One was a carrot-curry spread on white bread 
and
&gt; the other was cashew butter and some kind of jelly on wheat bread. 
I
&gt; took them, and ate them, rather than trying to explain no-s.
&gt; 
&gt; I feel awful, because not only did I have a snack, but one of them 
was
&gt; a sweet. And I did it just because I was too lazy to explain my
&gt; current mindset and eating habits. How do you guys refuse things
&gt; offered to you in the course of a normal day?
&gt; 
&gt; I've not been keeping an actual calendar with slash marks (like I've
&gt; heard you guys writing about) but I don't have a good mark for
&gt; yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise, things are going well.
