dear deb-star

you do have a store of excellent and thought provoking knowledge.

I checked our library catalogue, and it isn't there :( checked the net 
and
of course, there is lots of info, and I can buy it from amazon :) I just
love the net.

the archer allowing the arrow to shot itself, the eater allowing the food 
to
eat itself? a reorientation of thought - even for me who has investigated
buddhism lots - but mostly mahayana. when I read how eugen learnt to shoot
an arrow (in a book review) I found it challenging. particularly so from 
out
fast, fast, faster society.

do you think it will work with food? the concept of allowing an arrow to
shoot itself is accommodatable perhaps because it is external to oneself,
and the mechanism is obvious and human involvement only potentiates that
happening. mmmmm..... as I'm typing these thoughts I'm thinking, well, 
you
could say that for food to. but not quite in the same way.

but, the idea it represents, that our relationship with food becomes so
natural, and of its essence that we don't have to think about it, plan, 
etc,
and worry and fight ...... that would be the ultimate everyday system for
food. :)

massage ------ it is just the best. my belief is that if each person could
have at least 1 massage a week (funded by the state, we have Medicare in
Australia which covers (80%) the cost of lots of medical stuff) the
population would be so much healthier and happier.

several years ago I went to a weekend workshop on massage for larger people.
we got massaged lots as we were each other's practice bodies :) by the 
end
of the weekend everyone looked so much better. my skin just glowed and 
my
body felt limber and happy. you could see how the intensive massage had 
the
blood flowing and had moved all the toxins. even more memorable was a lady
who had started out the weekend very withdrawn and negative, and who had 
a
crinkled, crunkled face with the frown lines and lips lines etc. it turned
out to be a cathartic weekend for her as she processed some past abuse 
in
this loving environment, plus all the massage and by the end of the weekend
her face had opened up like a flower, many of the lines had gone, and her
whole aspect had changed. it was wondrous and astonishing.

lots of love

jen

The teacher who pointed out the stomach pathway, and the energetic
trajectory of the eating process
Look, chew, think, swallow etc., was my absolute favorite at that
school. His name is Tom Banasiak, and earned the nickname, &quot;Zen Tom&quot;
among his students at Swedish Institute. As I mentioned before, I am
a massage therapist, and being grounded and mindful are at the core
of the work. Since you mentioned Zen Buddism, I thought I would
encourage you to look at a great book by the German Philosipher Eugen
Herrigel called &quot;Zen in the art of Archery&quot; you may really enjoy 
it,
I did : ) It's an eastern philosophy classic, and can be read in one
or two sittings.
I think once we adopt these new learned eating behaviours on a
regular basis, it will be like a state of Zen...Just repetition and
sticking to it...
Eventually we wont be able to differentiate between whether we
are &quot;Hitting the target or if the target is hitting us&quot;
Are we eating the food or is the food eating us? LOL : )
