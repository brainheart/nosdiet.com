to respond to cat's question a couple days ago, i've averaged about 
a pound a week so far. like someone else was mentioning, it's been 
a sort of two steps forward, one step back process so far.

i must have missed something with all this low-carb talk. it seems 
to me that adding low-carb to no-s is making the process much harder 
than it needs to be. unless a person already eats very reasonably 
(i would assume that person would already be at an ideal weight and 
have little need for diets) following the no-s diet will certainly 
lead to weight loss, and it allows for eating carbs, protein, and 
fat in a proportion that tastes and feels normal. i would think 
that adding further restrictions would just make it more difficult 
to stick with, and more difficult to achieve permanent results.
