HI again, To speak for my 13yo daughter, She really tries to eat 
healthy, and knows what is good for her and what isn't from watching 
me and listeing to me etc.. She gets so frustrated by her schools 
choices for lunch (so called sald bar with only a few items on it)No 
dark green veges at all she says, that normally she takes 
fruit,pretzels,cheese things like that that can be eaten quickly and 
are not bad for her. She loves fruit smoothies and if only she could 
get them to serve them at school she would be so happy. I totally 
agree, i hate seeing kids that will only eat fried foods, no 
veges,no fruit etc.. The way i have always gotten my children to try 
new things is i ask them to taste it, and they may spit it out if it 
doesnt please them in taste and texture.I have found it works, i 
never force them to eat something they dont like(like my mom did)I 
remember my mom making me eat Cream of Mushroom soup in grade 
school. I threw it up all over the table and to this day i dont 
really care for mushrooms. It really stuck with me. I didnt want my 
kids to have that experience. incidentally i do serve mushroom, but 
only my DH likes them.Anyway we need to teach our kiddos that they 
dont have to eat the crap placed in front of them, better to go 
hungry(providing they get fed at home) I know for some kids that is 
the only meal they get(at school). My kids know they are very 
fortunate to have a Mom who cares about what they eat, has always 
served them fruit and veges.Dont get me wrong we have loved our 
chips and cookies, ice cream etc..but not for meal choices.:) For 6 
years we owned an ice cream store and it was horrible on the health. 
NO you dont get tired of eating it every day.(was asked that ? every 
day for 6 years)Ironically, two of the family are lactose intolerant.
well enough babbling .....

&gt; Oh, of course I agree that children are a different story 
entirely. I weep when I see what they are fed! If you start out 
right, then continue putting only healthy food before a child, they 
will acquire a taste for good food. I hate being around children 
who have always only eaten junk and turn up their noses at healthy 
food.
&gt; 
&gt; The funny thing is that some of the same adults who feed their 
children garbage will tie themselves into knots worrying about every 
ingredient or every latest health scare reported in the news. I 
think that's silly and counterproductive. That is &quot;trying to make 

the food behave.&quot; I don't know how to globally address the problem 

with school food, but occasionally a particular school decides to be 
different--they seem to have a certain amount of freedom to make 
changes. Then you hear reports about grades going up and everyone 
being happier and getting along better (as you say). It's that evil 
sugar, IMHO!

&gt; 
&gt; well that is partially true but the film also shows what our kids 

eat at
&gt; school that is not something they can really choose... they are 
served bad
&gt; foods rather than healthy choices. and he showed that healthy 
choices do not
&gt; cost more than the junk foods many of the schools serve..kids dont 

really
&gt; have the freedom to choose when they are handed a tray of 
food..and the soda
&gt; machines do not need to be there etc.. also many of our 
institutions have
&gt; bad food choices available and he showed how things could be 
different there
&gt; also and how different the behavior was when good foods were 
served rather
&gt; than junk
