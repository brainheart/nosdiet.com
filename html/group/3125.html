im just about to begin my long and wonderous journey along the NoS 
path to eternal happy eating.

i don't think i'll have any problems with it but you never know ;) 
one main problem i foresee is that in about 2 months i'm flying to 
america for my 2nd year working at a summer camp.

for the most part i [hopefully] should be able to easily stick to 
the diet because there is enough variety so that i can choose what i 
want to eat for every meal (as in, for breakfast i can have one of 
several kinds of cereal, or pancakes/waffles/bacon &amp; eggs - whatever 

is cooked that day as well as fruit, so i would just pick the bits i 
want to eat)

another little problem is lack of exercise at the camp. i know we 
walk around all day, but i lack time for other exercises, and access 
to weights/sledgehammers and whatnot. last year all i did was a 
bunch of sit ups and pushups in the tent when i got up/went to 
sleep. anyone have any other ideas of exercises i could do at camp 
with minimal time to myself?

oh i also gave myself reason to do martial arts by teaching any 
fellow counselors who wanted to learn (im not very high in gradings, 
but the basics are easily taught) so we both got a workout. that 
only happened a couple of times over the whole summer though.

wow i type too much..
thanx for any suggestions!
