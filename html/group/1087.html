Sophist,
Please don't get discouraged if people do not respond
immediately to a post. Sometimes it takes people
awhile to get to their Inbox, and sometimes they are
not sure a reply is required. Either way, welcome to
the list.

For Lynda, their is a good deal of philosophy and some
research behind the warrior diet. You can check out
www.warriordiet.com, he can answer all your questions
better than I.

One of the things that I enjoyed about the diet was
having more energy and being 'lighter on my feet'
during the day. Plus, if you are a food enthusiast,
having good, hearty full meals (seconds encouraged,
&lt;wink wink&gt;) the end of day meal is a real treat. The
main reason I didn't continue on the diet, despite
weight loss and philosophy agreements, was that I am a
very social eater. Lunch and breakfast are often eaten
out with coworkers and friends and its tough to sit
and drink tea or coffee when everyone else is eating.
The No S diet fits in with my lifestyle better while
allowing me to watch my weight, too.

Hope this helps.
- Allan

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Welcome back to NoS. I think it will be easier for
&gt; you to reach your goal
&gt; and maintain it doing NoS than doing the warrior
&gt; diet you mentioned.
&gt; 
&gt; Just curious... You mentioned you liked the
&gt; philosophy behind the warrior
&gt; diet. What is the philosophy behind eating most of
&gt; your calories at night?
&gt; It is not something I would choose to do, but I am
&gt; curious as to what the
&gt; creators of this diet believe are the benefits of
&gt; eating at night.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck in reaching your goal. We look forward to
&gt; your updates.
&gt; 
&gt; And no...it is not just you. Reinhard definitely
&gt; has a future in comedy!

&gt; 
&gt; I am hoping the reason I did not get a response from
&gt; my first post is
&gt; because people missed it? Anyway, I just want to
&gt; say that I will be
&gt; trying this diet again. I was doing it but then I
&gt; stumbled across a
&gt; diet called Warrior Diet (basically, undereat on
&gt; veggies/little
&gt; protein during day and then eat most of your
&gt; calories at night). I
&gt; liked the philosophy behind it but decided it was
&gt; too extreme for me
&gt; right now. I am going to try to get these NO S
&gt; habits in my head and
&gt; make them automatic before trying the WD. I plan on
&gt; posting monthly
&gt; results, starting from Aug. 1 (next month). As of
&gt; right now, I am
&gt; roughly 170 lbs, with a 35 or 36. in waist. My goal
&gt; is 150 lbs and
&gt; 10% bodyfat (I think this translates into mebbe 31
&gt; in. waist?).
&gt; 
&gt; I realize these goals might be more specific than
&gt; some others so you
&gt; might find it harder to relate but any encouagement
&gt; is appreciated. I
&gt; enjoy reading all your posts. (Is it me or does
&gt; Reinhard have the
&gt; potential to do irreverent comedy? :-)).
