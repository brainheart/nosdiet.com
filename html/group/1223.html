&gt; Trade up on quality. You don't get as much dessert now
&gt; days, so get the best. Do this and you've turned a
&gt; temptation into a diet aid.

This is a great point and a hidden benefit to No-S. My partner and I
both really enjoy cheese, and we usually had a couple of interesting
cheeses in the house to snack on when we were in a cheese mood. Since
there's less snacking to do now, we buy cheese less often -- but since
we buy some good cheese every few weeks instead of weekly, we've
essentially got 3x the cheese budget we used to have, and we've been
able to enjoy some really good cheeses that previously we'd have called
too expensive.

On a less fancy level, I used to buy pizza pockets for quick dinners,
and after having a couple of them, I'd still be hungry and heat up the
other two in the package, leading to a meal which was one or two pizza
pockets more than what one might be expected to eat -- but I'd feel
silly cooking all four for myself right off the bat. So instead of that,
quick meals tend to be more along the lines of rice and fresh veggies or
pasta and a quickly thrown-together sauce, both of which are way more
enjoyable than the pizza pockets ever were.

Take advantage of the limitations to *really enjoy* what you are
allowed, and not only do you end up eating healthier and losing weight
but you end up treating yourself as a matter of course, even during
meals.
