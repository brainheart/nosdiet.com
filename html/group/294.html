Hi Eleanor,

No smoking *and* no s? Wow, that's a tall order. 

There are a lot of obvious difficulties with doing
both at once, but the thing is, I think your
resolutions *can* feed off each other and help each
other out. Success in one can fuel your resolve in the
other (but the opposite is true too, so be careful).

Since smoking and snacking are at least partly ritual,
it might be good to try to think up a replacement
ritual. Caffeine still ok? :-)

Best of luck,

Reinhard

&gt; Good to know there are some fellow no-S's this side
&gt; of the pond, and beyond. I'm into my second week of
&gt; it now and its going ok. I thought the no snacking
&gt; would be easy as I rarely snacked before; but its
&gt; surprisingly more difficult when you truly cannot
&gt; cheat a little and have the odd packet of crisps or
&gt; such, on a no-S day. I've also given up smoking in
&gt; this last week (after 15 years of pretty much 20
&gt; ciggies every day, so this is no mean feat !!), and
&gt; I'm starting a &quot;three times a week&quot; aerobics class
&gt; from tomorrow . Eeekk!! Decided it was time for a
&gt; complete life change, I thought - well - if yer
&gt; gonna do it, might as well do it all at once!!!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm managing the non-smoking surprisingly well (only
&gt; the odd severe pang), but I'm determined to stop;
&gt; and with the No-S system in place it means I can't
&gt; snack as a replacement, which is... well....
&gt; difficult... but much better in the long term. So -
&gt; if I can get through the next weeks, I reckon It'll
&gt; become a much easier daily system I get used to.
&gt; 
&gt; .... I hope...
&gt; 
&gt; Great to know of all the success stories; its very
&gt; encouraging.
&gt; 
&gt; All the best for a happy, healthy and s-free new
&gt; year

&gt; Hi Eleanor
&gt; 
&gt; I live in Ireland, not too far away. Hope it goes
&gt; great for you. I've lost 
&gt; about 3 stone, I'm not exactly sure 'cos I didn't
&gt; weigh myself at the start.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm spending new year with friends in france. It's
&gt; not no-s friendly, last 
&gt; night I went to a nine-course dinner! But I
&gt; thought 'oh what the hell, make 
&gt; it an s day, it's not often I get to eat out like
&gt; this.'

&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; I'm just starting the No S diet. I'm based in
&gt; Cambridge in the UK and was 
&gt; wondering if I'm the first person from Blighty
&gt; (Britain) to be a part of 
&gt; this diet? I think its a great idea, sensible,
&gt; logical and something I hope 
&gt; I can stick to and make a way of life. A brilliant
&gt; web site, entertaining 
&gt; and highly amusing. Loved it! Fingers crossed I
&gt; can get into the swing of it 
&gt; and shed some pounds... and keep them away! I want
&gt; to lose about 28 pounds 
&gt; (to be back at my old weight), and have a goal of
&gt; reaching that by the time 
&gt; the summer May Balls (great parties) happen (which
&gt; are actually in June.... 
&gt; such is British logic... hmmm.)
&gt; 
&gt; So... 2004.. No S's... here goes...!!

&gt; I know what you mean. I have trouble not eating
&gt; alot but munching on 
&gt; sweets. I cant wait till I no longer have it
&gt; around. I bought some homemade 
&gt; peanut brittle off of a friend and I keep telling
&gt; myself you dont get this 
&gt; but once a year.

&gt; -- well, after 5 
&gt; consecutive S-days, my appetite feels a bit
&gt; unbridled, and I'll be glad when I'm tucked in
&gt; bed reading a Raymond
&gt; Chandler novel. I've been muttering &quot;Fence
&gt; around the diet&quot; to
&gt; myself since finishing dinner.
&gt; 
&gt; One can only hope 5 consecutive S-days will
&gt; ONLY happen during
&gt; the &quot;holiday season.&quot; (This is what happened:
&gt; Dec 24- Christmas Eve,
&gt; Dec 25- Christmas, Dec 26- hosted my own X-mas
&gt; party, Dec 27-28-
&gt; Saturday and Sunday). So today was tough.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thrilled to have a jump on the New Year's
&gt; resolution thing, since
&gt; I began No-essing on Dec 11. Six pounds lost
&gt; (as I believe I've
&gt; mentioned -- sorry for repetition).
