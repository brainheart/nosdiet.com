that is great .. where do you live? we are going into winter now
pomegranates are out right now at christmas they have red seeds about the
size and shape of a corn kernel but very juicy and tangy like cranberry 
only
sweeter.. you eat the seeds and have to pick them out of the pulp so its
something that takes a while to eat plus they are full of antioxidents

I am with you too, Deb.

Cat I have never heard or tasted pomegranates. I will have to check 
it out. Right now on our trees in the yard with fruit are avocados 
and carombola (star apple)and I have a big vegetable and herb 
garden. I had my first red tomato today. I think since my children 
are grown my garden takes their place to watch something grow. One 
son is back from college and the other is going to college here so 
they really aren't away but they are adults and it is different.


Have a good night everyone.
