I am in England and adore Indian food. I'm told what we get here isn't
authentic, but it is delicious. I cook lentils with tomatoes, onions and 
the
aromatic, but not the hot spices myself.

&gt; Hi Cat,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I missed out on the western food, my weight was attributable to over
&gt; generous servings of white rice at home, then with binge drinking
&gt; and eating I really lost control. So at 26, I made the decision to
&gt; become fit and am half the way there.
&gt;
&gt; India is a place of extremes, 60% of this city lives in slums and
&gt; are poor and then there is the 300-million strong middle class,
&gt; which is the target of McDonalds and other food chains. We are just
&gt; starting to see a rise in fat kids fed on fast food, and there are
&gt; quite a few obese adults. Once you move away from the cities, in
&gt; non-urban areas, if one is fat then U must be from the city or else
&gt; a rich person. Oh and yes, many people are dying from starvation
&gt; that's the other extreme.
&gt;
&gt; The Indian fast food contains potatoes, oil, butter but it is
&gt; nothing like the McDonalds food or any other chains. There was a
&gt; big controversy when it was discovered that fries were fried in oil
&gt; with beef fat. Everything is coated with sugar for gloss and
&gt; cheese. Cheesy pizzas with 3000 calories. I feel so guilty when I
&gt; have them but then I have it twice or thrice a year. Some of the
&gt; indians who have been to the US find the food very fattening and if
&gt; they dont watch it, they can just put on weight even if they have
&gt; been healthy adults all their life. But they do admit that American
&gt; food is tasty like hell. Is Homer Simpson the ideal American?
&gt;
&gt; I will share more gory details of my story of losing weight.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; welcome AJ and good job so far
&gt; &gt; do you attribute your weight to westerizing of the food or the
&gt; portions of food available?? is it becoming more common over there
&gt; to have weight problems??
