Subject: [nosdiet] Hey, this actually works


Well, I've been No-S-ing for about 9 months, and have lost about 15
lbs. One of the biggest difficulties I have been running into is
dealing with food at the office. Often people bring in stuff just for
the heck of it - it's usually not difficult to turn that down. But
frequently - maybe once every couple weeks - people bring in sweets
that are homemade, or bring in celebratory food for things such as
promotions, birthday, etc. From a social standpoint, it can be
difficult to turn that kind of stuff down (especially the homemade
stuff), not to mention the regular temptations of having something
nice and tasty across the hall.

Anyone else have this kind of issue? Any good ways of dealing with
it? Granted, I suppose if I'm still losing weight, it must not be
*that* big of a problem, but this is still an issue... I definitley
see consequences on the scale when this happens.
