Hey Group, I own a shirt which is from my massage school which has a 
special Chinese character, in calligraphy style, on it...When people 
ask me what it means, I tell them it roughly translates into 
something halfway between &quot;Whatever&quot; and &quot;Don't Worry&quot;...Boy I 

should have taken it's advice this week... I expended so much more 
energy than I needed to stressing out over tonight.
We wound up having such a great time trick or treating...I invited 
one of Richards little friends to join us and they were dressed as a 
pirate and a mummy :) Most people thought Richard had plastic 
surgery, with all the bandages, and this being Great Neck and 
all...Most girls around here graduated high school with either a 
porsche or a nose job, in time for the prom! (and you could tell 
they all went to the same doctor because they all had the same nose)

I so unnecessarily stressed myself out over this...We had such a fun 
time, especially with it being a Sunday. It was a beautiful evening 
to walk around, almost balmy, no need for a jacket even... I count 
it as a Suburban Ranger experience...And I got to go down streets I 
usually don't visit, checking out the cool spooky Halloween displays.

It's funny (and a bit alarming to me) how much I can rationalize my 
worries and fears over control issues...Keeping things in control, 
and overplanning ahead of time are some characteristics I seem to 
have inherited from my super-duper planner mom... For her, life 
can't go on without plans for everything...plan plan plan....I wish 
I could say I was more laid back then that, but my worries this 
week, seem to point out some things which need to be cultivated....I 
guess the Candy Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
..personal improvement can only begin with awareness.

I am going to really try and remember this week and learn from it. 
Worrying about how to stay in control and plan for future events 
shouldn't take center stage... I feel like I learned that tonight.
Keep things simple and stay in the present moment.

For me this is so much easier said than done, but I have a lifetime 
to learn :)
Love,
Debbie
