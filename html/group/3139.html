&gt; Hi Karen, 
I conquered my pepsi addiction slowly ,first by making it an s 
therefore only good on the weekends and then backing off from there. 
i actually had my first one this past weekend after about a month, 
and i tell you it didnt really taste that great anymore. It is no 
longer a crutch i need to get me through the day. I much prefer a 
good cup of coffee if i need a pick me up in the middle of the day. 
At nite i find if i eat enough at dinner i dont need tv snacks and 
in fact it makes me mad when DH continues to bring them in and offer 
them to me. Sipping on a glass of water or glass of wine through the 
evening helps and is better for me than the box of crackers or bowl 
of popcorn.Also if its not in the house you wont eat it, so be kind 
to yourself and get rid of your fave snacks and only buy for the 
weekend if you really really want it. Even smaller portion bags or 
boxes of stuff, pint of ice cream instead of a half gallon. I tell 
you every little bit helps :) I remember what it was like staying 
home with my little ones, it was so hard to lose weight when you 
felt you were in the kitchen all day. If only i had Nos back then 
instead of the crazy fad diets i would go on, lose on and gain it 
all back in a year ! Thank God you are young and can learn this now 
and not when you are much older like some of us ( we know who we are)
LOL i was remembering my first few days of Nos, i was ravenous esp 
the first day, Rein pretty much told me to just eat more at each 
meal time until i figured out how much i needed to eat to be 
satisfied. So anyway enough rambling keep in touch, we are here for 
you.
Julie
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks so much Deb. Last night was so rough. It is as if I can't 
&gt; watch tv unless I am eating. Even though I am not &quot;hungry&quot;. I do 

&gt; like the coffee idea. I drink mine black, so I believe that is a 
&gt; suitable solution to pop. I also bought some green tea. Any 
&gt; suggestions on curbing the late night snacking that I have become 

so 
&gt; great at??

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all. I feel so fortunate to have stumbled upon this group. 

&gt; My 
&gt; &gt; name is Karen, I am married with a 15 month old son named 
&gt; Benjamin. 
&gt; &gt; I have been using him as my excuse for not getting back in shape 

&gt; &gt; after the pregnancy. I quit my job when he was born, and this is 

&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; first time I have ever stayed at home for so long. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ...Hey Karen! Welcome :)
&gt; &gt; Congrats on your new moherhood status.... the hardest non-paid 

job 
&gt; &gt; around!
&gt; &gt; I know what you're talking about... I didn't work full time 
untill 
&gt; &gt; my son was over 4 years old, and those first two years were 
killer 
&gt; &gt; hard... You're giving so much to Benjamin, now congratulate 
&gt; yourself 
&gt; &gt; for also making YOU a priority... I think most new moms have 

&gt; &gt; that &quot;clean the plate&quot; bad habit... Well here's two other 

options, 
&gt; &gt; tupperware, and le garbage...
&gt; &gt; I believe wasting food is a big time shame, so if your son 
doens't 
&gt; &gt; have a huge appetite, why not give him one less scoop of mac and 

&gt; &gt; cheese? As far as soda is concerned, if you can cut that out 

for 
&gt; &gt; even 50 percent of your usual intake, you will be helping 
yourself 
&gt; &gt; in huge ways! The great thing about NoS is that you really get 

a 
&gt; &gt; new chance every day, and it's designed to help you in the long 

&gt; &gt; run...
&gt; &gt; I lost weight at about 3 different times since my son was born, 

&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; different short term fixes... but once I went &quot;off&quot; it all just 

&gt; came 
&gt; &gt; right back on over one year of terrible overeating... I am proud 

&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; say that I've been with NoS since last August and got through 

the 
&gt; &gt; rough Winter doldrums without packing on an additional 10-20 

lbs...
&gt; &gt; My son Richard, who will be celebrating his ninth birthday next 

&gt; &gt; Tuesday, is doing a 75% version of NoS with me... We have cut 

&gt; &gt; snacking and sweets down to only 2 or 3 days a week for him, as 

&gt; &gt; opposed to every day last year, and he has dropped 2 inches from 

&gt; his 
&gt; &gt; previously, starting to get &quot;husky&quot; tummy...I am so proud of 

&gt; him... 
&gt; &gt; Just yesterday, my mom had offered him half of a baked potato.. 

&gt; Well 
&gt; &gt; our dinner wasn't totally ready yet and he simply said &quot;Not 

right 
&gt; &gt; now grandma.. On NoS we have to wait until it's mealtime to 
eat..&quot; 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; thought I would burst with happiness! There's nothing wrong 
with 
&gt; &gt; half a baked potato, but thank goodness he isn't falling into 

&gt; &gt; the &quot;eat whenever food is presented to you&quot; mode, and is 

&gt; practicing 
&gt; &gt; restraint... If we all ate all day, we would all get fat... 
Okay, 
&gt; if 
&gt; &gt; you are doing so much activity and are in the under 25 age 
range, 
&gt; &gt; this might not yet apply to you, but eventually, eating all day, 

&gt; &gt; results in gaining... As for me, I'd like to lose about 7 or 8 

&gt; more 
&gt; &gt; inches from my waist, and somewhere between 30-40 lbs...I am 

&gt; &gt; starting to break my plateau again and I lost about 1.5 lbs this 

&gt; &gt; week, but because I am doing regular weight lifting with 
&gt; &gt; Shovelglove, my body isn't dropping weight as much as &quot;fat and 

&gt; &gt; inches&quot;... I am down about 3 inches from my waist and 2 inches 

&gt; from 
&gt; &gt; my arms... Yay!
&gt; &gt; So it's no little thing that NoS is a livable and &quot;Sanity 

&gt; Friendly&quot; 
&gt; &gt; plan, because, as Reinhard states in his homepage, unless you 

can 
&gt; &gt; see yourself on any diet for the rest of your life, you might as 

&gt; &gt; well not even start it... Most diet research backs this up... 

&gt; Don't 
&gt; &gt; worry if you don't get it perfect immediately... Long term 
success 
&gt; &gt; is like that &quot;tortoise and hare&quot; story... If you gear up for NoS 

&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; behave like other quicker methods, you will be disappointed, as 

it 
&gt; &gt; is really more a maintainence style of eating... I say, if you 

can 
&gt; &gt; focus on your worst habits first... the soda, and the &quot;I am a 

&gt; plate 
&gt; &gt; cleaning vacuum mom mouth&quot; then you will be off to a great 

start...
&gt; &gt; It took about 5 or 6 months to change my portion sizes, but I am 

&gt; &gt; thrilled to say, that it just happened naturally... painlessly...
&gt; &gt; You will be setting a great example for your whole family and 

&gt; &gt; especially your son who will follow in your footsteps.
&gt; &gt; Reinhard is the greatest group leader, and we are all the 
luckiest 
&gt; &gt; people for finding NOS! Write anytime you need a lift or feel 

&gt; like 
&gt; &gt; tooting your horn. We are all here to help :)
&gt; &gt; Peace,
&gt; &gt; Deb
