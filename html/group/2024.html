&gt; HI Bonnie, Thats great, You are so right about only cheating 
ourselves. I love going to bed a little hungry, knowing i will feel 
thinner when i get up. I am so with you for Thanksgiving. My mom in 
law always does dinner and its enough to feed the block. Looking 
forward to Pecan Pies. It will be w wonderful S weekend.
&gt;...I watched him eat a Sliver every night.

Why watch him?? what torture girl !!:O
&gt; Let him SS all by himself, if thats possible. I hawe my DH on 
board with me for this so its much easier., although he is the snack 
king.I heard him get in the pantry the other night and i yelled in 
and asked him what he thought he was doing, he said popcorn,I said &quot; 

a SNACK&quot; and he changed his mind just like that. Thank God because i 

am not sure if i could have resisted that buttery popcorn.That bossy 
attitude sure comes in handy :) Enjoy your SS days, dont forget to 
really think about what you want and dont cheat yourself with 
something that isnt your fave. tootleloo Julie
&gt;
