 HI Bonnie
I did Atkins for years and it worked til I stopped smoking and started
pushing food to sub for cigs, When I first started I did not snack very
much at all and then here we had no low carb snacks. 
I am trying to go 21 days without a cheat and it really is not too bad 
once
I put my mind to it.
How about posting what you eat here each day or reporting in that you did
not cheat? That may help.

Dear Fellow No S'es, 
My biggest problem other that Snacks is &quot;other diets&quot;. I have no 
problem
with No Sugar, and no problem with no Seconds. But when I low carb, then 
I
feel a need to Snack. I know I Should Not Lo Carb... 
But have been brain washed into thinking this is all that works, from the
media hype, but it makes me get hypoglycemic, therefore I need to Snack.
Hope fully I have found the solution with the Peanut Butter Diet, which is 
a
lot like the Meditterean diet, very healthy, Peanut Butter has a limit 
for
sure, but it keeps me from getting hypo, without turning into a hippo,
hopefully, and includes good carbs, whole grains, beans, fruit, veges, 
a
little meat and a little low fat dairy, so that is different than low carb,
but keeps me full and happy. 
Hopefully this combo will work for me, and I can continue without the Snacks

Bonnie
