Hi everyone. I was posting here a few months ago and following NoS for a 
c=
ouple of weeks. I love NoS and have told so many people about it!! I just=
returned from a cruise and decided prior to the cruise to go on one last 
=
=91quick-fix=92 diet to drop a few extra pounds rather quickly. I did that=
and now the cruise is over (wonderful, wonderful time) and I am back to 
No=
S.=20=20

=20

I have done many diets in the past =96 Weight Watchers (lifetime member), 
A=
tkins, Scarsdale, Slimfast, Formula, the Zone. I am tired of either being 
=
ON A DIET or ON A BINGE! I really don=92t know a happy medium and really, 
=
truly believe that NoS is just what I need. It provides just the right 
bou=
ndaries without being so restrictive that I am either starving or craving. 
=
I know that any food I want is never more than 5 days away.=20=20=20

=20

I did weigh myself this morning and gained ONLY 5 pounds on the cruise =96 
=
this included 3 days in New Orleans and 5 days on the ship. I ate and dran=
k practically around the clock =96 so 5 pounds is a blessing. I know the 
p=
ounds will not fall off like they did with Scarsdale, but I also know that 
=
I am giving up all the mind games I had to play to stick with diets in the 
=
past.=20=20

=20

I am hoping to post here often and will let you know how my first days go. 
=
I am going to use the RED SLASH method of marking off my calendar to measu=
re my success.

=20
Mary
