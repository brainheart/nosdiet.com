Hi Daniela,

Welcome, and good luck.

I think nosdiet makes sense for people like you who
already have relatively good habits because:

1) Never underestimate the power of self deception.
It's so easy to fool yourself into thinking you aren't
overeating if you have a zillion little meals. If you
stick with three, there are just three windows of
opportunity for you to zealously monitor. Much
trickier to sneak things by. If you overeat, you'll
know it.

2) There's no downside. Even if it doesn't give you
any extra boost (though I think it should), you'll at
least have a cheaper dental bill. And you can finally
*enjoy* those desserts, come the week end.

Sorry you seem to have gotten stuck with such an
efficient calorie processor of a body. We each have to
play with the cards we're dealt, I guess.

Reinhard

&gt; I'm ceridwenhurdle's friend. I guess I am officially
&gt; a noS dieter. I 
&gt; am very excited about this and I'm determined to
&gt; make it happen. 
&gt; 
&gt; My friend and I are both college students. We're
&gt; hoping that by the 
&gt; time school comes around again, we will have formed
&gt; good habbits and 
&gt; won't have to work so hard on it- leaving more time
&gt; for concentrating 
&gt; on school.
&gt; 
&gt; Ceridwen and I have different problems. I already
&gt; have pretty good 
&gt; (semi good)eating habbits and I exercise regularly.
&gt; Ceridwen, on the 
&gt; other hand doesn't seem to care what or how much she
&gt; eats and she 
&gt; doesn't care much for movement of any kind. This is
&gt; funny because 
&gt; Ceridwen is the skinny one- I need to loose a little
&gt; weight, she 
&gt; needs a healthier lifestyle.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure we'll both keep you posted on our progress.
&gt; And I look 
&gt; forward to reading about every one else's progress.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm excited!
