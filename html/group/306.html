&gt; &gt; So in no particular order, here we go:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Reinhard- since you say you eat a lot of oatmeal
&gt; &gt; because it's 
&gt; &gt; portable and easy, what kind of oatmeal is it? I
&gt; &gt; would assume that 
&gt; &gt; it's not the &quot;instant&quot; kind (less healthy). So, I
&gt; &gt; guess I wonder how 
&gt; &gt; the fully cooked type is considered portable. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It takes me about 2 minutes to prepare my oatmeal
&gt; lunch. I don't use pre-cooked instant oats, but
&gt; regular, old-fashioned rolled oats. I like my oatmeal
&gt; chewy, so just pouring hot water over them from the
&gt; spigot at work and letting it sit for a minute cooks
&gt; them just fine for my taste. I guess it winds up
&gt; eating more like Musli than traditional oatmeal. It's
&gt; not quite raw, but close. I used to buy &quot;Old Wessex
&gt; Brand Scottish Oats&quot; which lives up to it's billing as
&gt; &quot;Chewy * Chewy * Chewy.&quot; Some other other brands I'd
&gt; tried were too mushy for my taste even though I hardly
&gt; cook them at all. I now buy from the bulk bins at my
&gt; local supermarket, since I've discovered they're just
&gt; as good (and cheaper). As I posted previously, I try
&gt; to always include nuts of somekind, dried fruit of
&gt; some kind, and seeds of some kind, alternating the
&gt; varieties as I run out to keep from getting bored. Not
&gt; low calorie, but filling as cement, reasonably
&gt; healthy, and I do actually enjoy it.
&gt; 
&gt; On weekends I'll sometimes cook up a batch of the
&gt; super hard core steel cut oats. That takes about half
&gt; an hour, but is worth it when you have time. Very
&gt; tasty, and leftovers reheat well. 
&gt; 


&quot;super hard core steel cut oats&quot;:

I have heard of these, but have never seen them in real life. All I 
have seen in the supermarket is Quaker Oats (natural kind, not the 
quick cook), and the various other brands (store private labels) of 
essentially the same thing. Where can one readily find the steel cut 
variety? Do they sell them in a package or only bulk? What do they 
look like? What's the difference? How do you cook them? How much do 
they cost?
