----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Valerie Akers&quot; &lt;valakers@...&gt;
&gt;&gt;Remember Winston Churchill's famous speech? =) (If not, I'll quote 
it
&gt;&gt;next time.)

&gt;I don't remember. Please quote it next time.

Well, it's alternately quoted as:
&quot;Never give up. Never give up. Never give up.&quot;
or
&quot;Never, never, never, never give up&quot;
but after doing a quick search, I've just discovered that both of these are 

misquotes! See:
<a href="http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=435">http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=435</a>

Turns out that the original quote was: &quot;Never, never, in nothing great or 

small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and 

good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming 

might of the enemy.&quot;

Hmm, well, we could apply this to No S with a bit of editing, but otherwise 

it's a bit too full of grandeur for everyday life. Isn't that funny...yet 

ANOTHER thing that &quot;everyone knows&quot; is proven to be wrong. I can't count 

the times this has happened. Hooray for the Internet. =)

[snip]
&gt;&gt;For me, &quot;boredom&quot; doesn't mean I have nothing to do;
[snip]

&gt;EXACTLY!! I am a technical writer for a large IT company, and I work 
on
some of the most boring stuff imaginable -- requirements definition
documents, procedure manuals -- stuff nobody really wants to read. I have
plenty to do, but nothing I'm particularly interested in...

Oh dear. I do feel for you. We shall have to go on encouraging each other! 

I do some editing too, and people have often said I should try technical 

writing, but good grief, I'm bored enough already with only semi-technical 

stuff, and I know I'd be asking for trouble to get into that!

Well, here's one more suggestion. You may have learned this already, but I 

find that it helps to surround myself with stimuli for my other senses--the 

ones for which indulgence does not lead to overweight. Music (headphones if 

necessary), art on the walls, pretty things on the desk, beautiful computer 

screensavers or wallpaper, fragranced candles if allowed...you get the idea. 

Maybe I should get some fluffy/furry pillows next!

When I do eat, I also try to make my food interesting--savory seasonings, 

pungent flavors, or different textures. It might sound silly to some people 

who are happy with bland food, but I go a bit crazy when the food is boring 

for too many meals. Also, have you discovered seltzer water? It may be an 

acquired taste, but it's so good with a bit of lemon or lime--again, it's 

just more *interesting* than plain water!

Diane
