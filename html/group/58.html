Brian,

Yes, we wage slaves here in the states have it nice
and simple in that regard! There's not a whole lot of
damage you can do in 2 weeks.

For citizens of more enlightened countries, it's a
little more complex. I haven't had to think about this
too much myself (grumble, grumble), so this advice may
not be very helpful.

Here are some ideas:

1) Do as Justin says and take S days on V days only
when you are traveling somewhere come across something
really unique that would be a shame not to experience.
I like this in principle, but it's kind of mushy and
open to abuse.

2) Pretend you are an American wage slave and get only
2 weeks (S-day) vacation! If you can get over the
cultural imperialism factor, it still may be
unsatisfying because it involves keeping track of
these days, which is a drag.

3) Be a no-s puritan and don't take any V-days as
S-days. I'm not sure you'd be fully human if you could
pull this off, I write it here just to get it out of
the way.

4) Say to yourself &quot;you know, I'm going to try to
treat vacation days no-S, but I'll be a little more
tolerant of screw ups.&quot; Also, if I indulge a single S,
I won't just throw up my hands in defeat and start
gorging. This is more or less what I've done, but I
can't say it was a resounding success, and if I'd had
six weeks the results might not have been pretty.

5) Permit yourself a single S-event a vacation day.
One dessert, one massive multi course meal, etc. I
like this idea, but I haven't tried it yet. I think
it's what I'll do next vacation, if that day ever
comes... 

6) Being unemployed or retired does not count as
vacation. Vacation means going somewhere, for
pleasure, for a limited time.

I think the biggest danger is not the vacation itself,
but the danger that you'll think &quot;hell, I really
screwed up. Forget this.&quot; when you come back. So while
you should go in with some idea of how to brake your
appetite, be prepared to give yourself some leeway.

Anyway, let us know what you do and how it works. And
have a nice vacation!

Reinhard

&gt; dear richard and fellow no-s'ers
&gt; 
&gt; i'm really getting on great with this diet. For two
&gt; months now i don't think 
&gt; I've ever eaten in such a balanced way. feeling
&gt; really good and weight is 
&gt; slowly melting away.
&gt; 
&gt; My query is about s days on vacation, because really
&gt; on vacation every day 
&gt; is a kind of s day, isn't it? And over here in
&gt; europe we have about 6 weeks 
&gt; vacation every year, so... it could be a problem!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm open to hints and suggestions.
