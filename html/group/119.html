&gt; Keven,

&gt; Congratulations on making it your first weekend, even
&gt; if it was only part of a week and there were some
&gt; stretchers. If it takes a few days to find your
&gt; stride, don't worry about it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Strictness is a tool, not an end in itself. But I find
&gt; that strictness makes it easier, and it's what I'd
&gt; advise most people to try. I'm thrilled that Teresa
&gt; has lost weight using No-s, and I don't begrudge her
&gt; her few candy corns (congratulations, Teresa, and
&gt; sorry for responding to two posts at once). But I
&gt; personally would rather not have to worry about &quot;some&quot;
&gt; turning into &quot;way too much.&quot; &quot;No&quot; is harder to 
sneak
&gt; up on. Do what works for you of course, and best of
&gt; luck.

&gt; &gt; Well, at the mid point of day 2, let me tell you a
&gt; &gt; bit more about my
&gt; &gt; &quot;situation.&quot;
&gt; &gt; I work in the athletic department of a high school. 
&gt; &gt; I'm not a teacher, I'm
&gt; &gt; not a coach, I just do random stuff. I'm basically
&gt; &gt; an assistant athletic
&gt; &gt; director, though this district doesn't officially
&gt; &gt; have one. The point of
&gt; &gt; this, is I make dirt for money, but the department
&gt; &gt; makes up for it by giving
&gt; &gt; me kick backs. Coke, which we stock the machines
&gt; &gt; throughout the school, and
&gt; &gt; sell at sporting events, is mine for the taking (and
&gt; &gt; Dasani water is what we
&gt; &gt; sell, which is the sodium containing water...yuk).
&gt; &gt; This is kinda the point where it doesn't matter if
&gt; &gt; I'm late, so long as I'm
&gt; &gt; in by the time school starts, I'm SUPPOSED to be
&gt; &gt; there a half hour ahead of
&gt; &gt; time.
&gt; &gt; Anyway...Yesterday I did well, until I realized I
&gt; &gt; was going to dinner with
&gt; &gt; some old co-workers, we went to Baker's
&gt; &gt; Square...Couldn't pass up some pie,
&gt; &gt; so I kinda made it a special day, that was all I did
&gt; &gt; though, no snacks, no
&gt; &gt; pop.
&gt; &gt; Today at work, first we get the concession stand
&gt; &gt; delivery in, so what do I
&gt; &gt; do for a half hour? Yeah, I stick M&amp;M's and
&gt; &gt; Snickers on a shelf. That was
&gt; &gt; hard to pass up, but I made it. Then we get a fund
&gt; &gt; raiser rep. in showing
&gt; &gt; us his different candy options, and since last time
&gt; &gt; he came around, we got
&gt; &gt; him 2 of our coaches buying from him, he gave us
&gt; &gt; free samples...We each got
&gt; &gt; about 5 bags of M&amp;M's. Wow, was it hard not eating
&gt; &gt; them on the way home.
&gt; &gt; I'll save 'em for those S days though.
&gt; &gt; Right now, I'm hungry, and wanting a snack, so I'm
&gt; &gt; gonna go mow the lawn. I
&gt; &gt; guess 2 good things will come about with this,
&gt; &gt; housework will get done too,
&gt; &gt; 'eh?
&gt; &gt; Thanks again for listening, and giving out this
&gt; &gt; whole idea.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Kevin
&gt; &gt; &quot;I'm treading the thin line between fat and phat.&quot;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome and good luck! Here's my take on the two
&gt; &gt; &gt; issues you raise:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for the pop, nothing beats water, obviously,
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; you might want to consider tea as well. If you
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; one of those hot water spigots at the cooler it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; fast, and if they give away pop, they probably
&gt; &gt; give
&gt; &gt; &gt; away tea, too. If you are sensitive to caffeine,
&gt; &gt; green
&gt; &gt; &gt; tea is very weak and supposed to have all kinds of
&gt; &gt; &gt; health benefits. Herbal teas have no caffeine. I'm
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; crazy about tea, I prefer coffee, but it's just so
&gt; &gt; &gt; easy and less contentious in terms of health. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; hot, so you drink it slow, and the little ritual
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the tea bag seems to fulfill my &quot;looking for oral
&gt; &gt; &gt; distraction&quot; requirement.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for the pop-tarts/nutrigrain bars for breakfast
&gt; &gt; &gt; issue, I'm not a picky eater, and since my wife
&gt; &gt; needs
&gt; &gt; &gt; to get up way before I do, I tend not to be in a
&gt; &gt; huge
&gt; &gt; &gt; rush in the mornings. So I can't speak to your
&gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; from vast personal experience.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've always considered cold cereal pretty quick,
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; it sounds like you need to be out so fast you're
&gt; &gt; &gt; eating in the car... not the most conducive
&gt; &gt; &gt; environment to cheerio consumption. You know, 5
&gt; &gt; extra
&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes might put cold cereal within striking
&gt; &gt; range.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Would setting the alarm clock 5 minutes earlier be
&gt; &gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the question? Or could you keep a stash of
&gt; &gt; cereal
&gt; &gt; &gt; and milk at work? Or do what I do, keep a stash of
&gt; &gt; &gt; oatmeal, nuts and dried fruit at work (though I
&gt; &gt; &gt; usually eat this for lunch). If you could do one
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; these it would expand your horizons significantly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are *a lot* of different kinds of low/no
&gt; &gt; sugar
&gt; &gt; &gt; cereal.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bread is also a big category - it's not just
&gt; &gt; toasted
&gt; &gt; &gt; wonder or thomases english muffins. Mix it up with
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; different cheese and a different piece of fruit
&gt; &gt; every
&gt; &gt; &gt; morning and even the same old bread can seem
&gt; &gt; novel. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't know your exact tastes in this depeartment,
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; spend some time seriously scoping out the bakery,
&gt; &gt; &gt; cheese and fruit sections are your supermarket.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll wrack my brains about it a bit, but for the
&gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; being I'd suggest not letting this problem be a
&gt; &gt; diet
&gt; &gt; &gt; breaker for you. Pop tarts are clearly out. But
&gt; &gt; &gt; nutrigrain bars might be considered temporarily
&gt; &gt; exempt
&gt; &gt; &gt; until you can think of something less sugary.
&gt; &gt; After
&gt; &gt; &gt; all, they are *marketed* as healthy, and all
&gt; &gt; things
&gt; &gt; &gt; considered, are probably less awful for you than
&gt; &gt; pop
&gt; &gt; &gt; tarts. Emphasis on 'temporary,' and don't let it
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; every day. Hopefully you'll get enough
&gt; &gt; alternatives
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggested here in this group (and by the mother of
&gt; &gt; &gt; invention) that you won't have to resort to this
&gt; &gt; &gt; often/at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I stumbled upon this site today through ask
&gt; &gt; jeeves.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't remember
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question I had, but it wasn't even about
&gt; &gt; weight
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loss. I decided
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this may very well be the way I've been
&gt; &gt; looking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for to loose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight all this time. I've gained ~60 pounds in
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last 4 years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most being in the last 2 years. The other night
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to stop drinking pop like I do...Which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constantly. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard since I get it free at work, and the
&gt; &gt; bottled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water here has a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant amount of sodium, so you just end up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more thirsty after
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drinking it, but I'm gonna do it. This is just
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step up for me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I'm pretty sure I can handle most of it
&gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the bat, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of it soon. Thanks for making this
&gt; &gt; availible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now for a question that I know has been
&gt; &gt; addressed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not &quot;to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfaction.&quot; Breakfast, I wake up litterally
&gt; &gt; 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes before I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to be at work, and it's a 20 minute
&gt; &gt; drive.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (yes I'm late
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every day, but that's a whole 'nother story)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nutrigrain bars and pop
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarts have been a Godsend to me. Not only that
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm a VERY picky
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eater, and most common breakfast foods are not
&gt; &gt; to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liking. I do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love a good bowl of Cheerios or something like
&gt; &gt; that,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I frankly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't have the time for them. Toast is great,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; english muffins
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too...but every day? I don't think I'd like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that...Any other ideas
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out there...Maybe there was some of this
&gt; &gt; addressed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I either
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glanced over it or missed it in the archive,
&gt; &gt; sorry
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it is just a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repeat. Thanks for the help!!
