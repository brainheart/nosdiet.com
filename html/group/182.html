I can't eat bananas, I choaked on one when I was child, and since then I've 

found myself unable to eat them. I have tried...I think they smell good, but 

I just can't eat them. Recipe 1 I've done with strawberries. Maybe if I try 

that with bananas, I just may be able to do it. If that works, I'll try 

recipe 2. Thanks for the ideas :)

&gt; Hi Teresa,
&gt; You mentioned that you love to bake goodies around the holidays. I 
was
&gt; thinking that if you got yourself a baking substitute list, then 
&gt; eating your baked goodies won't do so much damage this year.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm talking about a list that will tell you that you can substitute
&gt; applesauce for butter and the like. I know there are plenty of lists 

&gt; like that. You could probably find one on the internet or at Amazon.com.
&gt; 
&gt; If you can cut the calories and fat in some of your recipes, then 

&gt; you can still enjoy your baking without feeling too guilty.
&gt; 
&gt; My mom always used applesauce in her recipes and there was no 
&gt; sacrifice in taste or texture in her baked goodies.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are 2 recipes for imitation icecream. I haven't tried them,
&gt; yet. But, I plan to do so, soon. I have my bananas in the freezer 

&gt; ready for me when I get the time. I have heard rave reviews about 

&gt; the taste and texture of these recipes.
&gt; 
&gt; Recipe 1
&gt; Take very ripe bananas, peel them, chop them up and place them in a 
freezer
&gt; bag. Freeze solid. Puree in food processor adding a little milk or 
soymilk
&gt; to a creamy consistency. Yummy!
&gt; 
&gt; Recipe 2
&gt; Blend 4 bananas in the processor
&gt; Add	2T unsweetened cocoa powder
&gt; 1tsp vanilla extract,
&gt; 2T maple sugar.
&gt; Blend till smooth and put in custard cups.
&gt; Put in freezer till just frozen (serves 6)
&gt; 
&gt; I would think you could add strawberries or other fruit in with the 
bananas
&gt; for a variation of taste. I won't be adding the maple sugar to mine 

&gt; when I make it.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope these recipes will help fulfill your cravings for something 

&gt; extra to eat once in a while after dinner without adding the sugar,
&gt; calories or fat.
&gt; 
&gt; As for your Father-in-Law... my bet is that he will gain all his 
&gt; weight back and then some. :) His &quot;diet&quot; didn't teach him anything 

&gt; about portion control, healthy choices, rewarding yourself or any 

&gt; other long-term, way-of-life living habits.

&gt; 
&gt; I haven't been doing so well lately and the scales show it. Last night
&gt; after a satisfying dinner I still wanted soemthing sweet. I ate an 
apple
&gt; over the course of about an hour and then a handful of raisins. Somewhere
&gt; I've got this thing in my head that says after a meal I need 
&gt; something sweet. Last night hasn't been the only infraction.
&gt; 
&gt; Sunday at a restaurant I told my father-in-law about the no &quot;S&quot; 

&gt; diet. He said, &quot;I like the Atkins, I lost 12 pounds.&quot; He went on 

&gt; to elaborate that he only did it for a few weeks a month or so ago,
&gt; but it worked. I told him no one can maintain such a regimen for 
&gt; too long, and it's too hard, besides being unhealthy. He shrugged 

&gt; me off.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't consider this a &quot;diet&quot; but a lifestyle I must maintain the 

&gt; rest of my life. My brain accepts that, but I also love food. I've 

&gt; never been really overweight, but there are clothes in my closet I 

&gt; can't wear in public. I could use a pep talk as the weekend is 
&gt; coming up and the holidays are right around the corner. Did I 
&gt; mention I love to bake goodies around the holidays
