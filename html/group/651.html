Interesting way of finding the site. 
I thought giving up soda was going to be the worst thing ever for me...I 

drank 2-3 cans of coke a day, and a bottle of root beer every-other 
day. I pretty much have forgotten about the constant pop thing. I 
occasionally crave a coke, or a root beer, but on those days I either 
give in, and end up not drinking the whole thing, or say &quot;you've got x 

more days until Saturday&quot; when I usually allow myself one. It's not 

THAT bad is what I'm getting at...At least for me.
I too don't like coffee or tea, I drink water, lots of it, then milk for 

dinner. I used to do the water bottle thing, but I realized I was 
creating a lot of extra garbage, and spending a lot of money I didn't 
need to on them. I bought a water filter (I really like water when it's 

filtered) and a bottle that's got a twist on cap that's connected to the 

bottle. I fill it up every morning, it lasts me half the day, then I 
fill it up for lunch at a fountain at work. I'm drinking two liters a 
day, I dont' know how much you're supposed to drink, but I'm sure I'm 
above that..And it's great. Milk I take the money I'm saving on food, 
and have Oberweis delivered to me (for those of you who don't have that 

offered to you, it's a higher quality milk, and I can really taste the 

difference when I step back down to a generic milk). 
As for tips for not doing the grab and run, I'm still trying to figure 

some of that out...I tend to work 60+ hours a week, and do much grabbing 

and running. Though, I do have the benefit of being as single as they 
come. :)
Anyway, welcome and good luck!

&gt;I found this through your shovelglove website. I did
&gt;a search for &quot;how to use a sledgehammer&quot; and your site
&gt;was staring at me. I recently became acquainted with
&gt;my sledgehammer because we had to break up the stone
&gt;path out back. It was quite fun but lots of hard work.
&gt;Especially for me. The sledge is moving to my bedroom
&gt;Sunday night. I do love the way it feels so that is a
&gt;good starter for me. 
&gt;
&gt;I am also starting NoS tomorrow. The soda is going to
&gt;be the worst for me. I've tried to break the habit,
&gt;but I don't like coffee or tea.. so far I've not found
&gt;a replacement for my habit. I started a new job and
&gt;I'm the fattest person there. I really feel like I
&gt;stand out. This is the most I've ever weighed. I'm
&gt;starting with baby steps. If I can lose a lb a week
&gt;I'll be happy. It's weight coming off, not going on
&gt;that counts. I like the idea of a food diary. I have a
&gt;small notebook so I can write down everything that
&gt;goes in my mouth. Snacks are my downfall also. But
&gt;that will be easier to stop than soda. I have my water
&gt;bottle ready for work tomorrow. 
&gt;
&gt;Any tips for working moms? I'm working on organizing
&gt;my day/time better so that I'll have more time for sit
&gt;down meals (three a day) instead of grabbing something
&gt;and going.. which leads to bad bad snacking while out.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for reading this far!
