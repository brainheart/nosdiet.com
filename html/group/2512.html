Well, welcome to the group. All I can say is, this stuff really does
work. I started a little more than a year ago, and I'm down overall
about 17 lbs. And I know wear a Large size polo-shirt (used to be
XL)... granted, I think manufacturers are making the sizes bigger than
what they used to be.. but still... ;)

The toughest &quot;S&quot; would for me would be a toss-up between snacks 
and
sweets. Snacking was just a bad habit... I'd have something to &quot;tide&quot;
me over until a meal... but it was just extra food. If I time my
meals right and eat a decent breakfast, the snacking problem went
away. (It also helps not to carry any change or $1 bills... lest I
give in to the temptation of the vending machines nearby!) Sweets
still are, and always will be, difficult. Although now I have a
&quot;tradition&quot; of having chocolate of some form for breakfast on
Saturdays, so having that to look forward to makes it easier to get
through the rest of the week.

As far as showing support, the best advice I can probably give is..
have patience! If you're like me, it took a lifetime of not-so-great
eating habits to put on the weight, and it will take time for it to
come off. The good thing is, the results are long term... with good
habits, the weight will stay off, and you'll be healthier.

So... don't be like those people that join the gym in January and are
gone by March. Stick with it, and you will be glad you did!

&gt; Hi, my name is Debby. I'm 25 years old, and in need of a diet. I've 

&gt; made it a new years resolution of mine to lose weight. And I know 

&gt; that it would be a lot easier if I had some help. I need support. 

&gt; I'm willing to give it a try if I know that there are people out 
&gt; there who are interested in helping and showing support. Hopefully 

&gt; I'll be welcome to this group with open arms and open minds. :)
&gt;
