Hi Brooke,

I don't measure, but I paid attention to what I was
doing today a little bit. Here goes:

Roughly:

3 handfuls rolled oats
1 handful dried fruit
1 handful nuts
1 handful seeds
Hot water on top

It's pretty caloric, but not a whole lot. When I
started my oatmeal kick, my portions were sickeningly
large. The stuff is like cement, it fills. Not a large
amount will do the job. Too much can turn you off to
oatmeal completely. That being said, you don't want to
undershoot and then be raging for snacks afterword.
I'd recommend make plenty and adjust downward. If you
feel like &quot;I never want to eat oatmeal again!&quot; after
your portion, you probably just made too much. Keep
that in mind and don't blame the oatmeal: just make a
little less next time. I'd recommend doing it by eye
rather than by measuring, because you're right,
measuring is horrible and you won't do it long term.
It'll take some time to get it right, but it's worth
it.

&gt; To those of us who are having oatmeal for breakfast,
&gt; How much should one be 
&gt; having at each serving? I hate to have to start
&gt; measuring and all.. Also, I 
&gt; have started putting in the flavored creamer for a
&gt; little different taste 
&gt; rather than the sweetener or sugar substitute. It
&gt; really is very good..
&gt; Thanks,
