&gt; But do be careful not to overload
&gt; yourself by taking on too many new things at once. I
&gt; didn't (not by plan, but just because I didn't think
&gt; of them all at once). If you find you are running into
&gt; difficultly, you may want to stagger your starts a
&gt; bit.

Thanx Reinhard for the welcome. I will be careful not starting too
many things at the same time. My current plan is NoS and UR (alongwith
my exercise plan). Slowly but surely, I will add SG to that. Not in
the near future though.
&gt; 

&gt; You're doing the right thing. Develop the habit first.
&gt; Once you have that down you have a rock to build on.
&gt; It's much, much easier to address the problem of too
&gt; big portions once you have them down to a limited
&gt; number. As I've mentioned in the past, I found that
&gt; part so easy that I never even had to get systematic
&gt; about it.
&gt; 
I agree on developing the habit. To be honest, I will not be surprised
if I initially put on a few pounds while I get the portions right. I
am looking at it in the long run (a permanent lifestyle change).

&gt; 
&gt; Consistency is the key. Your exercise systems sound
&gt; pretty hard core, which is great, but I think what you
&gt; do is much less important than the fact that you do it
&gt; regularly. I'm sure you know this, just a friendly
&gt; reminder.
&gt; 
Thanx for the reminder. :-) I agree - it is more important to do it
regularly than doing all these &quot;GREAT&quot; methods irregularly. I will 
be
aiming for that consistency this year (one of my new year resolutions).

My S days were pretty good. I did have 3 square meals on both days.
After Sat's. dinner I had a piece of brownie (again home-baked). After
Sun's. dinner I had some goooood chocolate truffles, and a 2 pieces of
milk chocolate with almonds. All in all I satisfied my sweet cravings
and am ready to continue the NoS this week. 

Had a decent breakfast (2 eggs, slice of bread and cheese and half an
apple) today and am doing extremely good so far. No hunger pangs.

Reinhard, had a couple of questions:
My general schedule is: 
1. Wake up, have tea (includes splash of half-and-half + splenda) and
then exercise on the bike.
2. After my shower I have my breakfast. At this time, I have either a
cup of coffee or tea (same additions).
Q1: Having tea before exercising - does this go against the NoS grain?
(kind of a snack?)

I generally exercise (weight train) on MWF in the evenings - after
work - around 6-7pm; and then I have my dinner.
Q2: Would having a protein shake pre-workout constitute a snack? Based
on the basic NoS rules, that would be a yes. So, this begs another
question - how can I sustain the high weights if there is a long gap
between lunch and dinner?
Hope these Q make sense.

Thanx,
Mahesh
