I haven't seen that movie, but many of my doggy friends have and thought 
it
hilarious.I have never been to an American dog show, but Americans who 
have
been to both tell me ours are different.

&gt; --- ...Hey Hana, hope you don't mind... I lifted that &quot;tyranny&quot; 
word
&gt; out and used it in one of my Shovelglove posts...See, the British
&gt; use of English is oh so flavorful! :) Yes scales are definitely
&gt; tyrranical! But mine isn't anymore! Hee hee hee :) Sucker! LOL

&gt; &gt;I belong to an internet group of Italian greyhound people. I

&gt; &gt; Hana
&gt; ......Wow, I have heard of this interesting and unusual phenomenon,
&gt; where the dogs and the owners begin to look alike! But so far you
&gt; are the first person I have known to openly admit wanting to look
&gt; like one :) LOL Well that just shows your pure love for the
&gt; puppies :)
&gt; Did you ever see a movie called &quot;Best in Show&quot;? It was a film 
by
&gt; the director/actor Christopher (oops can't remember his last name,
&gt; someone help, my brain cells are diminishing as we speak!) somebody-
&gt; or-other, who also directed and starred in my beloved &quot;Spinal 
Tap&quot;
&gt; and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; all parodies, and what he would
&gt; call &quot;mockumentaries&quot;... Well you can guess what &quot;Best in 
Show&quot;
&gt; mocks (of course, in a lovingly way)
&gt; Dog Shows, and their Dog crazed owners... It is hillarious and I
&gt; recommend it for a night of, very silly, but very enjoyable laughs
&gt; on this subject. If you see no humor in it, then that is a sign
&gt; that you are truly a hard core person who takes animals more
&gt; seriously than most :) Let me know if you ever check it out or have
&gt; seen it already...Bonnie, I bet you liked this one :)!

&gt; &gt;I always recite my own &quot;mantra&quot; before doing that: &quot;The

&gt;
&gt; .....Yes my grasshopper friend Diane, I too used to try an fool
&gt; myself into believing that mantra too, but it didn't work... I find
&gt; the highly spirtual mantra:
&gt; &quot;AAAAAhhhhhhh! Die! You scum sucking scale, Die!&quot; highly 
more
&gt; effective :)
&gt;
&gt; But the important thing is the NoS stickers I have put on every
&gt; weekday this month.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Diane
&gt; ....Wow Sheats, that is a great bit of good news, and more than I
&gt; can say for myself... I think I am going through a rebel against
&gt; everything phase this month? The diet is going basically well, so 
I
&gt; am not upset at all... Infact, in the absence of my dreadfully
&gt; departed (I wasn't going to call it &quot;dear&quot;) scale, I measured 
myself
&gt; this am, feeling pretty slim in the waistline, and it said I took
&gt; off another 1/4 inch... These will add up folks! Before you know it
&gt; I will be accruing many inches lost, because I really want it bad!
&gt; Love,
