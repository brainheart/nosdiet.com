&gt; HI Debbie, So sorry to hear about Richard, You are so right about 

boys, even though mine is 43. His nickname is Murphy( seriously)He 
could get hurt sleeping. We laugh about it and i pray for his safety 
everyday.You cant tell them not to do something at least until their 
doddering.Dinner at Carrabaas was wonderful. Filled up very quickly 
on the Calamari and Minestroni.So was not able to eat much of the 
entree. will eat it today for lunch.My DH drank too much at dinner 
so had to drive him home. Thats a first for sure.He to his credit 
didnt argue. I told him that part of being an adult is knowing your 
limitations and besides I didn feel like dying that night. Took him 
home tucked him in and he didnt remember a thing. LOL Boys act like 
such fools when they get hurt- first they scream and yelp then act 
all tough, then they act like a big baby when they get worse. I 
could type two pages of all of the accidents Murphy has been in, in 
21 years of marriage. Of course all of it made me suffer along with 
him. Well i weighed in at Publix and about fell off the scale in 
shock, i had no idea i weighed that much and it was quite depressing 
and i wished i had never gotten on it. You would think on an S day i 
would have just lost it but the only sweet thing i had was 2 
caramels and that was it. Two meals no snacks.It bummed me out all 
weekend. So i have about 40# to lose, to be at a good weight for my 
height. We did walk Sat. night about 45 min.My hip hurt so bad, i 
could barely do it and immediately took a pain pill and laid down.So 
the weekend was a bit of a bummer for me also. Love Julie
