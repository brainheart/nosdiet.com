I was wondering something on the same lines.....we are old fashioned German
farmers,
and we actually have 4 meals and no snacks. (So I don't have problem with
not snacking, 
but being older, I can not have 4 meals or I will be the size of the barn!) 

We have breakfast, 
supper, and dinner. And then at around 10 in the morning, there is a lunch.
For my youngest
son, he has a lunch at 8:30 in the evening....but that is special
circumstances. And it gives him
a chance to have things he would not have during our regular meals, like 
a
bowl of cold cereal
or a sweet like a cookie or donut. 

I imagine also, that what is used as &quot;snacks&quot; is something we do not 
even
have around
the house because we are full from actual meals. And our meals are way
different then
what is served at even the local schools. My children have a hard time
having a meal
there for the &quot;lunch&quot; because it is foods we don't even consider eating, 
or
would only have
once a year at the house (like pizza). 

I am told that a lot of those foods are things they serve all the time 
at
restaurants, and on 
kid's menus....but I am not real familiar with that. I don't consider it a 

real food&quot;. 

just my two cents....

You could adopt an old fashioned English meal called &quot;afternoon tea&quot;.It's
eaten at about 4 to 5 o'clock. Traditionally it consists of slim sandwiches
and a piece of fruitbread or fruitcake and cups of tea. It acts as a &quot;bridge
between early lunch and late dinner and is definitely a meal.

&gt; &gt; I have been eating out of control and last night I
&gt; &gt; had all kinmds of
&gt; &gt; nightmares where I had no control of things and was
&gt; &gt; crying and screaming in
&gt; &gt; my sleep. I had better get a grip on things!

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Reinhard is so right about how good it feels to not
&gt; &gt; snack. To resist gives
&gt; &gt; such a feeling of pride. Even though no one else in
&gt; &gt; the room notices. LOL
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What I have been telling myself, if this is useful
&gt; &gt; information to anyone, is
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;you tasted that before, you don't need to taste it
&gt; &gt; again, and an
&gt; &gt; opportunity to taste it again will come around at
&gt; &gt; some point in your life&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This self talk seems to get me through my weak
&gt; &gt; moments. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For example: chips. I have consumed enough of
&gt; &gt; those to know what the taste
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; is long after I pass over to the other side. And
&gt; &gt; when the chance to have
&gt; &gt; them comes about, like a dinner buffet at a picnic,
&gt; &gt; I find it easy to resist
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; them again as I make good food choices.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And what can be fun about the good food choices is
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &quot;I have not tasted this before....what a treat!&quot;
&gt; &gt; LOL
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, to all.......have a great noSdietday!
&gt; &gt;
