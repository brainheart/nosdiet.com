Hi deb, that was hysterical. I can just imagine him. What would of 
been interesting is to tape it, and show it to him later so he could 
see how he was acting.I used to work for a pediatrician and he was 
forever saying that it didnt really affect kids. I told him he was 
so wrong, he just didnt give his kids any sugar.When we owned the 
ice cream shop it didnt take long for the sugar to kick in on the 
kids and we would have to scrape them off the ceiling and walls 
(them and the ice ceam )LOL I had nearly suggested letting him eat 
it all and get it over with but it seemed cruel to you:)!!My d.h and 
i are going to start walking tonight, the weather is starting to 
turn cooler, so we wont die out there nor will we be carried away by 
the killer mosquitoes(of which dh is fiercely afraid of)Well yeah 
its time for lunch and I AM HUNGRY.Working hard today. JOOLS
