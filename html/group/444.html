I also have a
&gt; family to take care of so I pretty much come last and time to myself
&gt; is a very rare occurrence.

Oh Saleta, How I can relate :)

My mornings are starting at 5 am right now. I get my hubby up, we go out
to the barn, milk and feed 8 does, haul out hot water by hand to the
milkers, chickens, rabbits, bucks, and dogs. Feed the horses and back
inside with the milk. DH gets ready and off to work by 7. I strain milk
and pastuerize, and get the milk ready to bottle feed 16 kids. Feed kids,
clean up all the buckets and milking machine from the morning. During all
this I get the oldest dd up and off on the school bus. Youngest usually
gets up about the time I am cleaning the kitchen, so then I get to feed 
her
too and start on all the usual house stuff. Feed kids again at noon. Clean
up buckets again.

I do transcription work, so at some point during the day I likely will 
have
a job assigned. Try to get that set up to go and by then it is likely time
to start milking and chores again. Feed kids again. Clean buckets and
milkers.
Dinner and clean up. Then I may end up typing till midnight.

I am tired &lt;g&gt; Although I am moving all day I am still not getting 
that
good sweaty exercise in.....oh wait -- I had to chase a loose buck down 
the
other day, so that counts I guess. LOL. In full winter garb I did sweat.
Perhaps dragging said 200 lb buck back to pen counts as &quot;resistance&quot;
training? :)

I am getting a bit discouraged right now that I just don't have actual 
work
out time. Maybe this will improve as the days get longer too. It was -15
F degrees when we were milking this morning. I hope spring gets here
soon....

Tracy
