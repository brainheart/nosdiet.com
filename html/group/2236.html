i did good i read not to skip meals on thanksgiving so i did not
we lost our power for the day so i had to go cook over at a friends house 

that also helped with no snacking as there was nothing to snack on 
i ate and cleaned up and packed the food away we did not even have dessert other than 
some fresh fruit salad as we were all too full .. and the only thing left over was 
turkey and green beans so that has been what i have eaten for dinner the past few 
days 
so i did not even gain a pound from the holiday that felt good

&gt; Thanks Reinahrd, I needed that reminder, very eloquently spoken I 

might add. We love hearing from you in slow bandwith country. 
Personally we are in DSL land and lovin it. I looked at the pie 
plate this am and thought to mself that it will be spoiled by 
Saturday. Oh well. There will always be pie in my future 
somewhere.Anyways thanks again. Julie

&gt; As planned, I overate on Thanksgivings. No regrets, it
&gt; was great. If you did the same, great, don't worry
&gt; about it. That's the time for it.
&gt; 
&gt; But I notice that some of you seem to have a very
&gt; liberal concept of the boundaries of thanksgivings.
&gt; It's one day. Not Wednesday, not Friday, not 10 days,
&gt; just Thursday. Leftovers? They meal up very well.
&gt; Turkey sandwiches for lunch, microwaved plates for
&gt; dinner, etc. If you still have any appetite left on
&gt; Friday, that should do the trick nicely. Sweet
&gt; leftovers? Believe it or not, they'll keep one day
&gt; till the weekend. And if the velociraptors you live
&gt; with get to it first, good riddance. The fridge can be
&gt; your friend.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I should have posted this sooner to prop up
&gt; the stumbling, but I was in slow bandwidth country.
&gt; 
&gt; This system isn't going to work if you turn every
&gt; major holiday into a two week affair. I don't want to
&gt; pounce on the already humbled, but I don't want to
&gt; &quot;OK&quot; you into complacency either. If you messed up,
&gt; recognize it, learn from it. Don't start starving
&gt; yourself to compensate, that's a recipe for utter
&gt; disaster. Just abide by the regular N day rules, no
&gt; more, no less. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most of us in this group, there are two other
&gt; biggies right around the corner that need to be
&gt; prepared for, and they're close enough together that
&gt; the temptation to extend and merge will be even
&gt; stronger. Apply your Thanksgivings day lessons to
&gt; these. Give yourself these 2 days wholeheartedly, but
&gt; no more.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes and much gratitude for this great group,
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. Bad as it is, let's be thankful that our problem
&gt; is getting too much food and not the other way around.
&gt; As problems go, it's a much better problem to have. Of
&gt; the 106 billion or so people who have ever lived on
&gt; earth, precious few have been so lucky.
