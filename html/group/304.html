Hi no1space,

I've stuck my responses by your questions/observations
below.

Reinhard

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been browsing this group for about 5 days,
&gt; gathered my 
&gt; thoughts, and decided to post everything I had for
&gt; now all at the 
&gt; same time.... more efficient, right?

yes! very admirable. Welcome.

&gt; 
&gt; So in no particular order, here we go:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Reinhard- since you say you eat a lot of oatmeal
&gt; because it's 
&gt; portable and easy, what kind of oatmeal is it? I
&gt; would assume that 
&gt; it's not the &quot;instant&quot; kind (less healthy). So, I
&gt; guess I wonder how 
&gt; the fully cooked type is considered portable. 
&gt; 

It takes me about 2 minutes to prepare my oatmeal
lunch. I don't use pre-cooked instant oats, but
regular, old-fashioned rolled oats. I like my oatmeal
chewy, so just pouring hot water over them from the
spigot at work and letting it sit for a minute cooks
them just fine for my taste. I guess it winds up
eating more like Musli than traditional oatmeal. It's
not quite raw, but close. I used to buy &quot;Old Wessex
Brand Scottish Oats&quot; which lives up to it's billing as
&quot;Chewy * Chewy * Chewy.&quot; Some other other brands I'd
tried were too mushy for my taste even though I hardly
cook them at all. I now buy from the bulk bins at my
local supermarket, since I've discovered they're just
as good (and cheaper). As I posted previously, I try
to always include nuts of somekind, dried fruit of
some kind, and seeds of some kind, alternating the
varieties as I run out to keep from getting bored. Not
low calorie, but filling as cement, reasonably
healthy, and I do actually enjoy it.

On weekends I'll sometimes cook up a batch of the
super hard core steel cut oats. That takes about half
an hour, but is worth it when you have time. Very
tasty, and leftovers reheat well. 

&gt; 2. Do beverages count as anything? Water, tea,
&gt; coffee and other no-
&gt; cal drinks, can they be consumed throughout the day
&gt; without being 
&gt; considered snacks? Or must they only be consumed
&gt; along with one of 
&gt; the meals?

I have no rule about beverages, except to count the
really sugary ones as esses. Drink as many no calorie
drinks (especially water) as you possibly can. It's
important to stay hydrated, and it wards off hunger.

&gt; 3. Regarding the 3 meals a day concept- I get it;
&gt; but- don't you 
&gt; agree there is something to be said for the 6 small
&gt; meals a day plan 
&gt; since blood sugar stays level and hunger pangs are
&gt; not as likely to 
&gt; occur? Does a plan like that readily fit into the
&gt; nosdiet?

There are 2 things to be said about the 6 (or
whatever) small meals a day plan:

1) It works in the lab. People who eat many small
meals a day do metabolize them more efficiently.

2) It doesn't tend work in nature. Metabolize as they
might, people who eat many small meals instead of the
traditional three usually wind up eating a lot more.

See:

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#graze">http://www.nosdiet.com/#graze</a>

For more on this.

If you're still convinced that you need more meals and
can pull this off, it's ok with me if you do a
modified nosdiet with more meals (just decide what
your magic number is up front, and don't blame me if
it doesn't work!). 

&gt; 
&gt; 4. Reinhard- do you have any before/after pictures
&gt; of yourself? Do 
&gt; you have any pictures showing your upper body which
&gt; show the effects 
&gt; of the shovelglove exercises, and/or pics which may
&gt; depict the loss 
&gt; of fat or flab?

I have some &quot;after&quot; pictures and videos at the
shovelglove site, but they're more so you can see the
movements and not close ups to admire my manly biceps.
I guess I should put something up... it feels a little
weird and exhibitionistic... but I understand why it
might be helful. With the before photos it's tough to
find something pathetic enough to get people excited
about the transformation but not so pathetic that my
wife is tempted to divorce me... I've got to mull this
over a bit more. I'll post to the group when/if I put
something up.

&gt; 
&gt; 5. If you do the shovelglove exercises, does this
&gt; completely replace 
&gt; the need for doing situps/crunches on the floor? Or
&gt; do situps feature 
&gt; anything extra that cannot be achieved standing up?
&gt; 

I don't do any exercises on the floor. The shovelglove
movements work my stomach muscles plenty hard. It
makes sense: the reason you have stomach muscles in
the first place is to do stuff like that. Situps and
crunches do not resemble any natural movements I know
of.

&gt; 6. Why do you call it the shovel GLOVE? I understand
&gt; the shovel part, 
&gt; but not the glove part.
&gt; 

The &quot;glove&quot; is the sweater, and the &quot;shovel&quot; is a
sledgehammer. Go figure. It was originally going to be
a custom glove slipped over a weigted shovel, bu then
I hit on the current, simpler design. Somehow the
names I first came up with stuck even after I'd
changed the implementation. 

&gt; 7. Has anybody noticed that the nosdiet is EXACTLY
&gt; the plan (less the 
&gt; s-days) followed by Jared from Subway to lose 245
&gt; lbs. ? He decided 
&gt; to eat an exact quantity of food only 3 times per
&gt; day, with no snacks 
&gt; in-between ever, lots of walking, water, and outside
&gt; of his meals, no 
&gt; other food crossed his lips. There was no sugar in
&gt; any of his chosen 
&gt; foods, and he still had lots of BREAD everyday,
&gt; contrary to the no-
&gt; carb preachers. That tells me the system is sound.

I didn't know that. For some incomprehensible reason
the subway commercials tend not to empahsize that
part... I'm happy to hear it.
