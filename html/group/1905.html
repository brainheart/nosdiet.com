&gt;my kids love vegetables they even fight over who gets the last serving 
i
usually have to make DS his own bowl because he will eat the whole thing.
ever since he was a kid when he was a baby he would bring me a can out 
of
the cupboard and ask me to open it. i was very lucky because they got a 
hot
meal at day care including vegetables and they learned to eat them and 
enjoy
them i am always shocked when their friends come here and refuse to eat
vegetables .my kids stare at them like they are weird.. but they only eat
junk food or maybe meat and potatoes what kind of home did they come from
where there were no fruits and vegetables i wonder.. .. mine usually do 
not
eat school lunches they are starved when they get home but i would rather
they pass up food they dont approve of...

Wow, finally, another family like mine!! I was the eldest of seven and we 

all loved vegetables. But our parents didn't send out those little 
&quot;uncertainty vibes&quot; to give us any suspicions about them. =) I see parents 

doing this all the time... Susie already has meat and potatoes on her plate 

and they say, &quot;Susie, would you like some...peas...sweetie?....?&quot; The doubt 

is there, behind their voices, and you better believe that every kid's radar 

will pick it up! LOL (but sad)

One time I was at lunch with coworkers and we were chatting about this, and 

one guy almost fainted when he heard that all the little kids in our family 

had loved vegetables. He said that was the clincher--he had already thought 

we were weird but now he was sure! Now that I've been around other families 

a bit more, I do think it's funny that not only did ours love beans, corn, 

peas and carrots; they thought broccoli, spinach, lima beans and Brussels 

sprouts were fantastic! Brussels sprouts were introduced as Dad's favorite 

vegetable, so of course they were going to be everyone's favorite...along 

with Dad's favorite salad dressing (bleu cheese) and Dad's favorite (only) 

soft drink (root beer).

Be prepared to be an idol, new dad Reinhard!
