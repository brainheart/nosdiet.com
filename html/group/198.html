Hi Lola,

I'm pretty much just going to reiterate Dan's
excellent advice.

1) Realize that this is long term and adjust your
expectations accordingly. Dig in and be patient.

2) The stricter you are up front, the easier it gets
thereafter. Building the habits is hard, but once
they're built they carry you along.

3) Do whatever it takes in the beginning to meet the
literal rules (example: don't begrudge yourself large
firsts so you aren't tempted to snack). Once you have
those down you can worry about &quot;spirit of the law&quot;
fine tuning.

4) If you screw up (and you will, at some point),
don't beat yourself up too much and try to make up for
it with extra deprivations. Self-revenge is briefly
emotionally satisfying, but doesn't work in the long
run. Just acknowledge that you screwed up, shake it
off, and keep trying as if nothing happened.

5) If you don't already, you have to start moving. If
the word &quot;exercise&quot; sends chills down your spine, just
start walking (see <a href="http://www.urbanranger.com">http://www.urbanranger.com</a> 
for
additional inspiration). It's so important to do
*something*. Don't worry about qualifying for the
olympics just yet. To recycle a phrase from
philosopher Leo Strauss on American democracy, &quot;build
low, but on firm ground.&quot;

6) Be sure to keep plenty of &quot;liquid nothing&quot; around,
i.e., water. I just got another email yesterday
reminding me of this. Sometimes the body confuses
thirst with hunger, and often your mind just wants an
excuse for a break and some ritualistic hand mouth
interaction. Water does the trick nicely. If water
bores you, stick a lemon or lime in it to jazz it up
or try tea. See my hierarchy of things to stick in
your mouth at:

<a href="http://nosdiet.com/group/121">http://nosdiet.com/group/121</a>

As for the low starch diets, my issue isn't that
they're not theoretically effective in some abstract
biochemical sense (perhaps), but that human beings who
enjoy eating (i.e., fat people) are never in a million
years going to stick with one for an extended period
of time. If you're an exception, good for you, but I'm
not, and therefore I can't with a good conscience
recommend it.

I do just fine with the definition of S days on the
site. Naturally you'd lose more weight faster if you
could stick with just one, but I'm worried that that's
not enough carrot and too much stick for most people
(including me).

I love Dan's bet idea, and, as he mentioned, do at
least keep us posted and bug us whenever something
comes up.

Good luck!

Reinhard
