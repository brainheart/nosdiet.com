Well this is both an admission of guilt and also a bit of good stuff 
too.... Last night I was a complete basket case of total 
sadness....Crying crying crying crying and then more crying....
It's past now, but I did go and get a Haagen Daz Chocolate bar...
I'm not too bent out of shape about it though because over the 
weekend I didn't have one good S, so it's kindof like a delayed S 
from last week... But mainly it just hit the spot and well it was 
unscheduled and I didn't need a prescription...
Today however, I went to work and now that I am in an office 
setting, I finally got a chance to experience that terrible 
temptation when people bring in a case of donuts and coffee... &quot;Want 

one?&quot;, &quot;Have one come on!&quot; &quot;Sure you don't want one?&quot; were 
common 
remarks... And I was very very hungry today since all I had for 
breakfast was a banana and two cups of coffee... But, tada! I didn't 
eat one... I came reallllly close though at around 12 when my 
stomach alarm started ringing, but as I headed towards the 
sugariciuous pastries I did a 180 and hit the water cooler instead!
So I am real proud of myself!
I hope they don't bring them in too many times a week though, as 
that is just torture when you have it laying right in front of you!
Peace and Love,
Debbie :)
