Hi Lee,

You wrote:

&gt;&gt;I know exactly how you feel. It is so hard. I have been trying 
since=20
&gt;&gt;March and these last few weeks have finally stuck so just keep 
trying.

This really helps. I know that when one is trying to break a habit/develop=
=20
a new habit, it is common to have many false starts before the new habit=20
finally =93clicks.=94 So I=92m going to keep trying.

&gt;&gt;What seemed to help me the most is forgetting about having the 
healthiest=
=20
&gt;&gt;food on my plate and making sure it was full. This seemed to keep me 
fro=
m=20
&gt;&gt;starving until the next meal. I tried not to feel guilty because I 
was=20
&gt;&gt;not having broiled fish and green vegetables. I was just trying to 
stick=
=20
&gt;&gt;to a pattern.

This makes sense. I notice that whenever I try to restrain my portions 
(ea=
t=20
less than a full plate) or try to make my meal healthy, I feel dissatisfied=
,=20
which usually results in an S behavior. But when I make sure I put enough=
=20
on my plate to fill me up, and stop worrying about eating healthy but make=
=20
sure I eat what I like, I get more pleasure out of the meal and can stop=20
thinking about food until it=92s time to eat again.

Duh! If I know all this, why don=92t I just stick to it, huh?

&gt;&gt;Trying to change a habit was my first goal and still is=85.Trying to 
undo=
=20
&gt;&gt;many years of bad habits can't happen over night..

I agree. What I need to do first is just concentrate on getting from one=20
meal to the next without indulging in any S behaviors. I=92m making this 
m=
y=20
immediate goal for today.

Thanks Lee!

Valerie
