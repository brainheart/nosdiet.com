If you want to cozy up in front of the tv, take a nice hot bath, put on
your favorites, grab that blanket, and cozy up in front of the tv MINUS
the bag of chips. How about a cup of tea, or broth? 

Strong cravings? I work it into my NoSlivingplan. If I don't think I will
live one more moment without my bowl of vegetable soup with cornbread, 
then
that is what I have for that meal. Even if it means I have cooked a meal
for my family and a different one for me. One of my loves is the
egg/bacon/toast/grits breakfast. I make it. A small egg, 2 bacon, 1 toast,
grits.....no butter.....and I eat about 2 or 3 bites of each food so that 
I
have tasted it, I put the rest in the dog dish, and finish my coffee. 

I have a real issue with the eggs because we eat duck and goose eggs all
summer, the hardest time of the year to lose weight, btw, and now when 
they
are not laying, I have to buy chicken eggs at the farmers market. So I 
buy
their smallest eggs....smaller then what you can get in a grocers, and 
that
saves me tons of calories but gives me the egg taste. Not as good as my
bird's eggs during the summer, but like 300 calories less! and at least 
I
get my egg. 

I love this time of year....Oct to end of Feb. Easiest time of the year 
to
stick to a food plan that will lose weight. I was darn lucky with this 
NoS
to maintain my weight over the summer. I lost 40 pounds in Feb and March...
...maintained, and now that it is fall again, I dropped another 3 pounds. 

By the end of the year, I should have another bunch off! 

Hang in there....you'll figure out what works for you.

Kate

thanks guys for telling me what you do with s days, it really helps ( to 
get

me out of denial ! 
i like the one snack and one sweet per s day suggestion best, that sounds 

like good sense to me.today is day 5 for me, and today has not been a
perfect day 
for me..i have eaten some sugar and i am really fighting the urge to say
@!$% 
it ! and cozy up in front of the tv with a bag of salt &amp; vinegar chips...i 

just keep telling myself not to make a minor indescretion a full fledged
binge. 
how do you guys deal with insanely stong cravings to eat?
thanks again ! donna o
