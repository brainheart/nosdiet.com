&gt; HI Sunshine, my name is Julie and I live in the &quot;Sunshine State&quot; 

or Hurricane State depending on the month.:) I just had to respond 
to your post. The only hunger fullness diet i have been on is &quot;Weigh 

Down&quot; by Gwen Shamblin. That was basically the premise of the book, 

that. As long as i was a part of the local support group( going on a 
regular basis it seemed to work for me, but like many others and the 
boiled frog syndrome, hunger crept up on me and before i knew it i 
was eating and snacking and never hungry, but always eating. I have 
said before that it feels wonderful to go to bed hungry. In fact i 
get nauseous at this point in the diet watching my DH eat late at 
night.No temptation at all.Nos isnt quick loss buts its steady, and 
its habit forming.My 18 yo daughter learned to eat that way when i 
was on the diet, she must have been about 9 or 10 can't remember 
now. She is still to this day, pencil thin with no food hang ups. Of 
course she is just 18, with no kids on her hips yet.LOL. Glad you 
are posting, welcome to our wacky, crazy group Julie
&gt; 
&gt; Hi everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I usually am a lurker, but have decided to come out of lurk-dome 
to 
&gt; ask a question that has been bothering me for some time about 
hunger 
&gt; and fullness approaches to eating. BTW, I have had success using 
the 
&gt; No-S plan, and am convinced it is the most sane approach to eating 

&gt; out there!
&gt; 
&gt; There are some plans that advocate no calorie counting, portion 
&gt; control, etc., but instead say to rely solely on your own hunger 
and 
&gt; fullness signals to gauge how much you should eat. It sounds 
&gt; logical. Most of these plans state that we are born with the 
innate 
&gt; ability to know when and how much we should eat (usually using the 

&gt; newborn's demand feeding schedule as an example of this 
approach). 
&gt; It does sound more doable than most diets, especially the ones 
that 
&gt; require you to keep a journal of each and every thing you put in 
your 
&gt; mouth.
&gt; 
&gt; So why do they work for me at first, then seem to stop working? 
In 
&gt; the past, I would excitedly embrace these plans due to 
the &quot;freedom&quot; 
&gt; aspect they offered--&quot;Forget counting calories, fat, carbs, 
proteins--
&gt; listen to your body! It knows best!&quot; And for a while, they 
worked. 
&gt; But then, I would find that I would start to gain weight when 
&gt; the &quot;hunger&quot; would come more often and the &quot;fullness&quot; took 
longer 
to 
&gt; attain. Once again, something that in theory sounded so simple 
was 
&gt; no longer simple after all.
&gt; 
&gt; Any of you out there have similar experiences with hunger/fullness 

&gt; diets? What are your opinions/insights about them? I would also 
&gt; like to hear Reinhardt's take on why these approaches don't always 

&gt; work for people.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance! : )
