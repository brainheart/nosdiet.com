My little cutie strained a neck muscle, trying to get into some of 
our big banana boxes filled with all our junk from moving...Then he 
dragged one of them up the stairs from the basement, and then up the 
steps to the second floor...Is it an inherently male thing to do 
feats of strength whenever possible? Sorry, I know, sexist talk...
Well I guess it's also a case of &quot;when the cats away the mice will 

play&quot;...He did it while I was out at the office yesterday, and my 

mother was watching him....She tried to tell him to stop, and that 
it was dangerous, but she's not usually the law maker...Grateful me 
is....Spent all day since 9 am with Richard, icing it and enforcing 
the &quot;rest in bed&quot; rule...No kid likes to stay still so this was 

extremely hard... I tried it last night when he first had the 
strain, but noooooooo....he insisted to keep right on 
playing &quot;snood&quot; on the computer and wouldn't let me put ice on 
it...
Then, at the first attempt to move his head this morning he was 
screaming, since it got a good long time to get into full spasm mode.
So he went, begrudgingly along with the first aid regimen...and we 
had to be very very very very very very
bored....And I was pissed off because there was a free bluegrass 
concert at my library with a great mandolin player... oh well, 
Murphy's Law I guess....
So, in an attempt to S during the boring day, I made cook and serve 
pudding...We didn't bother waiting for it to cool.
Tasted like chocolate soup. And it lasted a lot longer than if it 
was cold...then it would have lasted 1 minute.
Unfortunately it didn't help the day much, or my mood.
Cabin fever sucks.
Sorry guys for bitching, you won't hear too many posts like this 
from me again...
Hopefully tomorrow will be nicer :)
Love,
Deb
