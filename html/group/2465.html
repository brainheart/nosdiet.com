&gt; Studies have actually shown that the weight loss is more if the

....Hi Carrie Poersch (I bet you heard your share of racecar jokes 
when you were a kid! LOL :)

Thanks again for the info Carrie.. There may be something to those 3 
servings, but I'm sure that the Dairy Industry is still emphasising 
the selected facts that will help sell milk, not Kombu Seaweed or 
Almonds :)
I looked at the articles you posted and wanted to make a little 
point to add my two cents to your two cents so we would have four 
cents...
The studies were comparing, calicium intake from 3 servings of 
dairy, versus 1 serving of dairy plus an 800mg calcium 
suppliment/pill, and then compared it to a very calcium poor diet...
I believe that the reason their studies point towards the three 
servings theory being the best is twofold.
1. It is obvious that if you eat you will stimulate your metabolism, 
better than if you starve yourself.. So these mini meal, dairy 
additions are good for stimulating your overall ability to turn on 
you inner calorie burner...
2. It isn't widely known, but Calcium can only be absorbed at a 
certain rate... I believe that the most calcium you can absorb in 
one dose is 500 milligrams.... So those 800 milligram 
pills/suppliments are basically throwing 300 milligrams of 
Calcium &quot;down the toilet&quot;.... So even if the calories remain the 

same in the two scenarios, if it's the calcium that makes or breaks 
the difference in the overall burned fat/calories, at the end of the 
day, the 3 servings rule works because it introduces the calcium 
into our systems more efficiently...

&gt;&gt;Personally when I started NoS I would occasionally have a glass of 

chocolate milk with breakfast. For me having that bit of chocolate 
helped me keep from totally binging on chocolate later. 

....Hey if this is actually helping you from going nuts later, then 
by all means please help yourself... If it were *me* I would wind up 
drinking the whole gallon in one day (with help from Richard of 
course!)
Please keep sending the info, I just enjoy picking it all apart 
because it's my nature to do that... It's fun for me, but I don't 
want it to discourage you or anyone from sharing feelings or info or 
science...It's all grist for the mill :)
Peace and Love,
Deb :)
