It's difficult to explain, but the exercises are designed to fatigue 
each muscle group without weights by using isometric movements. 
Don't know if I'm allowed to post sites but just leave the dash out 
of T-tapp and you will find it. They also have a try before you buy 
section at the top with instructions. Can't say that I have had the 
results that were mentioned but I think it's a great plan.

&gt; Hi Beth, I'm coming from the T-Tapp web site too, not only have I 

&gt; fallen from a healthy way of eating, sigh....I've dropped the 
tapping 
&gt; as well. 
&gt; So here we are, a new month and a new year, I'll give it a wirl for 

&gt; three weeks with you, if you would like a partner that is. I 
really 
&gt; can't do much worse than I'm doing now. 
&gt; Hey to everyone else, glad to be a part of the group.

&gt; &gt; Thought I would start out w/an Austin Powers quote, to give you 

&gt; guys 
&gt; &gt; a general idea of what I am like (and to warn you too I suppose 

&gt; LOL).
&gt; &gt; I actually heard of NoS on a t-tapp web site (exercise site that 

I 
&gt; &gt; love) and started reading about it and trying to read all the 

past 
&gt; &gt; posts for this group. However, after several weeks now of reading 

&gt; &gt; posts, I figure that I may never get caught up, so decided to 

start 
&gt; &gt; up here. Today is the first NoS day for me. It has not been bad 

at 
&gt; &gt; all, but that in itself kind of scares me... please tell me this 

&gt; &gt; truly will work for me if I follow the 3 main NoS principles... 

my 
&gt; &gt; head is trying to sabotage me already by telling me it could not 

be 
&gt; &gt; this simple and that instead of losing weight I am going to just 

&gt; gain 
&gt; &gt; even more weight. Of course, I am not doing any other eating 

&gt; program, 
&gt; &gt; so why NOT give it 3 weeks to see what happens? The worst thing 

&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; can happen is a gain more weight- but by not being on any sort of 

&gt; &gt; eating program now I run that risk regardless. 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, hello everyone! Glad to be aboard here!
