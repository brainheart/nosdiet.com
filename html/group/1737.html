&gt; Well its my first day of nos, its almost 9am and for
&gt; whatever reason 
&gt; i am already hungry,

It's probably psychological: you know you've got to
hold out and you're afraid you'll be hunger, so you
start getting anticipatory pangs. I think you'll find
it's not actually that bad. Just make sure, as Lee
warns, to give yourself big enough portions to carry
yourself through. This might mean a bit of excess at
the beginning. That's ok. Proper &quot;mealing&quot; habits are
worth a few extra calories up front. It's an
investment.

&gt;Friday is a great day to start

Yes! Except I find that a lot of newbies get thrown by
the weekends. They can't actually enjoy them yet, they
feel guilty. Better than worrying a whole lot about
eating too much this weekend, you might do better
trying to find something you especially want to eat.
Counterintuitive as this is, I think you'll find you
eat less and enjoy it more.

&gt; this by the way. 
&gt; I am talking to my 13yo daughter about this and
&gt; hoping to convince 
&gt; her to join me. 

The most convincing thing you could do is stick with
it yourself a few weeks. In any case, she'll have to
feel like it's her own initiative. Best of luck to you
both.

&gt; I have
&gt; been pushing thru, not doing the mental reprimand I
&gt; was used to before and it is working. It's been a
&gt; while.. like 3 months maybe? I'm not really keeping
&gt; track. I've lost 12 lbs.

Congratulations! Not doing the mental reprimand may be
the single most important factor. Remember those
decadent, skinny French.

This is beautiful, Lee. Mind if I quote this on the
home page? It's a huge stumbling block for so many
people and I've never managed to put it this
succinctly.
