Cathy, I just wanted to say you are not alone when I found NoS this
year I was around 230 pounds very unhappy, very unhealthy, and feeling
like I was between a rock and a hard place. I thought I couldn't
afford to diet and I couldn't afford not to diet. Here I am, at 219
lbs according to my doctors scale 215 lbs by my home scale, of course
I was wearing my big clunky shoes at the doctors office. At any rate I
have a lot to lose also my goal when I joined NoS is to get down to
125lbs but I would settle to just get down to 150 lbs (what I weighed
ten years ago when I got married). I don't post very regulary, mainly
due to my DH monopolizes the computer, and my kids always call me away
from the computer. I read the daily digest of messages when ever I
get the chance and reply whenever I think I have something to offer. 
You and I both have a long hard road ahead of us. We can do it
together. I am looking forward to becoming a big fat loser on this
diet. If you are feeling weak everyone here is very supportive. 
Don't worry, if you follow the rules, the weight does come off. Even
if you break the rules once in a while. Every body is different, and
loses fat at it's own pace you will have a month when you lose a whole
lot of weight and another when you don't lose any, or you may
consistenly lose small amounts of weight. just keep with it. we will
be here. Good luck. you are not alone. Your friend in health, Melanie

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Oddly enough I discovered the No-S diet through a South Beach diet
&gt; community on Live Journal. While reading over the details of the No-S
&gt; diet I thought &quot;Now here's a plan I could stick to&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; However, I need to lose a lot of weight, about a 100 lbs. I've been
&gt; reading through some posts and I haven't seen any from other people
&gt; who need to lose as much weight as I do. I was wondering if the diet
&gt; works for people like me or if it's geared more towards people who
&gt; only need to drop 10, 20, or 30 lbs. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am just tired of avoiding carbs and counting points. I need to find
&gt; a low maintenance diet where I don't have to deprive myself of my
&gt; favorite foods. 
&gt; 
&gt; -Cathy
