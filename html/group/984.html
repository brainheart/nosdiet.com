I dont know if this msg was for me but anyway...

I dont have a problem with carbs.
The fact is:
I don't need to lose more weight really, and I haven't put weight 
for yrs and I never diet. But I am planning on starting a family 
next year so I want to get fitter. healthier and leaner. so I read 
that a low-carb diet can help lose a lot of body fat (not that I 
have a lot). I wouldn't stop eating carbs as I might get too tired 
specially with my work out routine ( 6 days a week for 1 hour and 
20 minutes aprox - low and high intensity cardio + stretch). I have 
already cut out of my diet chocolates and feel great!! I did that 
because I have no self control over it, I can't buy a bar and just 
have a piece...so I cut the problem from the route (new yrs 
resolution thing)
I still have deserts like cheese cake occasionally, I think last 
time I had some was in May...

The noSdiet gave a different perspective of seeing things, so now I 
eat at the right time which is great, I don't have any snacks or 
sweets. I have breakfast and mid day I will have fruit and yogurt or 
cereal (not very hungry at that time) then at 18:00 I will eat 
again. I feel great and if I get bored I can control myself to not 
snack. I lost 5 kilos this year (January till now ) and now hope to 
just get fitter. I am 1.65 and weigh 55 klg which I think is not 
bad. 
Anyway I am saying too much now...have a great weekend

better with a

manage my

kg. by my

BMI right
&gt; I need to lose about 20 kg. more. My doctor has reduced my 
medication
&gt; already. ( to convert Kg to pounds for non Europeans double the 
pound number
&gt; and add 10% of that figure. 1 kg. is about 2.2 pounds.)

&gt; &gt; Hi Alison
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the idea. One question though. Can we follow Jay Robb
&gt; &gt; diet book without having to buy his products?
&gt; &gt; Thank you
&gt; &gt; Bruxa
