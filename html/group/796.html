Just my two cents regarding breakfast. Eat what sounds good to you
when you wake-up. If you crave something sweet when you wake-up. Find
something like fruit or yogurt. Try pancakes or crepes with yogurt,
yummy. Where did we get this crazy notion that certain foods need to
be served at certain times. I love having bacon and eggs or pancakes
for dinner. I love having Blt's heavy on the lettuce and tomato or
bean burritos, for breakfast. Just make sure you are listening to
what your body is craving. within the NoS rules of course. Do your
best to make choices that best fit what your body really wants. In my
experience, I am less likely to cheat if I eat as close to what my
body wants without going against the rules. -Mel

&gt; &gt; Hello, 
&gt; &gt; Have you thought of adding &quot;splenda&quot; to you tea or coffee. 

&gt; &gt; You can drink sugarless, between meals. Sometimes I enjoy 
&gt; &gt; &quot;diet rite &quot;pop or diet coke, if I cant find the other, 

&gt; pepppermint tea or
&gt; &gt; decaf coffee....I only allow me caffine before breakfast and just 

&gt; a couple
&gt; &gt; of cups as I get the shakes and hypoglycemic with too much 
&gt; caffine. I also
&gt; &gt; get a little shaky with nutrasweet, and try to avoid it as much 

&gt; as possible,
&gt; &gt; using Splenda if needed.

&gt; &gt; My plan is to start full swing tomorrow morning. I have already 

&gt; been 
&gt; &gt; watching my portions and my grazing in the last few weeks but 

&gt; have 
&gt; &gt; not been so as strict as I should. I know I eat more than I 
&gt; should, 
&gt; &gt; mostly through grazing. My meals tend to be small so I will have 

&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; try bigger meals to start off with to curb that need to graze. 

&gt; &gt; Sweets are not really an issue for me. I will be cutting my 
&gt; coffee 
&gt; &gt; and tea intake to try to reduce my sugar intake though as i drink 

&gt; at 
&gt; &gt; least a full pot of both a day (an IV and liquid caffination 

&gt; would 
&gt; &gt; be much simpler no?) 
&gt; &gt; Any words of advice to make it through the first day? Food 
&gt; &gt; suggestions? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;
