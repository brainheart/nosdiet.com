a diatribe against your recent post.

.....I take it as a Diettribe! :) LOL 
I'm glad you clarified what you wrote...It makes more sense to me 
why you chose that word now... I'm just trying to keep things lively 
here! Heh heh :)
Look, you are a computer guy.. You think in fail/success terms... it 
may not be so jarring or depressing to you to think this way... It's 
really just a system of &quot;feedback&quot;... I believe for some people, the 

word failure will actually inspire them to succeed, but for a bunch 
of others, who may already be really sad and in need of a way 
to &quot;cheer themselves on&quot;... setback is helpful, not because of 

inevitable success, as you mentioned, but because it implies that 
one moves on from there and that, they are indeed moving forward...
This may translate as &quot;sticking with it&quot; when they are on a plateau 

or just not making a huge binge out of a minor transgression on 
program....It's meant to be used as an alternative to the 
typical &quot;beating oneself up&quot; when we are not &quot;perfect&quot; 
model...
How about a compromise here? Failure? Black and White. Setback.. 
too mushy and lovey dovey! LOL... How about &quot;on target&quot; or &quot;off 

target&quot;... this, I actually think, is the best way to approach our 

efforts.. It's non judgemental yet accurate...Whaddaya think boss?
Love,
Deb
Have a orange and fuschia day :)
