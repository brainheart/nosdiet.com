Hi Anne,

5 pounds in 3 weeks doesn't sound crazily ambitious,
but keep in mind that pounds are funny things. A pound
of fat weighs just as much as a pound of water, and
much as we'd like to be able to distinguish, it's
tough. Also, unless you are a real featherweight, 5
pounds is light enough that you can probably lose it
by just carefully timing when during the day you step
on the scale. So optimists will have a much easier
time than pessimists.

That said, 5 poundish seems reasonable. Just don't get
too caught up in the one lousy metric we have. And
though three weeks is fine for a test drive, it's long
term that the system really shines.

Welcome and good luck,

Reinhard

&gt; Hi, 
&gt; I'm new to the group and am looking to regain some
&gt; sanity in my relationship 
&gt; with food! Cutting out the snacks and sweets in my
&gt; diet will undoubtedly help 
&gt; me get to a steady and healthy weight if I can pull
&gt; it off consistantly. 
&gt; How much is everyone trying to lose? I have a
&gt; vacation coming up and am 
&gt; hoping to lose at least five pounds of fat (not just
&gt; water!) by then. We leave on 
&gt; Dec. 28th so it's not a lot of time. 
&gt; How much is everyone else trying to lose? Is anyone
&gt; else just trying to eat in 
&gt; a normal and sane way? I find that way too often I
&gt; use food (sweets 
&gt; especially) to deal with emotions so hopefully this
&gt; strategy will lead me to 
&gt; finding alternative ways of coping with stress and
&gt; the like. 
&gt; Good luck to everyone! 
&gt; Anne
