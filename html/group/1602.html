Well, maybe I should clarify my opinions a bit. I don't know what you read 

between my lines, Hana, but it wasn't intended, and I wouldn't want to stir 

up a controversy. You will never find me defending America's many faults, 

and I agree that many (most?) Americans don't understand the rest of the 

world. I grew up overseas and I'm constantly thankful for the benefit of a 

more realistic perspective than most of my friends. I wish Americans in 

general were different, but unless someone actually leaves the country and 

sees the world for himself, it's hard to make people understand.

Apart from that, I was being quite critical of our medical system, though I 

tried to keep it understated. It's a mess. It's unreasonably expensive, 

cumbersome and ineffective. Our third leading cause of death is the medical 

industry. (I've attached the article I'm quoting in case anyone's 
interested.) I am thoroughly disgusted by the ignorance that is allowed to 

flourish in this country. Doctors should be telling their patients how to 

maintain and improve health, not just treating the symptoms of disease. 

Maybe some do try and have to give up, because it's an uphill battle. The 

things that &quot;everyone knows&quot; (mostly false) are just too deeply ingrained. 

But it seems to me that with the incredible amounts of money going to drug 

companies and expensive &quot;treatments&quot; for cancer which don't even offer a 

good chance of survival, there will never be an incentive to find a real 

cure. Personally, I doubt that a &quot;cure,&quot; if found, will be a miracle drug, 

because anything that doesn't aim to augment the body's own natural defenses 

is not addressing the root problem. I believe that cancer treatment 
probably kills more people than cancer.

Now I'm rambling on too long, sorry! Anyway, any cancer patient in this 

country who educates himself about real answers to cancer will probably jump 

on a plane and head to Mexico or Europe. And if researchers in other 
countries make great discoveries (as they already have), those will 
virtually &quot;never&quot; be allowed here. The FDA approval process will drag on 

for so many years and be so hindered by the influence of those filthy-rich 

drug companies that there will be no point in waiting around in America if 

you hope to try it.

So now you know what I really think. =) Sorry it's not really on-topic. I 

see that my original hesitation was warranted, and I'll try to avoid 
controversial nutrition subjects in the future. There are other lists for 

those discussions, after all. But I'm not offended at all and just wanted 

to clarify what I meant.

Diane
