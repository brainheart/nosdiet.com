&gt; HI Jill, You are in the right place girl. This is the easiest i 
have ever had it on a diet and the support is wonderful. For myself 
a sugar addict at heart, i sub with fruit at most meals.I look 
forwward to the weekends, but surprisingly enough i didnt over do it 
my fist weekend just a hand ful of caramels. but here it is thursday 
and i have not had one since sunday night, even though they are on 
the counter. As I have told others, minute by minute then hour by 
hour as you get stronger. I have been on the diet 7 days today and i 
feel wonderful.I feel i have more control over myself and i dont 
feel deprived as most diets make you feel.As far as how you want to 
do this Just follow the plan. no secrets very simple. good lucj to 
you Julie
&gt; 
&gt; Hi. I just found the Nosdiet website while searching for advice 
&gt; on how to get off of sugar. Do most of you abstain from sugar 
&gt; entirely? If so, how did you go off -- just cold turkey? If not, 
do 
&gt; you feel plagued by sugar cravings on the days you don't eat 
&gt; sugar. I'm very much up in the air about how I want to do this. 
&gt; I've been playing around with one system -- but, I'm afraid, 
&gt; playing around is the right phrase. I like the simplicity of this 

&gt; plan, but I think I may need to make the &quot;no sugar&quot; a permanent 

&gt; part of my plan. I'd love to hear about what others of you are 
&gt; doing -- and how you are doing it. Thanks! Jill
