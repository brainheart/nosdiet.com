Hi John,

I'm happy to hear you report that the Japanese are
unconscious no-essers. I read an article in the new
York Times a few months ago that the French also tend
to do something similar (I'd link, but they want
money).

I'm not sure why so many most diets feel they have to
look back to neolithic times to come up with sensible
eating regimens, when recent history and many of our
contemporary neighbor nations would do just fine.
There is no *historical* precedent for a low carb
diet, for example; there couldn't be, it's totally
unsustainable except for the tiniest populations from
the point of view of agriculture. But as you point
out, there is plenty precedent (and contemporary
examples) of people with life styles and mind sets
much like ours (compared to neanderthals) doing
something like no-S.

Even if scientists are right about what &quot;cavemen&quot; ate
(and there is plenty of disagreement on just what that
was) do you really think you can eat like a caveman
without living and thinking like a caveman? Why not
look to the numerous examples that are closer to home?
It's clearer what they are doing and more likely to be
psychologically reproducible.

Sorry to go off on a tangent... Thanks for this
informative post and good luck!

&gt; I stumbled upon the No S Diet while searching
&gt; through Amazon.com 
&gt; yesterday and it really makes sense to me. I lived
&gt; in Japan for a 
&gt; year (a country definitely NOT known for its
&gt; obesity) and I now see 
&gt; that the Japanese actually follow the No S Diet
&gt; quite closely in 
&gt; their eating habits. A typical Japanese eating day
&gt; is as follows: 
&gt; Breakfast consisting of eggs, rice, fish, miso soup,
&gt; coffee. A cup 
&gt; of green tea mid-morning served to everyone at the
&gt; office. A 
&gt; substantial lunch consisting of some kind of meat or
&gt; fish, soup, 
&gt; rice, and vegetables. A cup of green tea
&gt; mid-afternoon again served 
&gt; throughout the office. Dinner consisting of pretty
&gt; much the same 
&gt; thing as lunch. All meals are typically taken with
&gt; plain tea.
&gt; 
&gt; The Japanese are not much for snacking, but very
&gt; often on the 
&gt; weekends they will stop in a coffee shop to have a
&gt; piece of cake and 
&gt; a cup of coffee. Japanese desserts, however, are
&gt; about half as sweet 
&gt; as American desserts.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to start following the No S Diet and I am
&gt; hoping to lose 
&gt; the 20 pounds I gained AFTER returning from Japan!
