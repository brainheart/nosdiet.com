yes i do that also . i save the things that really speak to me during the
week for an S day sometimes like you said the craving passes and sometimes 
i
have it on the S day and say . that really was not very wonderful why did 
i
want it so badly.. but its not like you tell yourself no you cant have 
it
we have an ice cream place here that i have to drive by every day i can
remember long summers thinking i can never have that ice cream it looked
bleak and depressing now i know i could have it on an S day but its just
not worth standing in that long line after all :)

Subject: [nosdiet] Wishlisting Esses

Amazon.com has a feature that allows you to add books
and other merchandise to a long-term &quot;wishlist&quot;
instead of buying immediately. I've found this
wishlist saves me a lot of money because: 

1) I can get other people to buy me the stuff I really
want for birthday, Christmas, etc. 

2) most of the stuff I'm tempted to buy in the heat of
shopping isn't all that tempting when I reconsider it
a week later, but the desire will gnaw at me if I
don't at least acknowledge it in some way.

&quot;Wishlisting&quot; might be a good way to deal with edible
temptations too. If you see something that seems a
real shame not to eat, make a mental note of it. By
acknowledging the desire in this way, you might be
able to get it off your case. The desire is satisfied
because you've let it know that it's going to be taken
care of later (if it's still around). And you'll have
a very nice, well-planned S day to look forward to.
Common temptations are ignored, uncommon temptations
are registered and stored away for future delectation.

Have I done this? Not formally. I haven't written
anything down or used (even to myself) the term
&quot;wishlisting.&quot; But I find it's somehow unconsciously
become my natural response, which is even better. And
with a clear term and concept for it, newbies might
get a jump start.
