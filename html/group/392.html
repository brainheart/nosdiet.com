Jason brought up this issue a few days ago, and now
it's very much on Saleta's mind, so I thought I'd look
a little into what (if anything) science has to say
about this issue.

I'm a little pressed for time at the moment, so I'm
going to have to make do for now with an article I
read yesterday on yahoo news entitled &quot;Study Links
High-Carbs and Weight Loss.&quot; Here's the url: 

<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=534&amp;ncid=534&amp;e=6&amp;u=/ap/20040127/ap_on_he_me/high_carb_diet">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=534&amp;ncid=534&amp;e=6&amp;u=/ap/20040127/ap_on_he_me/high_carb_diet</a>

Yes, you read that right: *high* carbs. But that's not
actually what interests me here. Other studies have
shown the opposite, which makes one wonder how much
all these studies are worth. I'm beginning to think
the telepathic influence of the scientists conducting
the experiment may be the decisive factor. But
whatever their conclusions as far as *what* you should
eat, the studies all seem to agree on *how fast* you
should lose the weight: really slowly. Success in this
study meant an average of 7 pounds over 3 months (11
pounds with exercise). That's not terrible, but not
something you would splash on the cover of a new york
times bestseller. But here's the thing: the
bestsellers are lying. They are lying because people
want to believe this and will pay money to believe it.
Yes, some people do pull it off and lose faster, and
yes, I'm sure a handful of these even manage to keep
it off, just like some people become professional
baseball players. But most people don't. If you go at
a much faster pace than this you are going to burn
out. You are almost certainly doing something that is
unsustainable, either from a willpower or health point
of view or both.

So take heart you slowpokes out there, you're on the
right track.

I'm going to hunt down more articles on this subject
when I get a chance and stick them on the homepage.
It's something I think people need to really have
hammered into them when they start.
