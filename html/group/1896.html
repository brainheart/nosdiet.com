Hi Jen, Diane,

Sensitive taste buds or no, so many overweight people
do wind up viewing food as fuel (calories, carbs,
etc), and find themselves in the worst of both worlds.
They're gluttons on the dusty food of Hades. It's sin
without relish.

With no-s, your conscience will give your taste buds
license to enjoy as never before.

Best to you both,

Reinhard

&gt; &gt;I have a theory that people who have relationship
&gt; issues with food often 
&gt; &gt;have very senstive taste buds, and do enjoy food
&gt; more. I've met people who 
&gt; &gt;are obviously at the other end of the continuum for
&gt; whom food is just a 
&gt; &gt;fuel. They miss out on a lot, but a always skinny.
&gt; 
&gt; That's a pretty good theory, if you ask me. I used
&gt; to have a *very* skinny 
&gt; friend, one of those that would forget to eat all
&gt; day, then finally get 
&gt; hungry and decide what she really wanted to eat,
&gt; then get into the car and 
&gt; drive to town to get it, if it wasn't something in
&gt; the house. Weird.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, one day she was watching me eat
&gt; something and I wondered 
&gt; why she was staring, and she said, &quot;I love to watch
&gt; you eat because I can 
&gt; tell that you *really* enjoy your food!&quot; She said
&gt; it wasn't like that for 
&gt; her. Maybe that's why she had to go in search of
&gt; something extra-special 
&gt; instead of just enjoying what was already in the
&gt; house. It was a little 
&gt; embarrassing at the time she was staring at me, but
&gt; I think this fits your 
&gt; theory.
&gt;
