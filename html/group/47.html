July Web Site Updates

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com">http://www.nosdiet.com</a>

Among other things, I've addressed a bunch of
questions prompted by group members. Nothing we
haven't discussed here, but I thought they deserved
home page billing. Thanks!

New/significantly modified sections include, in order:

*************************************************

*What do you mean by &quot;seconds?&quot; (new)

*Does fake sugar count as an &quot;s&quot;? (new)

*I love the NoSDiet, but my doctor says I need to eat
4/5/6 meals a day because of my medical condition!
(new)

*Are there any NoSDiet recipes? (new)

*This diet actually works! How can I repay you?
(modified, per Google's request)

*If you aren't making any money off this, why are you
advertising? (new)

*Can I buy noSdiet branded merchandise such as
t-shirts, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons,
coffee mugs, plates, calendars, bumper stickers,
business cards, lunchboxes, etc. with the entire diet
(all 14 words) printed on them? (modified)

************************************************

Traffic was way up again in July. For the second month
in a row, the majority of people who ever visited the
site did so this month.

As always, gory details at:

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/lumberjack.html">http://www.nosdiet.com/lumberjack.html</a>

The group's membership also doubled. We're still a
pretty cozy bunch, but that's an encouraging trend. If
we're growing faster than moore's law, I have no right
to complain.

I have to thank google adwords (and the New York Times
bestselling diet that seems to have complained) for
disabling my ads early this month. They were great
sports about the obnoxious email I sent them and my
new ads (and site changes) are even more effective
than the old ones.

Another milestone was that someone actually sent me a
paypal dollar. As she suggested when I told her she
was the first non friend or blood relative to do so, I
think I'm going to have the printout framed and hang
it up on the wall.

Great as these numbers may be, web site hits don't
burn calories, and I hope you're all doing ok in that
regard. On matters nosdiet, I'm buggable any time, so
feel free to email me if you feel the group is too
public for your question.

Reinhard
