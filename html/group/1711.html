&gt; hello everyone... i am fighting a very stong desire to snack right 

now, so i decided to e-mail instead.

Hi Donna :)
Good strategy...get busy with your hands that should help you get 
through that &quot;impulse&quot; period and before you know it you will be at 

your next meal, which you probably are consuming now!
I agree with Reinhard about skipping the coffee, and having a little 
nap and maybe some water...I think coffee is great don't get me 
wrong...I am pretty addicted (and couldn't do black for any money)
but I think you might not necessarily want to be getting wired up 
this late in the day. Plus I think that even though coffee may be a 
temporary appetite suppressant, if you don't have enough water, you 
might get a bit dehydrated because of the diuretic properties of 
coffee, and you might feel even hungrier later (thirst masquerading 
as &quot;hunger&quot;) We all eat out of boredom sometimes and I have been so 

busy with posts these days, like we are talking major excess! LOL, 
they are really taking my mind off in between snacks...
Keep it up and just do the best you can :)
Love,
Deb 
PS I fell of the wagon this afternoon and took Richard and myself 
out for some ice cream &quot;mea culpa, mea culpa, mea haagen daz culpa&quot;
But my friend who I haven't seen in over a month asked me &quot;did you 

lose some weight&quot; I will be replaying *that* comment for at least a 

week! :) Great feeling!
