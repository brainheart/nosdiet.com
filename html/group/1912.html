Hi Donna,

Hang in there. Remember, no self-revenge. You've seen
the enemy, he got the best of you this time, but
you're still here, and you've learned from the
experience. And even now, at your low, you're just 3
weeks from building a new habit. Success is that
close.

Here's an idea: if your work makes lunch timing iffy,
be sure to give yourself an extra big breakfast to
budget for that risk. If lunch comes on time, then
lunch can be a little smaller to compensate. Keep the
focus on meal habits in the beginning, portion control
can come later.

Keep posting if you run into trouble. We wont get
tired of encouraging you.

Hoping today goes better for you,

Reinhard

&gt; today i did not have such a great food day...i was
&gt; ok until around lunch, we 
&gt; got really busy with some people in really bad shape
&gt; and i had to delay my 
&gt; lunch by 2 hours...i was so hungry by one ish that
&gt; i grabbed some candy... i was 
&gt; truly afraid that if i did not eat something that i
&gt; would make an error that 
&gt; i could not afford to make. after that, it was pick,
&gt; nibble and nosh the rest 
&gt; of my shift. i think that i could have handled today
&gt; better, but after having 
&gt; a slip i got a really bad attitude. i am sick and
&gt; tired of eating bad and 
&gt; being fat.
&gt; i will stop eating for tonight, and tomorrow will be
&gt; a no s day ( or else ! )
