Hey Sharon,
I just wanted you to know, t-tapp CAN cause lots of inch loss, but 
keeping form is hard hard HARD!!!! I TOTALLY understand your 
frustration! I did initially lose lots of inches about 2 years ago 
with t-tapp, then I got pg and that was that : ) But when I lost my 
inches, I ended up doing a 14 day boot camp and then going to the 
every other day, and lost something like 24 inches in a few months. I 
don't think my form was perfect at all, either, being a newbie to the 
program. It was after that initial loss that things started to slow 
to a crawl, and it was then that I attended a clinic and was told my 
form was way off... but it worked for me initially(?). As far as the 
measurements go, when I started t-tapp I only did measurements of one 
arm, one calf, mid-thigh, hips, belly, and bust, and I still lost a 
total of 24&quot;, so I have no idea how much more I actually lost total 

according to t-tapp measuring. Anyway, I am doing the Basic Plus 
workout for the book contest along with no-s, so we will see where I 
am in 2 months. I don't honestly have the time or energy to do the 
full workout right now, so we will see how effective the first 15 
minutes is.

&gt; Deb,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I found out about this diet from the T-Tapp website too, and have 

been
&gt; &quot;tapping&quot; off and on for 4 years. It's good for strengthening the 

core
&gt; muscles in the torso, and the ab workout is great, but I think it's 

a little
&gt; over sold on the web site - not to mention the expense of the tapes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe all fitness web sites do this, but when they say someone lost 

X number
&gt; of inches, I tend to think of that as a combo of waist, hips, 
thighs, chest
&gt; &amp; arms. What they actually do is make several measurements up your 

arms,
&gt; legs and torso and then combine all the &quot;lost inches&quot; from way more 

spots
&gt; than any normal person would consider measuring. Like I said, 
maybe it's
&gt; commonly done, but it seems a little dishonest to me.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing is the mega-extreme emphasis on form. Your starting
&gt; position (before you do any of the exercises) is this:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	Legs hip width apart
&gt; 2.	Knees bent
&gt; 3.	Knees twisted out (from the hip) so they are over your little 
toes
&gt; 4.	Butt tucked under - way under
&gt; 5.	Abdominals tight
&gt; 6.	Shoulders back and down (not pushed down with your traps, but 
pulled
&gt; down and together with your lats)
&gt; 7.	Chest out
&gt; 8.	Arms relaxed by your sides with palms forward.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; After that it gets complicated, and any failure to lose has the 
trainers
&gt; immediately attributing it to your not having done one of the above
&gt; perfectly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've found that it's great for improving balance, and I use it for 

that, but
&gt; for fat burning, nothing beats the old treadmill/exercise bike 
combo for me.
&gt;

&gt; Hi Deb, 
&gt; If T-Tapp (Teresa Tapp) is done correctly, I don't think that you 

&gt; would ever &quot;Out Grow&quot; the benefits of this exercise program. 

Teresa 
&gt; has a very long list of credentials and a lot of work in the 
progress 
&gt; of this program. Is it for everyone, probably not, worth 
&gt; investigating, it's up to the individual. Take a look, it's a lot 

&gt; harder than one might think at first glance, and about the time you 

&gt; think you've got it, it gets harder. Nothing against your trainer, 

&gt; but that's usually the response from someone that hasn't tried it. 

&gt; Okay, so back to the NoS subect, how long have you been on this WOE 

&gt; and what type of results have you had. 
&gt; I noticed last night that after preparing heaping plate and 
couldn't 
&gt; finish the whole thing, maybe there's hope for me. I haven't felt 

&gt; guilty about anything that I've eaten either. Yea.
&gt; Bye for now.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's difficult to explain, but the exercises are designed to

&gt; &gt; ....Hi Oldies :)
&gt; &gt; I will check out your TTap site... From what I understand, 
&gt; according 
&gt; &gt; to my muscle bound personal trainer who is definitely a very big 

&gt; guy,
&gt; &gt; isometric movements won't do much for the muscles because you 

have 
&gt; &gt; to work the muscle to the full extent of its range of 
motion...yes 
&gt; &gt; you will develop some endurance and burn some calories to be 

sure, 
&gt; &gt; but to really see results and improve your muscles you have to 

do, 
&gt; &gt; what he called, &quot;progressive overload&quot;... ie, if you don't 

continue 
&gt; &gt; to challenge the muscle, your results won't be optimal.
&gt; &gt; But do what you like, because that is a very important factor, 

and 
&gt; &gt; it is usually the deciding factor on whether or not you continue 

&gt; any 
&gt; &gt; exercise regimen :)
&gt; &gt; Hope NoS is going well for you
&gt; &gt; Deb
