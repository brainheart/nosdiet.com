you said:
Very funny! =P As I'm sure you could guess, there was a bag of potato
chips in the back seat, and the car has a predilection for turning into
drive-through's.

Yes&gt;LOL all the way. 
I can see where having made a trip all the way into town to buy some potato
chips with your groceries would make it hard to reason not eating them. 
I
can never seem to find a way to incorporate them into the meals I make,
except for those rare occasional cookouts of sandwiches and salads. 

That car! We are just going to have to reprogram it one of these days. 
LOL
There are so many of us at meal time, I can not reason ever loading up 
into
the car and driving to town to a drivethru and eating in the car without 
a
table cloth, plates, silverware. Just me, I suppose. And the men are so 
hot
tired, dirty from work...they just want a huge dinner and get cleaned up. 

I have heard that some of the restaurant drivethru food is good. Once a 
year
I like to skip eating dinner, and after I have everything cleaned up from
dinner, go out with a friend to have sushi. I soooo look forward to October
when I do that. Usually after the Green Harvest celebration. I figure....a
few days of feasting should be ended with something different. I just have
to remember that now with this program, to do it on the special day. :-)

Thanks for making my day, and sharing your adventure in dieting. It feels
good to know I am not alone. 

Kate
