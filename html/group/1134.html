one of the leading causes of headaches is not enough water.....I think 
point
2 
is very important. IMHO

Ok, here are some ideas:

1) have bigger lunches. Much better than falling into
a nightmare feeding frenzy because you were trying to
be too good.

2) make sure to drink plenty of water/tea/whatever it
takes short of sugar water between lunch and dinner.
Thirst is often confused for hunger.

3) do you have some kind of medical condition? If so,
or even if not so, be sure to talk to you doctor about
this. Headaches make me nervous. Maybe nosdiet is not
for you or you need an official interim meal. See:

Hoping we nail this,

Reinhard

&gt; &gt; I have been eating out of control and last night I
&gt; &gt; had all kinmds of
&gt; &gt; nightmares where I had no control of things and
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; crying and screaming in
&gt; &gt; my sleep. I had better get a grip on things!

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Reinhard is so right about how good it feels to
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; snack. To resist gives 
&gt; &gt; such a feeling of pride. Even though no one else
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; the room notices. LOL 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What I have been telling myself, if this is useful
&gt; &gt; information to anyone, is
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;you tasted that before, you don't need to taste
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; again, and an 
&gt; &gt; opportunity to taste it again will come around at
&gt; &gt; some point in your life&quot;. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This self talk seems to get me through my weak
&gt; &gt; moments. :-) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For example: chips. I have consumed enough of
&gt; &gt; those to know what the taste
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; is long after I pass over to the other side. And
&gt; &gt; when the chance to have 
&gt; &gt; them comes about, like a dinner buffet at a
&gt; picnic,
&gt; &gt; I find it easy to resist
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; them again as I make good food choices. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And what can be fun about the good food choices is
&gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &quot;I have not tasted this before....what a treat!&quot; 
&gt; &gt; LOL 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, to all.......have a great noSdietday! 
&gt; &gt;
