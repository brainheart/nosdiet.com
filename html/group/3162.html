Hi Folks!
I wanted to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart for the 
birthday greetings for my special guy... I really think it was a good 
day for him and he was really happy! So thank you guys! You are &quot;do 

gooders!&quot;
On a eating/weight note, this flu has completely screwed up our 
tastebuds... it is the weirdest thing, and it seems hard to eat 
anything and nothing tastes good! I even went out and bought some 
bottled water and we can taste all the impurities in that! You know, 
like a metallic taste... Well NoS is basically in place, but the only 
stuff we can drink and enjoy is Gatorade, and for me, sweetened iced 
tea... the food department is basically on hold till we are completely 

recovered... I know I lost 2 pounds last week, as I ate very 
little.... I really hope I keep it off once my appetite comes back to 
normal... Also, I have not had coffee, because it's just not appealing 

to me right now... I certainly couldn't imagine myself cutting out 
morning coffee, ever! LOL...
Well here's a big hug and wish for a blessed and rockin' day for all!
The Sun is finally out and I am loving it!!!!
I have another interview this Friday and I hope it goes well.
I'll let you all know :)
Peace and Love,
Debster
