&gt; HI Deb, So now that Halloween is out of the weigh !! haha we can 
&gt; really enjoy looking forward to Thanksgiving Dinner with out the 
&gt; guilt.
....Jool, now I know why we get along, we each laugh at our own 
corny jokes :) Out of the weigh is actually very clever, as a 
mnemonic for remembering not to over weigh ourselves on the scale 
and get obsessive. Well actually it's not really a mneumonic... I 
too am really going to totally enjoy Thanksgiving, as I always 
do...I won't worry or obsess on it (even if I have to spend every 
waking hour figuring how! Ha Ha :)
Seriously, it's going to be a good one for sure.

I really appreciate your support and inspiration that you are. 
....I appreciate being appreciated and feel happy to play a part in 
helping. Did you read the Ben Stein letter that &quot;BPerspicacious&quot; 

posted? I found that very inspiring... Helping others is the most 
honorable way to serve in this life...And to quote Blanche Dubois &quot;I 

have always relied on the kindness of strangers&quot;, if I have inspired 

you,in some way, I am thrilled : )

.The good news is i ate at noon and i still feel very full, 
&gt; not sure why, didnt eat that much, maybe my body is adjusting.

....That seems right to me..When I started I was hungry as could be 
that first week, just about an hour before a mealtime, but this 
really changed quickly and I do believe that the body adjusts fairly 
well :) The thing to remember, which isn't really part of the NoS 
manifesto, is that it's just not healthy to have food in your 
stomach all the time, it's really ok to be empty, and hunger is not 
a bad thing...Before NoS I forgot what it was to hear my stomach 
actually growl before lunch or dinner, an actual hunger sign... What 
a concept! 

I have already voted this am. yah.DH will do it after work, he asked 
&gt; me for my voter guide, he is pitiful :), but he trust me and wants 

&gt; to vote intellectually. I do love him dearly- all 21 years next 
&gt; month.

....Why Mrs. Robinson! Goo goo ga chook.... You lucky thing :) 
Just imagine, you are both reaching your &quot;creative&quot; peaks at the 

same time...LOL
Just make sure he brushes his teeth two times a day, and is in bed 
by ten :)

I was truly blessed to find this man. TTYL Jools
...That is wonderful, I'm sure he feels the same :)
