&gt; Thanks for the welcomes and advice! I just want to share what's 
&gt; becoming my biggest challenge. I've been trying to follow the No-
S rules, and I have no troubles until a few hours after dinner, when 
I want something sweet. 

Hi Darlene :)
Eating at night has definitely been my biggest challenge...It's like 
no one is watching, and I go on &quot;old bad habit&quot; autopilot.
Maybe when you eat dinner, you can make it a little later in the 
evening, not very late, but slightly later...Also, you might want to 
pick out some delicious fruit, like pineapple or grapes, maybe some 
borderline No S approved food like a small yogurt, and at the end of 
your meal have it as a healthy dessert...I think this would be no S 
approved, because as long as it's not a slab of cheesecake, and as 
long as it's with your meal, you can savor something sweet and 
healthy...Other than that, I just suggest keeping the stuff out of 
the house if you can't resist it being around and then wait for your 
deserved dessert on S day :)
You will find a few bumps along the way are inevitable, just ride 
over them and continue No S'ssing in the big picture..You will 
succeed.
Love,
Deb
