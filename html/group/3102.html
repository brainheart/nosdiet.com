&gt; 
&gt; Congratulations Deb on the extra inch! Celebratory
&gt; machine gun fire perfectly acceptable.
......Woohoo! Thanks Reinhard.
I'm more motivated to stick to my plan as these results were hard 
earned!!! I am proud that persistence has paid off so far :) 


&gt; Julie &amp; daughter (and Deb &amp; Richard) -- I love to hear
&gt; these parent/child nos success stories. We need more
&gt; of these. I just read another terrifying article in
&gt; the times this morning about how this is the first
&gt; generation that is going to have a shorter life
&gt; expectancy than their parents, because of obesity. I
&gt; wish it weren't so, but something has to be done. And
&gt; what other diet can you realistically, humanely do
&gt; family style?

.....Well Family Style eating was prevalent in New Orleans at most 
restaurants and you see how fat those people are... The most obese 
city in the US... personally I bet it's probably in the world, maybe 
with one exception of that Native American tribe over in New Mexico? 
The ones whose ancestors ate mostly low carb veggies and don't 
really have the genetic makeup to deal with all the corn tortillas 
and the like... It was on PBS... They have a huge diabetic 
population, and are trying to take strides to go back to healthier 
eating.... I heard that news about this being the first year the 
average mortality rate has decreased, after consistently growing for 
many years... Not surprised as diabetes has gone out of control from 
obesity becoming more the norm.
I was just commending Richie yesterday that he is doing a great 
service to himself by cutting down a lot on the junk food and not 
getting fat to begin with.... I am very proud of him and make sure 
he does get his rewards though... I mention how great his slimmer 
self looks and try to think of ways to reward him, that aren't 
necessarily with food... I often send him funny email cards or leave 
him love notes on his bed... As you can see from the photo album I 
posted yesterday on SG, I was not a fat kid...I was actually pretty 
slender, as I was always running around hyper in those early 
years...Our diet at that time, hmmm? Mom, I think, in retrospect, 
must have been close to a NoSser back in those days... I distinctly 
remember it being a total treat to just get sweetened cereal, and we 
rarely ate candy.... Unfortunately I know that my depression was 
very hard for her to deal with (she was even denying I had a problem 
all the way into my early thirties) and when I was left to my own 
devices, I started to overeat in my adolescence...And when my 
parents got divorced when I was 12 I think I was on my own for quite 
some time as they were steeped in their own miseries... Most of my 
friends were overweight too, and depressed.. I had no healthy 
measuring stick and no NoS group!
Thank you Reinhard for being a great group leader and I am now 
feeling, through my shovelglove accomplishments and NoS efforts that 
I will be enjoying this chapter of my life more than any other....
I had the worst low self esteem for so long, and that has been truly 
changing... You should figure out how you can fit &quot;S&quot; for self 

esteem into your plan, because that is the best &quot;S&quot; of all!
Love,
Deb
Have a wonderful S weeked all!
