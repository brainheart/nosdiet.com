.......See Reinhard! I told you you are a Medieval muther :)LOL!
You know, Ockham theory evolved into the Benny Hill theory years 
later &quot;when you assume, you make an ass out of u and me&quot; :)

&gt; &gt; i was even thinking of going on a juice fast, but wondering how 

i'll handle it...
...What is your motivation for the juice fast? As a weight loss 
plan I wouldn't put too much faith in it because, as soon as you go 
back to food, you will probably, 99% chance, go back up to your pre 
fast weight... You know, like when you lose weight because you have 
a stomach virus and can't have anything but Gatorade, then 
think &quot;well at least I am losing weight from being sick&quot; and voila, 

as soon as you feel better you order an eggplant parmesean sandwich 
with cinnamon stix for dessert :) Fasting does have a healthful 
purpose though, which I will mention below...

&gt;I've been hearing bad things about juice fasts (though my neighbors 

love it). Something about how it was next door to binging.
.....I had a teacher in school who talked to us about what is 
involved in doing a juice fast.. At the time he did one, he was a 
relatively young and energetic man, making his living as a 
professional dancer...he decided to go on a juice fast for detox 
purposes, not diet...Actually, it was his concern, as yours, that he 
might not be able to &quot;handle&quot; it, especially because he was putting 

on a performance in Germany and was deep into rehearsals. So his 
main worry was that it would fatigue him.... It did the opposite 
after an inital day or so of adjusting...I can't say what type of 
juice he drank, but my guess is it wasn't Sunnydelight, or Tang...
Most of our day to day utilized energy goes towards the digestion 
process... this takes a huge amount of energy, which we are fairly 
unconscious of, until you get a stomach virus and then realize that 
when not optimally functioning, digesting food is pretty challenging.
So, if you drink juice and minimize the need to &quot;digest&quot; food, then 

all that extra energy can get diverted to the other organs, mainly 
the Liver, and functions other than digestion, making it much easier 
for the body to undergo detoxification and healing. I haven't ever 
done a juice fast, but I've wanted to, and plan on it, some time in 
the warmer months..But if I do it, I will probably just do a mini-
fast for 3 days, as a week would be logistically hard (unless I was 
at some retreat and didn't have to take care of my job and family 
for a short vacation)
So, I suggest that you do NoS as a life plan, and a juice fast if 
you are interested in a short term detox plan. Not mutually 
exclusive, you can have healthy veggie juices that aren't super 
sugary :)
Let me know if you ever do it someday :)
Peace and Love,
Deb
