Hi Lee

Welc back. I did my first post yesterday :) So I can't give feedback 
on your key question you need reassurance on, but I still have some 
ideas lol

&gt;As I did in the past when I started NOS I put on weight after a few 

&gt;weeks. I originally start at 164 lbs and this morning I am 167. I 
&gt;have never in miy live have been 167 and this happened when I did 
&gt;NOS the last time. 

My suggestion is that you weigh yourself less - say once a month max, 
and at longer intervals if possible. It is really liberating.

&gt;I remember reading in the past a man who has been on it 
&gt;for the longest that it took awhile for his body to realize the new 

&gt;system it was on before he started seeing any weight loss. Over a 
&gt;month or 2. 

Also, what I think happens is that just by virtue of the system - 
gradually the choices we make for each meal become healthier and 
lighter as our bodies adjust to this regular pattern and we feel in 
charge of our lives because this is a regime/system that we can 
accommodate. Plus there is Saturday and Sunday :)

&gt;What do I have to lose? Oh, the weight!!

I am also into the power of words. One thing that has struck me is 
that 'lose' isn't a good word to use re weight. The natural, and 
powerful, word pair to lose is FIND. I don't want to find the weight 
I have 'lost'. For me I use given up ..... cos my weight has been 
about protection for me, and I don't need it any more and I am 
willing to give it up. Many other words would do depending on the 
dynamic behind your weight status: sent away, trashed, disposed of, 
erased, eradicated ........ Any word that gives some permanence to 
the disappearance. 

All the very best

Jen
