&gt; &gt; I am diabetic and monitor my blood sugar before going to bed 
and
&gt; on getting
&gt; &gt; up.I do have some natural insulin left and raw veggies aren't
&gt; hurting the
&gt; &gt; levels.I'm running tight as I've got some eye problems which 
I
&gt; don't want to
&gt; &gt; get worse.
&gt; &gt; Hana
&gt;
&gt; Dearest Hana,
&gt; Diabetes is now considered to be an official epidemic in the US,
&gt; sorry you have to go through that..I had Gestational Diabetes when 
I
&gt; was pregnant and that was probably one of the most difficult
&gt; experiences I have ever had..I have ENOUGH mood swings without my
&gt; sugar levels making things worse...I was a raving be'otch if I
&gt; needed something to eat and even put it off for only say an hour or
&gt; so..Then I'd have something and I felt like an entirely different
&gt; person.
&gt; It came from being so overweight but then, after consulting with the
&gt; hospital nutritionist and they told me simply to, drum rolll.....
&gt;
&gt; Tada!
&gt; CUT OUT SUGAR (no S, no S, no S they chanted in unison!)
&gt; After that change I was cool! Didn't need insulin, just a healthy
&gt; way of eating.
&gt; Hopefully your weight loss will help with the Diabetes...Unless you
&gt; have juvenille type, sometimes weight loss can completely reverse
&gt; the disease...I'm scared because, they told me that if I gained my
&gt; weight back (which I did this year) I might become diabetic again,
&gt; so Thank God for No S and all of your great support! It's a terrible
&gt; condition to live with.
&gt;
&gt; By the way, back to my pet topic, the acupuncture approach, the eye
&gt; is the external sense organ which is the manifestation of Liver
&gt; Chi...People with any Blood issues usually have liver issues. Don't
&gt; worry though, it is a very common thing..The liver does so much all
&gt; the time, it is really easy for it to get overwhelmed. So do
&gt; whatever you can to make life easier on your liver, maybe that will
&gt; help your eyes? The Liver is the &quot;Master Planner&quot; in traditional
&gt; Chinese medicine (TCM) and even planning too much can cause this
&gt; imbalance. In addition, Anger is the emotion associated with the
&gt; Liver..excess anger, whether expressed or suppressed will harm the
&gt; Liver Chi. So much of this is hereditary.
&gt; I am virtually blind without my contacts.
&gt; I have heard that the herbal suppliment Milk Thistle supposedly
&gt; helps the Liver. The job of the Liver in Western understanding is 
to
&gt; Store and Detoxify the Blood.. In Eastern translation this means it
&gt; is in charge of regulating the &quot;Smooth Flow of Chi&quot; Chi being 
our
&gt; energy. When things aren't running smoothly, due to emotional or
&gt; physical ups and downs, it can have an adverse effect on liver chi,
&gt; and conversely when the liver chi is deficient, things don't &quot;run
&gt; smoothly&quot; All Eastern approaches are what I like to term &quot;Chicken
&gt; and Egg&quot; relationships, very hard to tell what came first.
&gt; Diabetics blood sugar fluctuations is a form of this uneven flow of
&gt; Chi.
&gt; I love Traditional Chinese Medicine..To me it is fascinating to see
&gt; how everything functions and manifests. Hope I'm not boring you
&gt; guys :)
&gt; Again, Kudos for your veggie snacking, I'm sure it's doing you no
&gt; harm and you are well in control of your insulin checkins
&gt; God Bless
&gt; Debbie
