&gt; congrats to your dad mine will be 90 in june that will be a big 
day i can remember his 80th 

.....Thanks Cat! :) Wow Ninety? That is certainly a milestone :)
We had a great time and everyone overindulged...Richard and I felt 
completely overwhelmed physically by all the quantity, as we are 
just not overeating like that these days... by the end of the meal 
he almost fell face down into a plate of whipped cream!
They served steak for the table that was an inch thick and the plate 
was about 2 feet long, filled with mountains of fatty charbroiled 
steak...unhealthy? Yes. But it was good I tell you! However the 
next day we both felt more angry than usual and I am certain that it 
was the high dopamine levels which were a product of eating so much 
meat...
Not the kind of food which creates calm and peace (ie serentonin)
like a bowl of mac and cheese LOL :)
So it was a major S day and you should have heard the 
collective &quot;sighing&quot; and &quot;groaning&quot; the guests did when they had 
to 
shift from sitting to getting up and moving! Uhhhhhhh...... LOL It 
was funny :)
Have a great day!
Peace and Love,
Deb
