&gt; HI Deb, Totally agree, I cant even turn it on to this show. But 
did you see the girl who won fear factor new york ?? My all time 
fave was Amish in the City,probably because we have alot of Amish 
around here. In fact I was in an AMish rest.last night and I swear i 
saw the blonde girl, cant remember her name, but I know she was from 
this area,as was Randy. We liked all of the kids. and the fact there 
was no winner or loser, made it cool to watch. I agree with you 
though that its time for this mind numbing reality shows to end.Just 
give me some good dramas, more Raymond, Friends etc..Im a simple 
woman i guess.My chest muscle is no better today,makes me feel so 
weak.I dont think its my heart, feels weird. TTYL JOOLS
&gt; 
&gt; Oh man guys! Has anyone seen this? What a bunch of mindgames.
&gt; Who was the sadistic muther who came up with this one?
&gt; Yeah it's cool to watch people pumping up and jogging up and down 

&gt; hills, but it is portraying such an unhealthy way of weight loss..
&gt; Basically they are rewarding people for losing the most weight in 

&gt; the shortest time, but who could maintain that loss? Rapidly 
losing 
&gt; huge amounts of weight is so unreal....and I just hope that fat 
&gt; people around the world watching this idotic show, don't feel that 

&gt; it's a good way to go.
&gt; Another plan based on negativity.
&gt; Why am I watching this? It is making me mad!
&gt; All these cutthroat &quot;eliminate your worst team member&quot; shows, in 

the 
&gt; immortal words of Roseannrosanna Danna,
&gt; &quot;Make me sick&quot;...
&gt; Oh God please reverse the reality tv series trend, soon!
&gt; I may have to stop watching the boob tube alltogether :)
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb&quot;the slowest loser, and fine with that&quot;Feder
