....Hi Deeyala, or do you prefer Dee?
Check it out. We have almost the same name! Or at least close..

Weird eh? LOL... Look, you are starting this at the best possible 
time to do it.. *Before* you really have a problem.. You are still a 
spring chicken, but I guarantee you if you kept eating 12 meals a 
day for the next 10 years or so, you'd find that you would gain way 
more than 8 lbs over the year... It's a dismal truth that our bodies 
do slow down quite a bit as we get into our middle years... Your not 
there yet and God bless you that you are thinking of your long term 
health... Don't worry about the starving part.. Firstly it will go 
away in a few days if not a week or so, but also, remember that you 
should be having a substantial meal... Break the snacking habit and 
the seconds habit and then worry about portion control... Finally my 
portions are really changing, but I did overload quite a bit during 
the Winter (pleaaaaase let Spring Sprung already! LOL )
So don't starve yourself, this is a way to screw with your long term 
commitment... no one should ever have to starve (spoken like a true 
Jewish mother! LOL)

the part i liked the most was the shovel glove part, it didnt need 
special equipment and seemed quite easy and effort - less (turned 
out it wasnt)... 
....Oooh! Another woman warrior in Shovelglove? Hope so! Our 
numbers are growing over there :) Maybe I'll see you post on SG 
too :)

&gt; mmm.. i liked reinhard (oops.. adored him to be more precise, and 

i currently am devastated cuz he turned out to be married.. 
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...) 

....Wow Reinhard you just seem to be leaving a trail of dead women 
in your wake! LOL :)

anyway , that s why i joined the group and then i kept closely 
watching their emails for 3 weeks or a bit more (makes me sound 
like a mad stalker) before i decided they seemed nice 
and &quot;normal&quot; .. people&quot;.. people just like me..

....Ha ha! Deeyala! I think this is the most hilarious statement I 
have ever heard! You mentioned that I was your hero...Maybe you 
should know the truth.... Let's just say we, or at least myself and 
a couple of other noteables are &quot;Wacky Funny!&quot;...How's that for 

clinical diagnosis? :)
Well one thing's for sure, we are certainly a nice, down to earth 
(on most days!) friendly and supportive group...
Mad Stalker? I prefer &quot;Zealous Admirer&quot; :)
So glad to have another &quot;normal&quot; person with us! You are a cutiepie!
Do you have a picture to post on your profile? Or is is a part of 
your &quot;secret stalker&quot; files? LOL....
I'm having hotdogs for lunch now.. Isn't that exciting? 
Peace and Love,
Deb
