Hi
I find if I stay on the no s really strict when I get to the s days I dont really eat 
that much different. But if I break the rules during the no s days then on the s days 
I go a little crazy. Im not sure why. 
I have another question for the group. Since I have started this I have had good 
weeks and bad weeks. Right now I find that sometimes I just forget and was wondering 
if anyone else has that problem. I get my mind on something else and like the other 
day I sat down to eat my lunch at work and just grabbed a coke. It wasnt until I was 
on my way home that I remembered it was a no s day and I shouldnt have that. I did it 
another time too this week.
I can tell I have lost because my pants are larger on me. But Im not near a scale to 
really see. But Im going to get stricter here because my daughter is getting married 
in Feb. Im not going to say ok Im loosing this much weight by then. Im going to 
exercise as much as I can and stay on the s diet so I feel my best for when she gets 
married.

Hello Group!

I would like to say Hi and tell a little about myself. Been dieting 
for years and always looking for something new! This sounds like 
something I can live with. I'm looking to lose about 15 pounds and 
keeping it off.

So today was the first day of the noSdiet. I think I made it through 
pretty well. Here is a question. On the S days, can I snack and 
have sweets and eat my normal meals. Or do I just have the sweet 
with the meals? I'm not really a seconds person so I don't have much 
worry about that, but those two other evils (snacks and sweet) are 
something I'm going to look forward to. Those of you that went 
through your first S day did you just go out of control? Or when you 
finially got there was it just no big deal? I'm sure the second week 
wont be so crazy, but I'm sure worried about the first one. 

Thanks for the help. And I'm looking forward to read all your posts.
