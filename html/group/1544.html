&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks Reinhard! These systems have been an absolute
&gt; &gt; revelation!
&gt;
&gt; Congratulations! I need to come up with a term for
&gt; people who do all three systems... I'm hugely
&gt; flattered.
&gt;
&gt; I'm happy you found nos as easy as I did. For some it
&gt; requires a lot of work to get habituated, but others
&gt; are luckier and it barely seems like work at all. If
&gt; you're sitting on the sidelines, jump in, you might be
&gt; one of the lucky ones. Don't hesitate just because
&gt; things tend not to come easy. Things tend not to come
&gt; easy for me either, but this did. The worst that can
&gt; happen is you'll realize you need to roll up your
&gt; sleeves and really slog it out. Either way, giving it
&gt; a &quot;test&quot; run now gets you started. Better start
&gt; slogging today if that's what it's going to take.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for posting the details of your shovelglove
&gt; routine. I think this kind of stuff is very helpful
&gt; for newbies. My routine evolved as I came up with new
&gt; moves, so it's hard to say how it might have looked if
&gt; I'd had more moves in my repertoire since the
&gt; beginning. I'm glad the 21-14-7 rule is working for
&gt; you. If you're going to choose arbitrary numbers, they
&gt; might as well be lucky. The more usual 10,20, 25 etc.
&gt; reps are just so uninspiring. How can anyone take them
&gt; seriously? :-)
&gt;
&gt; Reinhard
&gt;
