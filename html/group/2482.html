&gt; Ive recently come across Reinard's interesting websites, and in 
&gt; particular, this one. So this is my first posting,
.....Hi Ceri :) Welcome!

&gt; A) what size plate are we talking about here? seemingly trivial, 
but plates come in all shapes and sizes. If you start off with a 
big one, you may be taking into too many calories, and it'll be 
diffcult to cut down if you get used to a jumbo sized one. 
.....I guess it depends on how much you snack and eat to begin 
with...If you feel like you won't be able to last about 5 hours 
between your meals then you won't want to stick to the three plate 
rule... I don't suggest a jumbo sized plate for the reason you 
mentioned (are you using jumbo now?) Why create a visual signal to 
eat buffet style? :)The reason he says overloaded is ok in the 
beginning is because the elimination of snacking between is pretty 
crucial so, get your habits down...then you can tweak around with 
the size of the portions. Since you won't feel like a martyr you're 
more likely to stick with it!

&gt; B) Does EVERYTHING have to go on one plate? What about soup? Does 

&gt; this count as your one plate? Or can you have this as a starter?
&gt; Presumably fruit doesnt count.
....No soup and fruit don't have to go next to your other food, but 
you have to adjust the portion size to account for the soup because 
we aren't supposed to be eating second courses or second servings... 
I asked the same thing. And if you eat a very hearty soup with beef 
potatoes etc... or super thick minestrone then that's it. The fruit 
is of course allowed, but it's when that counts... Eat your fruit as 
part of your meals and not in between. Contrary to what some people 
worry about, you won't pass out from starvation with 3 meals a day, 
and snacking inbetween actually acclimates your body to never 
getting used to hunger signals and then insulin is always present so 
you never really burn many calories. So have your fruit as a little 
meal dessert, but don't eat the whole bunch of bananas! (good source 
of vitamin b and potassium :)

&gt; For what its worth, one thing I've defintely found that helps with 

&gt; weight control is journalling. Writing down what you eat (though a 

&gt; tad tedious at times) bring into you conscious awareness just what 

&gt; and how much youre munching. Definitely recommended (at least to 
&gt; start with) if you do it in a non-judgemental way. 
....yes it's amazing how much most of us tend to fool ourselves into 
thinking we aren't eating that much! Then you write it down 
and &quot;busted&quot; :) The in thing to do on this plan is to &quot;Slash out 

days on habit&quot; on your calendar (I use a red marker)... If you stuck 

to the rules you make a slash :)

&gt; One last thing. I wouldnt wish to deny Reinhard any well deserved 

&gt; loot made from the sale of NOS mugs etc, but I just hope if he 
&gt; becomes a billionaire that it doesnt affect his writing style, or 

&gt; more importantly, his no-nonsense approach to weight control, 
&gt; shovelgloves, or any other interesting low-cost ideas he dreams up.
......I don't think you have to worry about this, yet, but who 
knows? :) He is a sweet, creative, down to earth &quot;do it 
yourself&quot;'er and likes to help others. Good Karma there definitely! 


Good Luck Ceri, try to be ridiculously strict as you are the one who 
will benefit.. This is a slow weight loss plan, but for many of us, 
me included, it could be faster if done &quot;To the T&quot; (or should I 

say &quot;To the S&quot;)
Peace,
Debbie
