Hi Donna,

Encourage him by your example, and by your preparation
of shared meals, but don't ram it down his throat. It
isn't right and it won't work. You might possibly be
able to get him to stick to it at home, but if he
doesn't feel like it's his initiative, there's no way
he's going to resist the candy machine at school
(resentment might make it *more* attractive). If he
sees it work for you, and you happy with it and
enjoying food again, that's the best possible
advertisement.

What to do when you're shopping and he starts
screaming &quot;please mom buy the cocoa puffs!?&quot; That's a
tough one, and my little one's too little to formulate
such requests yet, so I can't speak from experience
(except the experience of screaming for it myself when
I was a kid). I'd say, try not to buy the stuff too
often. Tell him he's welcome to buy it from his
allowance if he'd really rather have it than the GI
Joe he's also dreaming about. But it's a fine line
between making him resentful and indulging bad habits.
Best might be to treat him to sweats on s-days and let
him know he's welcome to eat what he wants other days,
it's just not going to be your treat.

But the biggest issue is yourself. If he's modeling
your bad behaviors, he'll model your good. Prioritize
getting your own habits in order. It's the best for
him and you.

Reinhard

&gt; yeah ! i made today.. although it was a little rough
&gt; tonight. i &quot;slashed&quot; off 
&gt; my day on my calender and felt a sense of
&gt; accomplishment. my precious little 
&gt; boy (12y/o) is overweight after a lifetime of
&gt; modeling my really bad eating 
&gt; habits. do you guys encourage your kids to no s ? i
&gt; think that kids might need 
&gt; snacks, but with an overweight child it is hard to
&gt; know how much to restrict 
&gt; food. thanks ! donna o
