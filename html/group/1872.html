&gt; Dear Deb,
&gt; Three inches...way better than 3 lbs. I have not stepped on the 
scale for two days now.....this is a record for me

...Thank you Bonnie : ) 
I think that NoS besides cultivating good eating habits, also has an 
indirect, additional benefit of huge worth...patience.
This is my theme for today...Our culture here in the Western world, 
and maybe in the East at this point too (with maybe the exception of 
people out in California, LOL) is so fast paced, and everything is 
geared towards speed, especially the diet fads...Patience is a 
virtue, and I can imagine that NoS is doing it's part in the Yang 
High Speed Internet, to bring things &quot;down&quot; to speed (as opposed 

to &quot;up to speed&quot;) This is another reason it's maintainable...Even 

the best runners in the world can't sprint for more than a little 
while, but no one could say that they couldn't keep up with a 
naturally paced diet like this...
Remember the tortoise of the famous fable?
*He* won the race.
It's so hard to deprogram these unrealistic ideals like &quot;lose 10 
pounds in 10 days&quot; from our memories, but just remember, in the 
words of Confucious, that,,,,,
THEY SUCK!
I am enjoying the feeling of my pants falling down, although I have 
to watch it, because now that they are below my waist, it's easy to 
give people a &quot;half moon&quot; : )

Love to all,
Grateful Deb
