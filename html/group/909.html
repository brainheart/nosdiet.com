Melanie,
I just want to comment on the idea that you have been taking care of your
family and not walking... I am a stay at home mom and I home school my 
boys.
I don't sit around much and the TV doesn't even get turned on till after
dinner time, but that doesn't seem to be enough for me either. I have to 
do
more to get moving. I always put off my time till a more convenient time
for my family. (They never ask, I just always think this or that needs 
done
first!) I know exactly how that goes.
This is what I am trying to keep in mind now. &quot; Women with a waist of 
over
35 inches are twice as likely to have heart disease&quot;:... I can take care 
of
them now and maybe not be able to see or care for them when I have
grandchildren or I can take 1/2 hour now and be with them a lot longer! 
I
still do a lot before I make myself take a walk or whatever... and honestly,
I still skip it many days... but I need to be caring for myself now, so 
I
have a better chance of caring for my family later and not them caring 
for
me. (I know first hand, my dad had a stroke brought on by heart disease 
10
years ago, he was only 52, my mom has cared for him since, he can do NOTHING
for himself now) This is not what I want to give to my family.
I am not getting down on you... really... I do the same thing... I am trying
to give you a reason to take the time you need and not feel guilty about 
it!
Have a great day!
Also, great job on the food side of the equation... sounds like your doing
great there!!!!
Happy Anniversary ... We just celebrated our 12th... That was a special 
day
and I placed no restrictions on my eating. I made sure to eat salad and 
all
my veggies then when desert came I was full, I ate a few bites and was
satisfied! Good Luck!

Subject: [nosdiet] Got a swift kick in the behind


This week I have cheated a bunch on No S days, as a result, my scale
lurched up a bit. I am not back at square one, but as I have talked
about I expected a step backward for every two steps forward. It has
really hurt me consentrating on my home this week instead of going for
my walks this week. I just need to take stock in what I am doing
right for a change, so bear with me. I am not staying up to all
hours. I am not sitting on my bottom all day reading, or watching
t.v. I have actually been up and about keeping up with the messes my
4 children plus DH make all day while they are home. I am making
better healthier choices in the food I am eating. I am cutting my
portion sizes down. I am taking better care of myself in general. I
guess I am not doing so bad after all. I just need to get my body
moving more. Now if I can just figure out how I am going to Nos my
way through my ninth anniversay this week. Any suggestions? Your
friend in health Melanie
