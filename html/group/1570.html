Hi all -

I'm in Florida, just west of West Palm Beach, and there have been a few 

disruptions here recently. I won't bother with the details because I'm not 

much different from anyone else, and thankfully we had no structural damage, 

just a lot of downed trees, inconvenience and emotional/mental 
discombobulation. =) Not to mention, a lot more work...I did a temporary 

job at Florida Power &amp; Light that took a lot out of me, and we've had 

several houseguests coming and going. Today is the first day I've again 

felt like a &quot;normal&quot; person with a &quot;normal&quot; life.

The really new members won't remember, but a few weeks ago I offered to 

design some kind of No S graphic that could be printed on T-shirts, mugs, 

etc. at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/nosdiet">http://www.cafepress.com/nosdiet</a> 
(currently empty). It was about a 
month ago that I promised to have something ready in a month. After this 

&quot;lost month&quot; in my life, I'm pushing my deadline forward a bit. =) I'm 

sure nobody minds, and I'm still planning to get this done in the near 

future. I just thought I'd pop in and update you.

I have enjoyed the recent posts about perseverance and success. It 
encourages me to jump back on the No S Wagon and find a good seat this time. 

Some may remember that my original intention was to have a successful 3-week 

initiation just before my 39th birthday (August 15). I did that, 
less-than-perfectly, but it was good practice and I continued learning about 

myself through the process. Then I went on a cruise, got distracted, had an 

out-of-town visitor to entertain for a week, caught up with neglected work 

for the following week, got ready for a hurricane, had a hurricane, cleaned 

up after a hurricane, got ready for a hurricane, had a hurricane, cleaned up 

after a hurricane, and now here I am. Excuses all, but I confess I didn't 

do as well as Lee during storm stress. I remember at least one time when my 

mind was flying in five directions and the only thing that would calm it was 

a mouthful of chocolate. =P Unfortunately, that really does work for me!

There's another long ramble building up inside me but I'll wait for a better 

time. Anyway, today I'm restarting No S and it's going to be fun. I look 

forward to posting my own successful weight loss soon. So thanks, everyone, 

for sharing.

Diane
