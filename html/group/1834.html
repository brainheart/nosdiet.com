&gt; Good Morning Everyone,
&gt; I have one regret this a.m. and that is that i didnt weigh before 

i started. I know i have lost this week i can feel it. 

....Jules :)
That's fantastic that you &quot;feel&quot; you have lost weight! It's really 

amazing how much &quot;weight&quot; (meaning importance) we give to the 

scale... I do it sometimes too, usually when I &quot;feel&quot; like I am 

doing well, and conversly I really avoid weighing when I feel like 
maybe I was &quot;off course&quot; for a couple of days...Why confirm and 

focus on a bad patch, it's mental abuse...Consider this, Reinhard 
didn't weigh himself till about 2 months into the process...He just 
focused on strengthening his &quot;habit resolve&quot;...

I have personally found that when I lost weight in the past, 1 inch 
off my waist normally equated to a weight loss of somewhere between 
5-8 lbs. So maybe consider measuring your waist...Ultimately you 
are achieving a goal of &quot;shrinking down&quot;, lbs lost can be less 

inspiring (although I can't say I have stopped with the scale either)
For example...I have lost 5 lbs so far, but because I am really 
exercising much more regularly through Urban Ranger and SG, I have 
gone down 2 inches since the beginning of September! Which seems 
more inspiring to me? The waistline...Muscle really does weigh more 
than fat because it's much denser. If I can get down into 
non &quot;plus&quot; sizes this year I will be ecstatic (literally), and this 

will happen :)
The other thing to consider on ANY diet is that often the first 5 
lbs or so, dropped, are often water weight...That doesn't mean they 
don't count though.

Anyway, this plan is so SIMPLE I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE ITS NOT BEEN 
MARKETED(JOKING REINHARD) I can tell you truly want to help 
people,give them a key to a healthy life.

....Amen! I agree :)
I tried to influence Reinhard to at least get some sort 
of &quot;thankyou&quot; tip/fee for all his efforts and giving, but he wrote 

back that it might interfere with people's trust of the system, 
since the diet industry is so loaded with &quot;false&quot; 
profiteering &quot;prophets&quot;...When he put it in those terms, I realized 

that it was the truth...It might have hindered me to try out NoS if 
there was money involved at the get go....He's just a natural at 
giving advise anyway...I looked up the name &quot;Reinhard&quot; on an 

Etymology of Names website, since it's not really a common name here 
in the US, and it actually translates into &quot;Strong (or &quot;hardy&quot;)
*Advisor*&quot; (Regin meaning; to advise)
So see, he was born to do this! LOL
Incidentally, my name, Deborah is the Hebrew word for &quot;Bee&quot;
Which probably is why I buzz around so much :)


But you could be the next John Basedow. you do have better looks 
than him and are in just as good or better physical condition.Hope I 
am not overstepping myself:) 

....John Basedow? Who the heck is that? LOL I guess it must be some 
diet guru :)
A While back, Jules, I posted a very &quot;high school&quot; mentality message 

entitled &quot;Attention Ladies, Our Founder Be'eth a Hunk&quot; when I 

discovered his &quot;Obligatory Before and After&quot; photos, noting that I 

believed the pics would &quot;inpire&quot; us! LOL. So if *THAT* didn't 

embarrass him, I don't think *anything* would!
I think that within the NoS Yahoo Group there will be a growing 
subset of NoS'sers who are Reinhard NoS Yahoo &quot;Groupies&quot;! LOL
It couldn't happen to a nicer person, and someone who, to quote an 
anonymous friend from the female contingent of NoSsers, &quot;perfect 
material for hero worship&quot; LOL :) (you know who you are, tee hee!)

well i will quit blabbering TTYL Julie
...Consider yourself amongst friends, and a lightweight blabberer. I 
think I take the blabber &quot;cake&quot; 
Keep the good vibes going! :)
Have a fun &quot;sans hurricane&quot; day in the Swamp State :)
Peace and Love,
Deb&quot;Bee&quot;
