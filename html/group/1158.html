Thanks for checking in, Tom. You were a first
generation nosdieter. Except for me, there weren't
really any long-timers when you started, so I'm glad
you made it even without &quot;reports from people who had
been on nos for a while&quot; and are now taking the time
to provide such a report to make it easier for the
next generation.

&gt; For you scale watchers: I am too. I don't recommend
&gt; it but that's what I do. The good thing 
&gt; is I never cared what the scale said. I liked not
&gt; eating like a pig, the light, healthy feeling 
&gt; of hunger before dinner, and saving money. One thing
&gt; I have noticed that may be of some 
&gt; interest and comfort to those who worry about the
&gt; stupid scale, I did not lose steadily. It 
&gt; went down in stairstep fashion. For a month and a
&gt; half or so I would see no change on the 
&gt; scale. Then all of a sudden I would drop four or
&gt; five pounds.
&gt; 

It's great that you were able to look at the scale
without really caring about it. I don't care, but I
tend to not even look, which is fine for me, but makes
it difficult for me to tell scale-watchers what to
expect. This is important, because I think that for
many people an even bigger problem than the direct
temptations of snacks, sweets, and seconds is managing
expectations; they expect a change of behavior to
immediately translate into measurable results and get
discouraged when it doesn't. They'd never have made it
to your first big drop. What they should keep in mind,
besides the fact that there will *be* plateaus, are
the considerations that you mention sustained you on
the plateaus: most importantly, the fact that the
consciousness of not being a glutton is a positive
pleasure in itself. The financial consideration is
also interesting, though I think I tend counterbalance
that by trading up on quality.

&gt; The site I have been hooked on lately is
&gt; bronzebowpublishing.com/forum. The exercises 
&gt; they talk about are a great complement to
&gt; shovelglove. 

Interesting site. I wonder if they'd be interested in
publishing a nosdiet manifesto...

Thanks again, Tom. Keep checking in every now and
then.

Reinhard
