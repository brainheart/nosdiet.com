&gt; i have been thinking lately that i do let the scale and my diet 
take too much of my life so i will concentrate on making healthy 
choices and just see where i go 
....I bet you will surprise yourself, and do great!
I had a successful first red slash day, on the calendar. 
It feels very good to take the initiative to change myself for the 
better...Why be passive about something as important as my personal 
success? I'm enjoying all the posts and stories from everyone, and 
wish you all the best.

Reinhard, I looked at that Sheldrake guys site, it was 
interesting...*I* think by supporting each other towards 
a &quot;collective goal&quot;, ie: getting serious about sticking with NoS, we 

will be able to shape our habits in our &quot;collective group 
consciousness&quot;... It will be that much easier...
All actions we take as individuals effect all humanity, because we 
are all part of the Universe, and you can't change one part of the 
Universe without it's directly impacting the Whole.
I feel like the NoS group, and it's cousin sites, SG, UR and 
Everyday, are wonderful microcosmic examples of the application of 
these Karmic Universal laws....
Ommmmmmmmmm-my goodness I am only 48 hours away from a Haagen Daz 
attack! :)
Cosmically Yours,
Deb
