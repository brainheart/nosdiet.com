go easy on the measuring deb.. u re growing addicted girl...
so ok measurements are more precise than weighing and so far u werent disappointed, 
but ur body weight, measurements and anything that quantitates ur body are prone to 
change on the hour.. something i think is called &quot;tissue topography&quot; or 
something like that !, there s constant change in ur tissue tone.. so if u want to be 
more precise say in ur weight recording or so... u should fix the time of the day u 
do it (ie:if u measure in the evenings, keep doing so.. if u do so once ur out of 
bed, keep doing it so.... etc)... i wish i could make this sound more scientific, but 
u get my point.. right?.. so if u have a late night binge, u shouldnt go measuring 
urself on the spot.. let it go for a couple of days.. and u wouldnt be that 
disapponted..

ps:try this experiment
1)wake up.... take ur measure
2)fast till noon maybe... take ur measures
3)eat..... take ur measures
4)shower ... take ur measures
5) work urself out for 1 hr in the gym... take ur measures again..
u ll find they differ even if the time interval between each activity was less than a 
SINGLE hour... try measuring in centimeters to be more accurate

as for the cheering.... GO DEBBIE GOOOOOOOOO
love
Dee

Guys I had a pretty big late night binge on home made red cabbage 
coleslaw! This morning I measured myself as I was feeling very 
lethargic and puffy.. Well I'm up a half inch on my arms and almost 
an inch on my waist...
More proof that water weight can really screw you up...
I will certainly not be stepping on any scale... I know this is a 
temporary thing and a direct result of a minor screwup, but I also 
find it boggling that my body is so sensitive to change... A healthy 
eating week usually shows up pretty quick with me, and esp. if I am 
active...but it's just as easy to blow the gain with a step back 
into the old ways... Wow...
I'm trying not to get bummed out by this..
Must breathe...
Any cheerleaders around to say 
&quot;Go Deb Go!!!&quot;
Peace and Love,
Deb
