Hi Sunshine. You ARE the person who turned me onto this site!! I got your other 
emails on VF this morning and I really appreciate you sending me that info. How long 
have you been doing this, and how much have you lost in that time? You know, I really 
should go back and read the archives and I'll probably have all my questions answered 
without bugging everybody with the same ones they have already answered a thousand 
times so far!! ;-)

Kim

Kim--Hello and welcome! 

I'm not sure, but I think I may be the one who recommended the forum 
to you (VF?).

If it was me, then I won't bore you by retelling you what I wrote 
already. If you want more details, check back a couple of days posts 
here and read my first post.

Hopefully others will chime in with their NoS experiences. You found 
a great forum!

&gt; Hello there. My name is Kim, and I came across the NoSdiet through 

somebody at another forum. I checked out the information, and I 
swear that it sounds like something I could live with!! 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm 38, divorced, and have a wonderful 11 year old daughter. I 
need to lose about 60#s! Since I don't know too much about the diet, 
will you be able to tell me how it has worked for each of you and how 
you have tailored it to meet your needs?!?!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks so much!
&gt; 
&gt; Kim
