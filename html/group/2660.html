I'm pleased to read of your and your fdaughter's success. No-S is a safe
diet for kids and I can't think it could trigger anorexia, like some diets
do. One of my nieces is anorexic and now has just manged to go up a dress
size from 8 to 10, that's British sizes, which are about 2 sizes smaller
than US and she's over 6 feet tall.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; HI Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; Just checking in and was greatly inspired by everyones post today. 
I
&gt; weighed this morn and am down a total of 5#. I am still diligently
&gt; using the treadmill and enjoying it. Was actually more than useful
&gt; last night as our heat stopped working in the house and it was 40
&gt; out. so i was cold and got real heated up on the mill. Dual funtions
&gt; i love it :) I have a long way to go to my goal weight but i am
&gt; sticking with it.
&gt; An update on my 13yo who started this with me last year. drum roll
&gt; please....... she has gone from a size 13 to a size 7 . She is a new
&gt; person. She also has cut way down on her diet pepsi(like mom like
&gt; daughter)because it makes her feel bloated(sodium and carbonation)we
&gt; are all so excited for her that she has done this for herself. noone
&gt; forced her to. Now she is counseling friends and telling them about
&gt; the NOS diet, so dont be surprised to start seeing more teens
&gt; posting some day soon. So much healthier and life giving than
&gt; anorexia and bulemia. This weekend we took out of her closet another
&gt; bag full of clothes that are falling off of her.:)))))) we are going
&gt; shopping again after work today for a few things to see her through.
&gt; She now has inches to lose and firming up in her tummy.
&gt;
&gt; On another note: I believe we all know what our &quot;best weight is&quot; 
so
&gt; i believe it is best to get to the weight of which i consider my
&gt; safe weight. I am 5'6 and weighed 175# Jan.1st. My safe weight where
&gt; i feel the best, most energy is 125# Now most people would be like
&gt; OMG that is way too thin. but i know when i am at that weight( which
&gt; i was 4 years ago) how i feel. Incredible, Sexy, Energetic, Youthful
&gt; I truthfully and whole heartedly want to see myself that way again.
&gt; So all of this to say, don't let other people set your goals for
&gt; you. If you know in your &quot;knower &quot; what you should weigh. Then 
go
&gt; for it. If you have never weighed that &quot;## &quot; but want to, then 
try
&gt; it, if you decide its too thin once you get there, we all know what
&gt; to do to put it back on now don't we :) I hope this helps some one
&gt; today, its been on my mind as people tend to ask &quot; how much are 
you
&gt; trying to lose when they find out you are on a new diet&quot; I just 
want
&gt; to tell them MYOB ( to put it nicely !)So set your short term goals
&gt; and your long term goals, we need them both to do this.
&gt;
&gt; A goal analogy for you: When I was bidding a large granite job last
&gt; year to do in the Bahamas this year. I didn't bid the job saying to
&gt; myself i will just bid one building and see how it goes, i bid all
&gt; seven buildings with the belief i would get all 7 buildings.That was
&gt; my long term goal. We would complete the work in one building at a
&gt; time(short term goals and progress) If i had as my goal to just get
&gt; one of the buildings, the corp. would have laughed me out of the
&gt; boardroom and said my belief in my company wasn't going to cut it
&gt; for this project, By the way- i did get the contract for the 7
&gt; buildings and we start in March. It will be our best year ever in
&gt; business!! So very glad I went for the whole enchilada and not just
&gt; one bite ! SO believe in yourselves, go for the whole enchilada one
&gt; bite at a time.My goals are set high at 55#, but they are doable,
&gt; because I believe in myself, this group, this NOS diet. Thanks for
&gt; everyones love and encouragement.
&gt; I am not usually this wordy,so dont get used to it :)
&gt; Love to all JOOLS
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
