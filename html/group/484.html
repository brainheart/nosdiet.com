Dear Group,
Mardi Gras found me eating a Polish Paczki....an extra fat doughnut
that is very popular on Fat Tuesday, and the sugar was a trigger. Well 
not
that I shot myself for a couple days back on the wagon again! I know for
sure that I must avoid sugar and nutrasweet, any pop ect. with that also.
Splenda is fine but the other two seem to set off the munchies for me. 
Even
on S days these are the two things I will swear off. Bonnie

Subject: [nosdiet] Re: I've fallen...






someone pick me up ?? :-\ 

Honestly...I added another S...no eating after Supper...okay, it's just 
mine
but that's the ONLY thing I've kept so far this week. I wonder if all
this snacking and sweets is because of the other S word....Stress. My
brother is coming to stay with our family for undetermined amount of time. 


I knew I had fallen..and fallen hard when I ate...gulp....a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich **gasp** really....and now I'm sooooooooooooo hungry
for the munchies. My fruit supply is gone and I need to drink more water. 

I noticed when I started this change that when I ate good I felt REALLY 
good
And when you fall into temptation and eat that &quot;M&amp;M left on your 
computer
desk&quot; that it's really hard to say, &quot;hey it was only an M&amp;M, doesn't 
mean
you have to eat that bag of *insert favourite food here*. Which, well I'm
prone to do a lot more, here a nibble there a nibble so it doesn't &quot;Seem&quot; 
as
much, but in the end (like the one I'm sitting on) it all adds up. Right? 


I always keep in the back of my mind, tomorrow is another day. ( so eat
more and start over then *jk*) But really, how long will this &quot;binge&quot; 
go
on? Is there any hope for us who lay by the roadside wading in our
chocolate syruped mudpuddles? 


Now that I've babbled, I'll return you to your previous programming. 

Pal...pondering how fast she can catch up to the wagon
