&gt; well last night was my first night of working on getting enough 
sleep i got off the computer at 10 30 because i read that the light 
from the computer stimulates the brain and keeps you from sleeping

....Hi Joce, not only the light but even the electromagnetic field 
can be picked up by your body...After all, our nervous system runs 
on electricity too! Good for you and hope you are feeling rested :)
....Normally we produce meltonin, and other nighttime hormones, 
released by the the pituitary and the Liver, and &quot;a gland&quot; (LOL 

Julie)
Light balance is very very delicate and sensitive in our &quot;sleep 
system&quot; and even the glow of a small LED from an alarm clock on a 

night table could disrupt, and inhibit the production of melatonin 
in a pretty significant way. And if you don't get enough *deep* rem 
sleep, you don't release Growth Hormone and all those good guys like 
leptin, and ghrelin, and my favorite &quot;shmellin&quot; :)... So I think 

that the Cinderella Electric Curfew is a good plan... I've even been 
toying with the idea of one of those sleep eye masks, but I don't 
know if I could get used to the feeling.. That would really block 
out the light...Light in the day, good, at night, not good....
Theres my erudite conclusion! LOL

On a food note, I went to Burger King on my way home from Family 
Court, because I was pretty hungry and it was mealtime... I was 
waiting around in the court for about 2 hours...So I ordered 
a &quot;junior&quot; size whopper, no coke, no shake... and I was just through 

a pretty stressful morning, since everyone in the court waiting room 
(child support dept.) looked like every past weird boyfriend I ever 
had! LOL, I sure know how to pick em! :) Heh heh it was pretty funny!

But nevertheless I wasn't compelled to eat a supersize anything and 
I really felt very satisfied with the smaller hamburger, it even 
felt like alot in my tummy... I'm glad that fast food isn't such a 
part of my life anymore :)
The other food thing I wanted to suggest as a really great healthy 
dessert, is frozen grapes....You just cant plow through a huge 
amount or your teeth and brain will turn to ice, and it's like 
having a very healthy and delicious &quot;fruit pop&quot;....I ate about 10 

last night and it took 20 minutes because they're so cold...Nice way 
to satisfy your sweet tooth without letting everything go to &quot;you 

know where&quot; LOL
Hope everyones doing well today!
Love,
Deb
