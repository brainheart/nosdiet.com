Hey Jools ... sorry but I'm new at this techno stuff. It's so bad that 

when my daughter leaves for college after a home visit I have to call 
her just to turn the PC on. I'm not really sure how ya doo all this 
posting stuff. Never did it but I'm open to suggestions!

I'm a divorced mother of one. Had my daughter at 40, divorced at 43, did 

that pausin' thing ar 44 and am happily single in my own home and dating 

a 40 year old. I'm goin' for it Jools. Wee-e-e-e-e-!

So, comebackatme with whatever I'm supposed to do to get posted or 
yahoo'd or whatever! Tx :-D

&gt;
&gt;Good luck to you My Heavens Jean and i hope we don't offend you 
&gt;again, we do encourage people alot, but can only do so if they 
&gt;post... I mean i guess you can lurk and get encouraged by reading 
&gt;other peoples problems and posts, Some of us have been around a long 

&gt;time and feel very comfortable expressing ourselves in different 
&gt;manners, knowing we are all welcome just as you are :)We all come 
&gt;from different walks of life, and certainly nothing boring about any 

&gt;of us LOL, we are an amazingly supportive family (so to speak, also 

&gt;a good age spread too.Which makes fort very interesting reading!
&gt;
&gt;So welcome and let us know something about you. You dont have a 
&gt;yahoo id so are you a f/m, s/m/d/ ? 
&gt;
&gt;have a great day

&gt;&gt;Hi guys a real quickie here and then off to work (I'm late too! 

&gt;&gt;ahhh!)
&gt;&gt;I went up 2 lbs or maybe three this week but I am exactly the same 

&gt;&gt;measurements... I think I will forget about weighing at this point 

&gt;&gt;and just focus on good living...
&gt;&gt;It is amazing how demotivating and depressing it is to see those 

&gt;&gt;numbers either stay the same or go up...
&gt;&gt;Fuck weighing!
&gt;&gt;(sorry but I am pissed LOL)
&gt;&gt;Good luck to all today and enjoy the weekend!
&gt;&gt;NO S Rocks!!!
&gt;&gt;Love,
&gt;&gt;Deb
