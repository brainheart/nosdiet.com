My HbA1c was 6.8and next one should be lower still, I was ssetting my
ceiling sugar level at 10 as my GP had said. Now i rarely go over7. I found
the dieticians in the hospital last year pretty useless. i had a stroke 
and
while I was in I was on their so-called Diabetic Dietand my sugars were
high. now I'm in contrrol It stays down. I find bread particularly bad,
which is a pity as I love it and bake my own.another good resource is Rick
Mendosa's website.I have e-mailed him some questions occasionally and he's
great Just put Rick Mendosa into your browser.
Where in Somerset are you? I'm in Reading and visit friends in Bristol
fairly often.

&gt; I've just been to town and bought a copy of the GI book, thanks for 
that
tip :-)
&gt; No, I'm in England too, down in Somerset!
&gt; I've got to go in for my HbA1c in a couple of weeks, but it's going to 
be
so much better than the last one, which was 14 :-(
&gt; They were considering having me into hospital for a while to try and
stabilise me as my sugars were so wildly unpredictable, but thank goodness
they're a lot lower, and don't veer so wildly now. I kept a food diary 
and
tested after every meal for a month - I had sore fingers! Now I have a 
good
idea of what makes my sugars shoot up high, so feel a lot calmer and more 
in
control. It got very scary for a while!

&gt; Look up Glycemic Index(American spelling) or GI. I find this most
helpful.
&gt; I am not on insulin diet is my main control although I take tablets, 
I
keep
&gt; an average blood sugar of 6.9 m mol/L which is about124mg/dl which is 
the
&gt; American way of measuring. Am I right/ that you are in the USA. I am 
in
&gt; England
