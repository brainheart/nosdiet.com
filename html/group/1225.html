Well, I want to get down to 130!

This week wasn't so good. I messed up on Wednesday, not as bad on 
Thursday, and about the same as Wednesday on Friday. Didn't 
exercise today, I'm super sore, although I might do some housework 
for my mom later. We went to the movies today (Princess Diaries 2) 
and I had some candy and popcorn, but not so much pop. You see, 
here's the funny thing, I spilled it on me!!! There was a little 
rip on the lid the first time I took a drink so it leeked on me 
alittle, and then I went for another drink and the lid popped off!! 
It went all over my legs!! My mom couldn't stop laughing! It was a 
good thing the movie hadn't started! *lol* Anways, I only had half 
of a sandwhich because I knew I would eat popcorn and candy at the 
movies.

Well, I guess that's it for me!! Good luck and stay strong everyone!

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all!!
&gt; 
&gt; I just caught up on posts, I kind of dropped out of here for a 
bit, 
&gt; but I'm back!! First of all, congratulations on your daughter! 
&gt; Secondly, welcome all new members!!
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I stared this diet and did it for about a week and then 
quit. 
&gt; Well, last week I got super serious, and I'm back!! Last week I 
&gt; slipped on Wednesday, quite badly, but I got back with it one 
&gt; Thursday! I didn't go overboard on the weekend, and I haven't 
&gt; messed up today!! I almost broke down and had a piece of banana 
&gt; bread that we baked today, but forced myself to wait for dinner, 
and 
&gt; now I'm SO glad that I did!! My mom and I are going to the gym 
&gt; tonight. This will be our third day in a row in awhile. We've 
been 
&gt; going to the gym more, and yesterday I burned 256 calories on the 

&gt; treadmill alone!! Yes, I'm FINALLY using the machines!! And 
&gt; everyday we go to the gym I walk anywhere from 2.20 miles to 2.55 

&gt; miles total!! My mom and I went shopping last week, and she 
&gt; couldn't believe how thin I looked!! And, when I went to go get 
my 
&gt; haircut, the lady (a family friend) even said that I'm getting 
&gt; thin!! I felt so good!! And it's major encouragement to keep on 
&gt; doing what I am doing!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I hope everyone is doing good and staying (or trying to 
&gt; stay) healthy!
&gt;
