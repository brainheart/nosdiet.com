um
*embarrassed face*
actually, walking is part of the problem.

i've been trying to get steady exercise but i have a serious structural 
pro=
blem with most of my joints - hips being the worst. therefore, any kind 
of=
physical activity can cause shooting pains (meaning i don't know when or 
w=
here or how it'll happen, but when it does happen it's bad), and if the 
int=
ensity of the shooting pains is high enough it causes a corresponding inten=
se emotional trigger that can last for hours, subsequently causing grinding=
of teeth yadda yadda. the joint problem/pain is its own thing i've been 
g=
oing to multiple drs and allopaths for several years now to fix; it's the 
e=
motional response i'm trying to damp down, since that lasts so much longer 
=
than the pain does. physical therapy exercises aren't too intensive, so i 
=
need *something* to help.=20=20

i've been trying the carrots option offered here - it helps a little. i'm 
=
also trying to drink a lot more water. i sometimes put lime or lemon juice=
in it. i'm also buying mass amt's of pickles, since they have a minimal 
c=
alorie load. debating going to three meals, at 12:45 / 6 / random needed 
p=
m time instead of my original 12:30 / 8:30 plan.

still working on it - was sort of hoping someone had a better idea than 
i'd=
had ;)

&gt;Emotional eating (eating because you're stressed or
&gt;depressed) is a little like emotional marksmanship --
&gt;not a good idea. Try this instead: emotional exercise.
&gt;Nothing fancy, necessarily, just a little walk will
&gt;do. Doesn't have to be a safari, around the block a
&gt;few times is sufficient. Don't groan and ignore me
&gt;just yet. Consider:
&gt;
&gt;1) how the eating just makes you more depressed and
&gt;stressed (and fat).
&gt;
&gt;2) how a little walk does the opposite. And this isn't
&gt;the only benefit: you have leisure to *think* about
&gt;whatever is stressing or depressing you. Because
&gt;walking irrationally makes you happy (both because of
&gt;the sense that you are moving towards a destination
&gt;and because of the endorphins or whatever) you are
&gt;more likely to find a solution or pep yourself up than
&gt;you would be with mere stationary thinking.
&gt;
&gt;Don't plead lack of time. Just get yourself out of the
&gt;house. As for how long your walk should be, make that
&gt;decision once your feet are in motion. You're in no
&gt;condition to think properly, even about as little a
&gt;thing as this, cooped up inside next to the
&gt;refrigerator.
