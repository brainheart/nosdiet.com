&gt; From: 
&gt; Dear Debbie,
&gt; What diet were you doing when you weighed 165? Were you depressed 

because
&gt; you gained weight after diet success, or did something else depress 

you and
&gt; you started mindless eating?
&gt; I weigh 157 now, but most of my life I was around 120, female at 
5ft. 4in,
&gt; is a little skinny, but now I wish I had such problems now. My 
weight
&gt; started piling on not from depression, but from stopping smoking a 

horrible
&gt; bad habit I had for years, and will never do again. seems some of 

those real
&gt; low carb diets are bad if you are not careful when you stop doing 

them, the
&gt; weight comes back.

Hi Bonnie :)
I am 37 now. During the two years, between 1994-96, when I was with 
my sons father, I lived in New Orleans and was taking care of 3 
stepchildren...I was essentially living a completely insane life at 
the time, filled with &quot;disfunction&quot; but my sons dad was a musician so 

I like to think of it as dis-funk-tion.
All kidding aside, it was a bad place for me to be, but nevertheless, 
my destiny... People dont go to NOLA and eat lean cuisine, plus most 
people look like Paul Prudhomme so we have got no healthy role model 
to look at (unless you count the strippers in the French Quarter!)
Anyway, when I gave birth to my son I was at my heaviest, not because 
of the pregnancy, I only gained about 20 from that, it was the screwy 
relationship (very major league screwy)
When I finally broke it off with him and decided to start taking care 
of myself, the first year I lost around 18 in a somewhat quick way, 
by doing this effective, yet somewhat gimmicky excercise called &quot;Body 

Flex&quot; It was like a high, every time I did it, but I never kept it 

up. I'm not sure why. I was doing a very physical job at the time, 
with lots of walking and delivering stuff all over the place. I never 
took the elevator and was pretty active then. Maybe I was bored with 
it. Then I went on Herbalife and lost about 25 pounds, but that was 
purely because of the Ma Huang stimulants that I had to buy each 
month, and they really did work, but the jury is back in and it is 
considered to be a very dangerous herb which is linked to stroke and 
heart attack. Also, lets face it, who wants to drink shakes all the 
time? It was fine for the Summer, but it really got old in the cooler 
months. Ok we are almost at the end. During the time I went to the 
Swedish Institute of Massage in NY, I took the insurance off my car 
and had to walk everywhere for 16 months. I clocked my daily walking 
to and from the train station in my town and from the city to the 
school, and it was actually 3 miles a day. I don't care what any 
personal trainer says, walking does really make a huge impact on 
metabolism...In only three months after my school ended and I stopped 
my walking routine, I started gaining all over again. I went from 
around 170 to 215 in one year. My eating, and binging during the 
dark months just went from bad to worse and then some...
I hate feeling tired all the time, and having no get up and go, but I 
was really not interested in trying some quick fix again, especially 
one containing heart attack inducing stimulants (which now by the way 
are illegal, because some kids died using them)
I am completely satisfied with the concepts and philosophy underlying 
the NoS plan because I could do the quick fix again, but time and 
experience has taught me that it is better to do something that is 
maintenence driven...I am worth waiting for, I don't mind if it takes 
me 2 or even three years to get to my goal...My goal IS maintenence.
I know this was a long one. Thanks for your interest.
PS. Nicotine is a very, very powerful stimulant...It is not 
surprising that you had more of an appetite when you quit smoking. 
Thats like being on speed. 
Kudos to you for quitting!
Love
Debbie :)
