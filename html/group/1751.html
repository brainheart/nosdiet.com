A friend sent this to me. I had heard about Ben's last column, but had
not looked it up. It is better read than any description. 

As you read it you can hear Ben Stein. His words echo in your mind, not
just letters turning into words for your eyes to see. He reminds us of
life worth living.

A bell isn't heard until it is rung , it is my hope we will all keep
Ben's &quot;bell&quot; ringing.

For many years Ben Stein has written a biweekly column for the online
website called &quot;Monday Night At Morton's&quot;. (Morton's is a famous 
chain
of Steakhouses known to be frequented by movie stars and famous people
from around the globe) Now, Ben is terminating the column to move on to
other things in his life. Reading his final column is worth a few
minutes of your time because it praises the most unselfish among us and
portrays a valuable lesson learned in his life.

This was Ben Stein's Last Column...
____________________________________________________________

by Ben Stein---

How Can Someone Who Lives in insane luxury be a &quot;star&quot; in today's 
world?
As I begin to write this, I &quot;slug&quot; it, as we writers say, which means 
I
put a heading on top of the document to identify it. This heading is
&quot;eonlineFINAL,&quot; and it gives me a shiver to write it. I have been 
doing
this column for so long that I cannot even recall when I started. I
loved writing this column so much for so long I came to believe it would
never end. It worked well for a long time, but gradually, my changing as
a person and the world's change have overtaken it.

On a small scale, Morton's, while better than ever, no longer attracts
as many stars as it used to. It still brings in the rich people in
droves 
and definitely some stars. I saw Samuel L. Jackson there a few days ago,
and we had a nice visit, and right before that, I saw and had a splendid
talk with Warren Beatty in an elevator, in which we agreed that Splendor
in the Grass was a super movie. But Morton's is not the star galaxy it
once was, though it probably will be again. Beyond that, a bigger
change has happened. I no longer think Hollywood 
stars are terribly important. They are uniformly pleasant, friendly
people, and they treat me better than I deserve to be treated. But a man
or woman who makes a huge wage for memorizing lines and reciting them in
front of a camera is no longer my idea of something we should all look
up to.

How can a man or woman who makes an eight-figure wage and lives in
insane luxury really be a star in today's world, if by a &quot;star&quot; we 
mean
someone bright and powerful and attractive as a role model?

Real stars are not riding around in the backs of limousines or in
Porsches or getting trained in yoga or Pilates and eating only raw fruit
while they have Vietnamese girls do their nails. They can be
interesting, nice people, but they are not heroes to me any longer. A
real star is the soldier of the 4th Infantry Division who poked his head
into a hole on a farm near Tikrit, Iraq. He could have been met by a 
bomb or a hail of AK-47 bullets. Instead, he faced an abject Saddam
Hussein and the gratitude of all of the decent people of the world.

A real star is the U.S. soldier who was sent to disarm a bomb next to a
road north of Baghdad. He approached it, and the bomb went off and
killed him. A real star, the kind who haunts my memory night and day,
is the U.S. soldier in Baghdad who saw a little girl playing with a
piece of unexploded ordnance on a street near where he was guarding a
station. He pushed her aside and threw himself on it just as it
exploded. He left a family desolate in California and a little girl
alive in Baghdad.

The stars who deserve media attention are not the ones who have lavish
weddings on TV but the ones who patrol the streets of Mosul even after
two of their buddies were murdered and their bodies battered and
stripped for the sin of trying to protect Iraqis from terrorists.

We put couples with incomes of $100 million a year on the covers of our
magazines. The noncoms and officers who barely scrape by on military pay
but stand on guard in Afghanistan and Iraq and on ships and in
submarines and near the Arctic Circle are anonymous as they live and
die.

I am no longer comfortable being a part of the system that has such poor
values, and I do not want to perpetuate those values by pretending that
who is eating at Morton's is a big subject. There are plenty of other
stars in the American firmament....the policemen and women who go off on
patrol in South Central and have no idea if they will return alive. The
orderlies and paramedics who bring in people who have been in terrible
accidents and prepare them for surgery, the teachers and nurses who
throw their whole spirits into caring for autistic children, the kind
men and women who work in hospices and in cancer wards. Think of each
and every fireman who was running up the stairs at the World Trade
Center as the towers began to collapse.

Now you have my idea of a real hero. We are not responsible for the
operation of the universe, and what happens to us is not terribly 
important.

God is real, not a fiction, and when we turn over our lives to Him, He
takes far better care of us than we could ever do for ourselves. In a
word, we make ourselves sane when we fire ourselves as the directors of
the movie of our lives and turn the power over to Him. I came to realize
that life lived to help others is the only one that matters. This is my
highest and best use as a human.

I can put it another way. Years ago, I realized I could never be as
great an actor as Olivier or as good a comic as Steve Martin....or
Martin Mull or Fred Willard--or as good an economist as Samuelson or
Friedman or as good a writer as Fitzgerald. Or even remotely close to
any of them. But I could be a devoted father to my son, husband to my
wife and, above all, a good son to the parents who had done so much for
me. This came to be my main task in life. I did it moderately well with
my son, pretty well with my wife and well indeed with my parents (with
my sister's help).

I cared for and paid attention to them in their declining years. I
stayed with my father as he got sick, went into extremis and then into 
a
coma and then entered immortality with my sister and me reading him the
Psalms.

This was the only point at which my life touched the lives of the
soldiers in Iraq or the firefighters in New York. I came to realize that
life lived to help others is the only one that matters and that it is my
duty, in return for the lavish life God has devolved upon me, to help
others He has placed in my path. This is my highest and best use as a
human.
