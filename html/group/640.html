Hi Joy,

I'm happy to hear you've decided to get up and give it
another go. There isn't *really* another choice. There
may be other systems you can try, but when it comes
down to it, long term weight loss is about
fundamentally changing your habits. It's hard, but
it's necessary. And if you look at it straight on,
it's less hard. 

I'm less concerned about your first weekend (my first
few weekends were pretty lousy too) than about your 3
AM snack cake. As I've mentioned before, getting your
weekdays straight is the most will-effective means of
dealing with your weekends. Why? 

1) The habit carries over to the weekend, not 100%,
and not right away, but eventually, and enough to make
a crucial difference. 

2) These daily successes build your willpower and
confidence. If #1 is slow or insufficient, this is
your backup.

3) Simple attention makes a big difference. You've
practiced this during the week, and it's not going to
go away on the weekend. Treats are consciously
enjoyed, and excesses set off alarms. This lowers the
threshold for #2 kicking in.

4) It's not the whole problem, but it's the tractable
part. You can do this. And once once you have, those
other, trickier parts come into striking range.

On a practical level, I'd try to get the cakes out of
the house. If that doesn't fly, give yourself a little
protocol for how to deal with 3 AM cravings. Drink a
glass of water. Wait a minute. Wait another minute.
Still awake? If necessary, fruit is better than debbie
cakes. 1 debbie cake is better than 2, etc. Practice
damage control. Catching yourself in mid failure and
preventing it from becoming a total disaster is hugely
difficult, a great, but (and this is the kicker)
completely unsatisfying accomplishment. You have to
rely on your intellect, that notoriously unworthy
ally, to remind you how important it is. I think the
only way to pull this off is to brace yourself in
advance. 

I wouldn't worry about your husband. If he's seriously
underweight, 3 solid meals might be just what he
needs. As I wrote on the home page, the diet &quot;works
both ways, which I think is further confirmation of
its fundamental elegance and sanity.&quot;

Best of luck, and keep us posted,

Reinhard

&gt; Hello everyone. Well, I haven't posted here again
&gt; because I figured that the noS diet wouldn't work
&gt; for me. On my first weekend, I ate like a total
&gt; pig. I wasn't able to keep myself from snacking,
&gt; and put the 2 lbs I had lost right back on. For me,
&gt; it's difficult to stop with one little snack. You
&gt; know like with Lays potato chips - you can't eat
&gt; just one. Well, I'm that way with LOTS of types of
&gt; snacks. However, I am going to try REALLY HARD to
&gt; get back onto this plan. Since I can eat some fruit
&gt; - and I love fruit - then maybe I can handle it. 
&gt; I'll just have to follow the rules more closely. I
&gt; also try to stay away from carbs as much as
&gt; possible. Bread and pasta are binge triggers for
&gt; me. A couple of baked potatoes a week probably will
&gt; be okay. But honestly it doesn't take much to get
&gt; me snacking indiscriminately. :( Last night I got
&gt; up at 3:00 in the morning and had a snack cake. I
&gt; have those snack cakes in the house for my
&gt; grandson's lunch. I try to get him to eat
&gt; fruit instead of cookies or snack cakes, but he
&gt; doesn't eat fruit well. I'll have to work on it
&gt; some more with him. But he is a little underweight,
&gt; so I really don't want to put him on any kind of a
&gt; diet that will keep him from putting on weight. Why
&gt; is it that food is such a stressor???!!! Anyway, 
&gt; everyone keep me in your thoughts as I am going to
&gt; give this another try. I'm kind of desperate to
&gt; find a way of eating healthfully that will work for
&gt; me and my husband. I really need to lose at least
&gt; 20 pounds.

&gt; Subject: starting on a noS day
&gt; 
&gt; I am the disgusting slovenly pig who made the
&gt; suggestion about starting
&gt; on a noS day. I discovered the website on a Saturday
&gt; and made a decision
&gt; to start on Monday. During the weekend, I had a lot
&gt; of time to pay
&gt; attention to my eating habits, which was useful in
&gt; and of itself; I also
&gt; was able to think about what I wanted to eat and how
&gt; I was going to
&gt; manage my meals come Monday. I am prone to
&gt; hyperbole; sorry if I
&gt; offended anyone.

&gt; 
&gt; You didn't offend me. In fact yesterday I was
&gt; beating myself up for 
&gt; being piggy. In fact I found this website by
&gt; punching in the words I 
&gt; am fat on my search engine. That is how bad I felt
&gt; about my weight.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a great week last week but during the weekend
&gt; I had alot of 
&gt; food. Monday I put the 2 lbs on that I had taken off
&gt; and was very 
&gt; upset. (Ladies, I am also suffering from those
&gt; monthly cravings we 
&gt; get.) I did good Monday but yesterday I just broke
&gt; all the rules and 
&gt; mentally beat myself up and hid from the group. I am
&gt; over that now 
&gt; and can go on again. I am still having the cravings
&gt; but I think my 
&gt; body has to get back to the sugar leaving my body
&gt; and settling down. 
&gt; Last week that took a couple of days and then I was
&gt; fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks everyone for the help.
