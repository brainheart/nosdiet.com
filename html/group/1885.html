Hi Lee,

Just pretend you were celebrating &quot;transylvanian
halloween,&quot; a few time zones off. No, such shenanigans
aren't a good idea in general, but it's a shame to get
demoralized when you're on such a roll, and you should
give yourself credit for damage control (I'm happy
urban ranger played a role). It sounds like your
failure was less excessive than my success. I didn't
bother counting my almond joys, butter fingers, baby
ruths, and nestle crunches, but I'm sure it was way
more than 6.

But you see why it is so important to give yourself
those holidays. I can afford and enjoy halloween
excess because I know it won't spill over to the next
week.

A couple of thoughts on halloween leftovers: 

1. thanks to all those lovely chemicals and
preservatives they keep forever, so you can enjoy them
next weekend etc. It's not now or never.

2. unlike orphan children, if you leave them lying
around somewhere, they will be taken care of
(hopefully not by another no-s-dieter).

Best of luck and hope you and DH stay &quot;better,&quot;

Reinhard

&gt; OK, I feel better. Moving can help work it off. I
&gt; didn't grab 
&gt; food to feel better either so I am glad about that. 
&gt; DH is better 
&gt; too. I wonder if those candies I had earlier
&gt; affected my mood?. 
&gt; Well onward.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; The men are probably saying typical female and mood
&gt; swings. :)
