Hey Bonnie

I can't really say what a typical day is like, it changes a lot. These days I'm 
having a big bowl of breakfast cereal, with either soya or full-fat milk, plus a 
piece of fruit for breakfast. A couple of sandwiches for lunch (Irish sandwiches are 
smaller than American ones), and maybe two fish peices with potatoes and some kind of 
vegetable for dinner. I always feel contently full after my meals, but not stuffed. 


I travel a lot and I work shift-work, so sometimes I have very long days, and those 
days I might have four or maybe even five meals, but they're usually moderately 
sized.

I think the important peice for me is that I have a rhythm: full-hungry-full-hungry.......etc. 
It's nice, feels very natural. 

Love, Brian

Hi folks

At Reinhard's invitation, I want to brag about my progress! I started this
sometime last summer or fall, can't remember exactly. I lost 40-50 lbs 
and
seem to be holding steady around 185lbs for several months now, which is
good for my height and i'm happy with it. I'm still doing no-s, it seems
once I got to my ideal weight I stopped losing it.

Sensible balanced eating. No way-out menu's. I love it! I've never felt 
so
content about my weight or my appetite.

Still have urges and break-outs from time to time, but they're not the
gluttonous food orgies they used to be.

Love, Brian
