&gt; HI everyone, I am finally back !!I can hardly believe its been 
three weeks ( i think) since the last i posted. The holidays were 
killer for me in more ways than dieting. I weighed on Jan. 1st and 
shocked myself into a new commitment. I weigh more now than when i 
was 9mos pregnant with my last child 14 years ago! very 
disheartening as i have nothing to show for it but an expanded waist 
line and a closet full of clothes that are too tight. SOOOO I have 
taken up walking again. we bought a used but new to us treadmill. We 
are all using it regulary 3-4 times a week.Its not in the bedroom 
(so it cant be used as a clothes hanger LOL)I started anew with NOS 
last monday the 3rd, and this time i measured myself and wrote it 
down.
.....Good for you Jools! Recommitted is the way to go :) I'm sorry 
you feel like things are on the down side with diet...just keep 
trying! For me, yesterday was pretty lame, but instead of going on a 
non-stop binge and throwing in the towel, I am back on track today.
For you own sake, try not to compare yourself to time so far back in 
your life... You are in a new stage of life and look forwards for 
inspiration... If I wanted to get really depressed I would look at 
all my high school pictures and thing &quot;Hmmm.. I wasn't really that 

overweight, look at me now... I can't believe it!&quot; (insert your own 

self depricating comment to personalize this... :) And that is a 
weird thing anyway, because my self esteem was so crummy then, that 
I felt less than beautiful when I was pretty great looking, so 
strange our inner voices, infact I was below what my goal weight is 
right now! So go figure? I would kill to look like I did then, but 
that's not my reality now, so why torture myself...who knows, maybe 
one day.. Meanwhile I have to take it day by day...
So forget about 14 years ago Joolers, because this is unproductive 
thinking... Now. If you can use the past to get you psyched up then 
by all means do it...but it doesn't need to be in a style which 
beats the momentum out of you and gets you really bummed. The 
treadmill is a good addition for a healthy new you!
I'm glad you are back! I really missed your great and fun posts!
Love,
Deberoo!
