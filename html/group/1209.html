Welcome Thom, Shannon. The beginning is the hardest
part, but the stricter you are up front the faster it
gets easier.

My rule is anything goes on S-days. Sweets, seconds,
snacks, whatever. This may sound irresponsible and
like an invitation to gorge, but here's my rationale:

1) if you don't give yourself an official break from
the rules you will take an unofficial one (or two, or
ten) and that tends to be much worse. Knowing that you
have an unrestricted S-day coming is also great
incentive to hold out during the week. The cookie or
whatever your are longing for during the week is much
easier to resist if you know you will be able to enjoy
it, and whatever else you want, come the weekend.

2) The habits you build during the non-s days do
eventually to carry over to the weekends. Less will
seem like more. Maybe not right away (do be prepared
for a bit of excess the first few weekends), but if
you're strict during the week, sooner than you think.
The rules train you. They change your natural,
unconscious responses. Sure, the rules are easy to
remember, but that's only secondary: the idea is they
change your appetite so that you don't have to
remember (this does take a while, don't feel
inadequate if you don't feel this right away). To use
a somewhat unpleasant analogy: it's like a lab rat
getting a shock when he touches the red door. Even
when the shock is removed, he's not going to be too
keen on that door. Hopefully your &quot;red door&quot; is more
enjoyable when you choose to open it, but the learning
principle is the same. The week and its rules are
training wheels for the ruleless weekend. You'll fall
down a bit the first few times but eventually what a
liberating feeling to ride without them, even if it's
just for a bit.

I don't have any experience with gastric bypass, so I
don't know how good my advice is going to be, but
here's something that seems like it might be important
to consider: make sure there is as little fuzziness as
possible around what defines a meal. I'm not sure,
given your smaller stomach size, how often it's
medically recommended to eat (I
'm assuming it's greater than 3), but be sure to
consult with your doctor, figure out that number, and
stick with it. There should be no &quot;well, this is kind
of a snack, but you could consider it a meal.&quot; At
first, developing proper meal habits is more important
than restricting calories. So don't be overambitious,
make your meals big enough to tide you over to the
next. Once you have the literal habits down, it's much
easier to tighten the caloric reigns. And do be sure
to run this all by your doctor.

Best of luck to you both, and keep on posting,

Reinhard

&gt; Shannon,

&gt; I have the same question so I hope to hear an answer
&gt; too. By the way, I too
&gt; am new to the No S Diet. Started Monday. Perhaps
&gt; we can keep track of each
&gt; other. I am looking to lose a lot more than you. 
&gt; My goal is to drop 60
&gt; pounds.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello Group!
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to say Hi and tell a little about
&gt; myself. Been dieting 
&gt; for years and always looking for something new! 
&gt; This sounds like 
&gt; something I can live with. I'm looking to lose about
&gt; 15 pounds and 
&gt; keeping it off.
&gt; 
&gt; So today was the first day of the noSdiet. I think
&gt; I made it through 
&gt; pretty well. Here is a question. On the S days,
&gt; can I snack and 
&gt; have sweets and eat my normal meals. Or do I just
&gt; have the sweet 
&gt; with the meals? I'm not really a seconds person so I
&gt; don't have much 
&gt; worry about that, but those two other evils (snacks
&gt; and sweet) are 
&gt; something I'm going to look forward to. Those of
&gt; you that went 
&gt; through your first S day did you just go out of
&gt; control? Or when you 
&gt; finially got there was it just no big deal? I'm
&gt; sure the second week 
&gt; wont be so crazy, but I'm sure worried about the
&gt; first one. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help. And I'm looking forward to
&gt; read all your posts.
