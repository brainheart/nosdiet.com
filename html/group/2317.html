I am just thrilled that I followed No S with absolute perfection this
week. And today (Saturday) I ate normally - 3 meals but I did have a
candy bar. But no second portions, no other snacks. The candy bar was
the only extra. I didn't even want to pig out like I used to. Maybe I am
finally *getting* it and will succeed this time. I think about how I
used to stuff myself (emotional eating mostly) and it's just disgusting
to me anymore....I have no desire to do it anymore, especially with the
way I feel afterward. 

I am really thrilled about this week because it was one of the most
stressful weeks of my life! Nothing major - noone died, lost a job, had
a fire.....nothing like that. Just some major personal stuff in my life
and some exaggerated everyday stress thrown in. When it rains, it pours,
huh? This is a big accomplishment.....because I was stressed out every
single day and didn't cave. This is such a breakthrough! I am excited
because if I can do this on such a stressful week, I can do it ANY WEEK. 


Just had to share! 

I got back on the No S wagon recently and lost 8 pounds in 2 weeks. I
know it sounds like a lot, but with the way I was overeating it was a
drastic cut in calories. And I am not suffering or starving!
