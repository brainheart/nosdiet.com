ok i am really going to do this and stick to the rules
sounds too good to be true and its going to be hard not to eat in the
evenings but i took the suggestion and ate at 7 so it was later and i dindt
have that much to get thru
i have been low carbing since 96 and i am just burned out on not being 
able
to eat with other people and being a pain all the time about my meals .. 
i
made it thru today tho :) 
today i thought about that when i lived at home with my parents i ate three
meals .... i ate what i was served we didnt snack .. we had no snack food
and as my mother had no car and had to walk to the store we were not allowed
to help ourselves to food . it was for meals
i ate three good meals a day and never had a weight problem .i never thought
about food other than to eat what was put on my plate ... we also had no 
tv
so i got a lot of exercise ....when i was 16 we got a tv and we also moved
out in the country and my mom got a car and a freezer so she could go to
town once a week and stock up so we had more food around and i started
snacking while watching TV 
and i started gaining weight and it was just a terrible cycle of feeling 
bad
so eating more .. then when i left home and was on my own all i did was 
eat
junk food because i could.. so if i ate three meals a day and never had 
a
weight problem it makes sense that snacking is not a good thing.. so getting
back to scheduled meals and no eating between meals makes sense .. another
good thing is avoiding artificial sweetners..on low carb you start accepting
them . and making them part of your daily menu then you end up eating low
carb junk food all the time instead of healthy things..
i am going to limit them as much as i would sugar..
