&gt;good luck in figuring this one out, maybe Reinhard will have a 
deeper insight into it. Something to do with a gland i think ?? 

....Well, you're getting hot Jool, I like your guess, and yes 
certain glands do secrete stuff during digestion, maybe you are 
thinking of the pituitary gland, which is the master gland of the 
body...but the main center which determines our &quot;drives&quot; ie: thirst, 

sex, sleep, and of course, hunger, is the hypothalamus, the part of 
the brain which constitutes our limbic system, and our autonomic 
nervous system, specifically the parasympathetic ans....
Nerve impulses can travel incredibly fast in the musculoskeletal 
system...you step on a tack or touch your finger to a lit match, and 
those impulses run along nerve pathways at speeds of over 250 miles 
per hour.... The autonomic sympathetic/parasympathetic system, which 
is the part which innervates our internal organs runs at much slower 
speeds....don't quote me on this, because I am going on &quot;memory&quot; 

(which is waning daily) I think the impulses are more like 30 miles 
per hour... So in general, it takes longer to get these signals in 
the brain...then add to this the fact that so long as the 
sympathetic nervous system, aka &quot;fight or flight&quot; is &quot;on&quot; the 

parasympathetic nervous system, aka &quot;rest and *digest*&quot; is off, and 

vice versa.... So if you are very nervous or eating &quot;on the run&quot; 

and your body doesn't really get into that rest and digest mode, 
because you are fired up for some reason, those fullness signals 
will take even longer to feel, beyond the fact that they inherently 
take longer to get to the hypothalamus... Okay I'm kindof tired guys 
because I got up at 4:45! It's now 9:36 so if I made some serious 
run-on sentences and stuff, sorry :)
If I totally confused you sorry also, but I think you are all able 
to understand this....I hope :)
Peace, Love, and Neurology,
Deb
