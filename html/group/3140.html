&gt; Any suggestions on curbing the late night snacking that I have 
become so great at??

...Well firstly, let me tell you that eating mindlessly infront of 
the television is probably the worst &quot;unconscious&quot; behavior for a 

huge amount of people... not just you..
Perhaps you can arm yourself with good cut up carrots and 
celery...or a few cups of grapes or blueberries with a yogurt...In 
the beginning you may need to have a fourth &quot;healthy snack type 
meal&quot; which gets you through the first few months of revamping your 

old habits... I know exactly how you feel.. I can't say this 
proudly, but I still eat at least half of my meals infront of the 
television...I was just thinking of how this behavior is really 
harmful... Well at this point, I'd still say to focus on one or two 
major issues and don't overwhelm yourself with 10 different goals... 
Start with your soda and sweets consumption... simply cutting out 
sweets and soda for 80 percent of the week has made a HUGE impact on 
me and my son's gaining patterns...For me, eating in front of the tv 
I attibute to habit and also, plain old lonliness... It is getting 
better though... I'm finally at the point (more than six months in) 
that I can enjoy watching an evening show without cleaning out the 
fridge... Yay!
If you find you are just watching nothing special, and eating at 
every commercial, just to kill time,,, think of other ways to enjoy 
that time which won't be linked to eating...
Perhaps go and do some exciting chores, or take a &quot;spa&quot; hour and do 

your nails or have some tea and curl up with a book...If you get 
busy with some project that involves your hands, I have heard that 
this is a good way to get your mind off food... With tv, you have a 
million Burger King commercials reminding you to stuff your face 
every 10 minutes...
TV is pretty much, inextricably linked to noshing endlessly...
If need be, just switch it off and remove yourself... As boring as 
this sounds, you probably need more rest anyway, so why not just 
take a hot relaxing shower and head into bed early?
Good luck Karen...

You can do it!
Love,
Deb
(who is still sneezing her face off onto the floor and hurting all 
over!)
Sympathy groans all? LOL...
