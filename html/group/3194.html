&gt; way to go deb
&gt; WOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO
&gt; with this rate i estimate u'll be at ur optimum fitness before 
winter (after all it's only spring)

.....Thanks for the Woohoo Dee :)
However, it will take as long as it takes.
I'm no fortune teller, and I don't care to make predictions on my 
rate of loss... Bad psychology... My blinders are on and all 
that &quot;rushing stuff&quot; is just an annoying blinker in my peripheral 

vision...What I *can* and always try to do, is to focus on the here 
and now.
I have lost weight before, and gained it back...
Three times to be precise...
I won't ever go back to that mindset, as seductive as it may be at 
times...
Never.

This time the real difference is I am changing me from the inside 
out. That's what counts and if it isn't fast, even better. Fast 
loss = eventual dissappointment somewhere down the line.... Usually 
it reverts into an even bigger gain than before.

&gt; it is : TURTLES GET THERE FAST


..Nope, &quot;ur&quot; not allowed..sorry :) I'm sticking with &quot;Turtles get 

there eventually&quot; To say &quot;Turtles get there *fast*&quot; screws up the 

entire, Aesops style metaphor/classic wisdom of the ages, I was 
trying to achieve here, and is, I must say &quot;oxymoronic&quot; 
The whole point of my most recent posts, and the fundamental premise 
of the NoS system, is slow, permanent &quot;Stick-to-it-ism&quot;
Slow = quality
Fast = quick fix mentality = impatience...
Not a good recipe for permanent success...

Stick with SLOW folks. It works, don't be duped into rushing. It's 
bad psychology remember :)
The spirtual benefits are way greater and the pressure is way 
lower :)
Love,
Deb
