I'm having a strange problem - every night I wake up around 3:00am and I'm thirsty. I 
also get up and use the bathroom. Then I suddenly get a strong snack craving. So I go 
in the kitchen and eat some kind of snack. Last night it was the last of a big bag of 
potato chips and small ice cream bar. Along with my diet soda. REALLY strange! I am 
totally sabotaging myself in my weight loss plan. This has been happening for a while 
almost every night. Anyone have any suggestions to what I can do about this? I have 
to keep these snack in the house for my husband and grandson or they will 
complain.

Oh, I decided last week that I will go ahead and do the nosdiet along with a 
food-combining plan. My digestive system seems to work better when I don't combine 
proteins and carbs. My first weekend on the nosdiet though didn't go well. I used it 
as an excuse to eat lots of snacks. Our church has donuts and pastries every Sunday 
morning, and I ended up eating two donuts and three cinnamon rolls (small ones). Not 
all at once, but, one after choir practice, then one after Sunday School and then the 
rest after church services were over. Then later at home I had dinner and then ate 
two small ice cream bars. I guess all because I COULD. Maybe the nosdiet isn't for 
me. I'll find out after this week. I am planning to eat melon or an apple 1/2 hour 
before each meal (food-combining suggestion), so maybe that will stem my snack 
cravings. I'm thinking also if I keep some melon cut up in the fridge this week, then 
if I wake up wanting a snack, I could make myself snack on melon. What 
do
ya'll think?

Teresa,
Good for you!!!! I love it when I really start to show 
improivements like that. Someone might say, &quot;So you didn't eat 
something to celebrate, big deal!&quot; But if you're anything like me 

and have the hardest struggle breaking a cycle like this it IS a BIG 
deal! You go girl!
I love christian fiction! What it your book called? When will you 
be sening it to the publisher? I have child in my first grade class 
whos mom is a christian fiction novelist and her latest book is due 
out this month! I'm really excited to read it! **shameless and 
unplanned plug*** Her Name is Jennifer Seest and her book is 
called &quot;No accident&quot;. :)
Keep up the hard work!!!!!
Saleta

What about vacation? (new)

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#vacation">http://www.nosdiet.com/#vacation</a>

Is this diet compatible with having
friends/family/a social life of any kind?

**************************************************

Traffic was way up in January. No big surprise really,
but nice.

Group membership: 76 -&gt; 92 (up 21%)
'OK' hits to homepage: 3499 -&gt; 6332 (up 81% from nov
high)

It's unlikely traffic will be that high again for a
while, because even it the query volume remains this
high (fueled by all the new diet related tv ads), I
can't afford to keep the adwords showing at a
sufficient rate to absorb it.

**************************************************

Hope the January joiners (and old timers) are doing
ok. Pipe up if you run into trouble.

Reinhard

Thank you to Dan and Tom for helping with my pilates/abs questions. I just bought the 
Windsor pilates tapes and was concerned that I had wasted my money.
