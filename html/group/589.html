Hello;

These are musings, not aimed at nosdiet, but at something that strikes me as funny 

in many diet or weightloss discussions. Ok, really it's just a semantic 
rant.

Efficiency is a good thing, yet people brag if they can eat all they want and not 
gain 
weight. In other words, their metabolism is inefficient. They are bragging about 

inefficiency. They want their body to be a fat-burning machine, to borrow some 

weightloss hype I heard somewhere. They want a metabolism that burns calories 

faster. That's like saying you want a car that burns more gas.

We know muscle burns more calories than fat. Now, saying that you want more 

muscle is a good thing. That is like saying you want a car that has more power. There 

is nothing wrong with that. The goal is power, not how much gas you can 
burn.

Not many people know this, but way back in evolutionary history there were modern 

human prototypes called sixpackanoids. They were just like us, the metabolically 

efficient lovehandlenoids, but whereas we could live on one deer a week per family, 

the sixpackanoids needed ten deer. Well, they're not around anymore. Ha!

So, don't say you want a body that burns more calories, say you want to be in better 

physical condition to live and enjoy life better. The rest will take care of 
itself.

Tom
