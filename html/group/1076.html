Mary try subtituting the water for Juice when you make oatmeal. I have
found I like it better and it doesn't need any sweetner artificial or
otherwise. Not so fast on the cereal and the granola bar. If it is
part of your meal and you really have to ask it probably isn't an S
unless it is something you have a problem with. The same goes for
that question about the pancakes and waffles. For me Syrup on my
pancakes is an S I use applesauce or peanutbutter instead. No S is
very individual. The only hard and fast rules are No seconds No
sweets and No Snacks. Your friend in health Melanie

&gt; I made regular oatmeal for breakfast yesterday and decided against
putting brown sugar in it -- I used a packet of splenda instead. 
&gt; 
&gt; Today is going fine so far. Breakfast and lunch have been
satisfying and not too much food (like dinner last night). 
&gt; 
&gt; I did realize last night that the reason I fail on every diet I have
been on is because some occasion will come up where I eat off plan
(usually vacation, but could be a holiday) and then have a hard time
getting back on plan. While off plan, I no longer have boundaries and
eat like there is no tomorrow. Consequently, by the time I get back
ON plan, I have gained back some, if not all, of the weight I had
lost. What I like about this plan is that the boundaries are very
clear and simple. No food is completely off limit and is never more
than 5 days away. 
&gt; 
&gt; So far, so good.
&gt; 
&gt; Mary
&gt; P.S. Chel -- glad to see you posting here. We will learn as we go!!

&gt; plan already!!!

&gt; &gt; Welcome, Chel. You're right; the granola bar is S. So is the box 

&gt; of cereal 
&gt; &gt; that you reminded me to give away.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Stay with it. You'll be glad you did.
