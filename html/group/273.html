As I mention on the site, peanut butter is one of
those borderline foods that might be a problem for
some, but is probably just fine for most people (it
sounds like it's a positive help to you, Kevin, eat on
with a clear conscience). Unless you're spooning it
out of the jar, I'd say it's probably more risky to
stress about avoiding it than it is to indulge in
moderation. For purists, there is also the &quot;healthy&quot;
sugarless peanut butter, which I have to admit is not
my favorite, at least not when purchased prepackaged.
But the supermarket near me has a machine that grinds
the peanuts into butter in front of your eyes (just
one ingredient!), a process which so impresses me
that I've managed to convince myself that I do in fact
like the stuff. Honestly, though, I don't think it
would fare so well in a *blind* taste test.

Brooke, sorry I missed you on the last welcome email.
Welcome! Sounds like you're ramping up nicely.

&gt; Ginny, at least you made it to 11:00! WE went to bed
&gt; at 10. Talk about 
&gt; getting old!! ha Anyway, we are doing better on the
&gt; no s thing, although we still 
&gt; have snacks now and again, they are much fewer and
&gt; far between and we are more 
&gt; conscious about how much we both eat at one sitting.
&gt; I think by this time next 
&gt; week, we will both be snacking only in moderation on
&gt; weekends. This is our 
&gt; goal for the new year.
&gt; Take care,
&gt; Brooke
