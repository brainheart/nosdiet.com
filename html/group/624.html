Hi Hana,

I'm about as far from being a doctor as you can get
(and I wouldn't submit to medical advice from anyone
on this or any other internet group no matter who they
claimed to be). Given your condition, you really need
to (physically!) speak with a medical professional
about possible weight related side effects from your
medications and this or any other diet.

That being said, slow movement in the right direction
is better than no movement or wrong movement. And if
you're seeing progress in terms of how clothes fit and
people's responses, that is something. And remember,
for a lifetime habit, a week is just a blip. I imagine
as a person with serious medical issues, you'd kind of
want to take it slow. 

Best of luck, talk to your doctor, and keep us posted,

Reinhard

&gt; poor appetite, I

&gt; less than a pound a

&gt; specialist instructor 
&gt; and do Pilates each week. My diabetes care nurse
&gt; thinks I might be 
&gt; building muscle and replacing fat.My clothes are
&gt; definitely looser, 
&gt; but the numbers on the scales are disappointing.Does
&gt; anyone have any 
&gt; helpful ideas? could my medication be having
&gt; unwanted effects? I am 
&gt; on anti hypertensives, statins and antidiabetic
&gt; drugs.
