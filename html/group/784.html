Hi Kitrin,

The critical thing for the first day(s) is to give
yourself sufficiently generous portions. Don't be
overambitious, just try to stick with the rules, and
assume that'll take big firsts. It's easier to
gradually adjust portions downwards than recover from
hunger induced off the books snacking. This is
especially important since you say that grazing rather
than sweets or seconds is your big issue. Don't risk
the habit for a one time calorie loss. That's like
risking a steady job for found money. Habit formation
has to come first.

By the same token, be careful about drastically
cutting coffee/tea at the same time. Succeeding at
something realistic is infinitely preferable to
failing at something perfect. I've developed a taste
for black coffee and tea without sugar or sweetener.
You might want to give that a try. If that sounds
disgusting to you, do try to make sure you have *some*
replacement beverage on hand to pinch hit. Nothing
beats water, if you can get away with it. Tricks for
making water more palatable that have been suggested
in this group include squeezing in a lemon and
drinking it out of fancy bottles (psychological, yes,
but so are we). Drink before you get thirsty, because
thirst is often misinterpreted as hunger and that
might not play out so well.

If you're not into sugar cereal or pop tarts for
breakfast, I don't think you'll have much trouble
coming up with *what* to eat, that's one of the charms
of this diet. But do bug us if you're stumped. 

Good luck, and keep us posted,

Reinhard

&gt; My plan is to start full swing tomorrow morning. I
&gt; have already been 
&gt; watching my portions and my grazing in the last few
&gt; weeks but have 
&gt; not been so as strict as I should. I know I eat
&gt; more than I should, 
&gt; mostly through grazing. My meals tend to be small so
&gt; I will have to 
&gt; try bigger meals to start off with to curb that need
&gt; to graze.
&gt; Sweets are not really an issue for me. I will be
&gt; cutting my coffee 
&gt; and tea intake to try to reduce my sugar intake
&gt; though as i drink at 
&gt; least a full pot of both a day (an IV and liquid
&gt; caffination would 
&gt; be much simpler no?)
&gt; Any words of advice to make it through the first
&gt; day? Food 
&gt; suggestions?
