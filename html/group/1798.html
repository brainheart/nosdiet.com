Uh oh guys! Frankenstein is going to be knocking on your door 
Sunday...What's a NOSser to do, as a candy-limiting parent, when 
it's Halloween?
Folks....Who can honestly say that they didn't *really* look 
forwards to all the candy from trick-or-treating, when you were a 
kid? I can't...It probably was my favorite holiday of the year, 
next to Thanksgiving (again with the food!)
I don't want to be a spoilsport with my son Richard, who is 
*already* looking forward to accumulating wealths of treats...One 
year, our candy lasted till mid Spring! But I also don't want to 
have a constant battle over how much he can have during the week, 
how much to keep altogether, etc...Plus, quite frankly, I don't want 
the temptation of having a dufflebag of candy and chocolates around 
for me either...Last year, I allowed Richard two candies an 
evening. They were small &quot;snack size&quot; ones...But I would not want 

him to have that much now, and in retrospect, that was really alot, 
and it is clearly not within NOS living rules.... Saying No to my 
sons very few pleasures is something I hate having to do...He is not 
a greedy child or spoiled at all... Any constructive feedback on 
troubleshooting this candy conundrum people?
Live Long and Prosper :)
Love,
Deb
