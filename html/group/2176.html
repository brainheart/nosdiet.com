&gt; Hi everyone!
&gt; I usually am a lurker, but have decided to come out of lurk-dome to
&gt; ask a question that has been bothering me for some time about 
hunger and fullness approaches to eating. BTW, I have had success 
using the No-S plan, and am convinced it is the most sane approach 
to eating out there!

....Hi Sunshine, I wish you would come out these days, as it is a 
dreary November so far and I could use some rays!
I am happy to hear that you are &quot;coming out&quot; of your lurkdom, I 

think it's much more fun to take an active role in this group, and 
I'm sure you've noticed that I have been pretty much monopolizing 
the posts! LOL Lurkdom is such a limbo state, so please don't go 
back there :)
Anyway, I don't really know much about &quot;hunger/fullness&quot; diets, per 

se, but I do have some thoughts about hunger in general...
Firstly, it's really ok for the stomach to be empty sometimes, and 
any diet which touts, &quot;you won't be hungry&quot; and &quot;you can eat all 

day&quot; etc. *I* feel is kind of disrespecting the body... In 
addition, our hunger signals, if we are not taking in enough water 
(somewhere in the 6 -8 glasses or so I've heard) can actually be 
thirst indicators in the guise of food hunger... Then we go and 
satisfy thirst with some sort of liquidy food, like fruits, or a 
piece of pie, when in fact we should just go to the non-caloric 
source: water....
The other thing to keep in mind, which I wrote about in a past post, 
was about how our brains sense food....Unfortunately, our stomachs 
can be getting full but our brain, usually takes between 10 -20 mins 
to really get the fullness effect...Therefore, if one eats until 
they feel satiated, they may actually be overeating... the natural 
remedy for that is slow down the food chewing, really take it in and 
just eat slower. 
As far as a &quot;diet&quot; the fullness/emptiness model lacks structure, and 

there's really no plan.... Obviously, our bodies are very dynamic, 
and *shouldn't* be simply depositories of the same amount of every 
day &quot;calories&quot;...some days you burn more, some days you burn less... 

Sometimes you have a bad appetite... It's just good to have NoS 
guidelines for the days when the appetites predictability factor is 
not so predictable...It's nice when you do honor your body, and 
respect it's signals, but for those of us with overeating 
tendencies, I believe it's good not to be too vague as to leave 
things with no plan other than &quot;eat when hungry&quot;... I guess if I had 

a clearer idea of the way you structured your eating with 
this &quot;fullness diet&quot; I would have even more constructive advise to 

offer, but I think you probably know the answer yourself, as you 
sound like your head is on very straight :) If you are interested 
in that post on hunger and the brain, it's somewhere in the early 
September posts :)
Peace,
Debbie
