Don't beat yourself up about slipping off the diet. I've been doing
the no-s-diet for almost two years now. I've had plenty of slip-ups.
The nice thing is that I was easily able to get back in line again.
For me, the past two months or so have had way too many extra s-days
(I'm not allowed to turn down my aunts' holiday desserts!) But the
past two weeks have been stellar no-s weeks and I've had much luck
avoiding the abundance of chocolate at work.

Don't worry about slipping off the diet. Just focus that energy (I
find that I feel a lot of self-pity when I slip up) in to challenging
yourself to stick to it... again. We're not going to punish you and
there is no need to punish yourself.

So, welcome back to the no-s-diet!

&gt; This is what always happens to me on a diet, and I hate it. A few

&gt; discouragement. Then a few weeks spent looking for the next diet.
&gt;
&gt; I'm sick of it! I love the No-S diet, its elegance, its simplicity,
&gt; its adaptability to anyone's real life. I want to return to it.
&gt;
&gt; I read about Atkins, that you have one &quot;golden chance&quot;, that if 
you
&gt; slip and try to return, you won't be successful. You blew it.
&gt;
&gt; I refuse to believe it. Certainly my will can direct me to any diet
&gt; I choose. Anyone agree? Anyone deviate from the diet and then
&gt; return to renewed success?
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks in advance.
