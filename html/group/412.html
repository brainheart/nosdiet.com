Hi Joy,

I think you've gotten some good advice already, which
I'm basically just going to re-iterate.

You mention that you wake up thirsty, and then wind up
eating. It's interesting (and positive) that you even
notice this because thirst can easily be confused for
hunger. If you keep this in mind and drink up, your
hunger really should diminish.

As for the junk in the house, if you can't get rid of
it, could you at least ask your husband and grandson
to keep their stash somewhere less in your face? Ice
cream might be difficult, but chips and cookies don't
need a refrigerator. They can easily be stashed
somewhere less conspicuous (or even better, hidden!).
Let them know how important it is. If even this isn't
feasible, you have to draw a firm line. If it can't
physically be gone then it has to be psychologically
completely off limits. This is really hard, but I
don't think there's an alternative (which is why
persuading your family is really the better way to go
if at all possible).

As for the excessive S-days, don't worry too much
about that right now. It will happen in the beginning
(and even occasionally later on). It's just not that
important, in the grand scheme of things. The daily
chips and ice-cream and 3 am snacks are a far more
important issue. That's what you've got to focus your
limited resources on.

Fruit is certainly much better than junk, but I'd be
wary about eating too much between meals. It can be an
excuse to make those meals extra junky.

Good luck!

Reinhard

&gt; I'm having a strange problem - every night I wake up
&gt; around 3:00am and I'm thirsty. I also get up and
&gt; use the bathroom. Then I suddenly get a strong
&gt; snack craving. So I go in the kitchen and eat some
&gt; kind of snack. Last night it was the last of a big
&gt; bag of potato chips and small ice cream bar. Along
&gt; with my diet soda. REALLY strange! I am totally
&gt; sabotaging myself in my weight loss plan. This has
&gt; been happening for a while almost every night. 
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions to what I can do about
&gt; this? I have to keep these snack in the house for
&gt; my husband and grandson or they will complain.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, I decided last week that I will go ahead and do
&gt; the nosdiet along with a food-combining plan. My
&gt; digestive system seems to work better when I don't
&gt; combine proteins and carbs. My first weekend on the
&gt; nosdiet though didn't go well. I used it as an
&gt; excuse to eat lots of snacks. Our church has donuts
&gt; and pastries every Sunday morning, and I ended up
&gt; eating two donuts and three cinnamon rolls (small
&gt; ones). Not all at once, but, one after choir
&gt; practice, then one after Sunday School and then the
&gt; rest after church services were over. Then later at
&gt; home I had dinner and then ate two small ice cream
&gt; bars. I guess all because I COULD. Maybe the
&gt; nosdiet isn't for me. I'll find out after this
&gt; week. I am planning to eat melon or an apple 1/2
&gt; hour before each meal (food-combining suggestion),
&gt; so maybe that will stem my snack cravings. I'm
&gt; thinking also if I keep some melon cut up in the
&gt; fridge this week, then if I wake up wanting a snack,
&gt; I could make myself snack on melon. What do
&gt; ya'll think?

&gt; Teresa,
&gt; Good for you!!!! I love it when I really start to
&gt; show 
&gt; improivements like that. Someone might say, &quot;So you
&gt; didn't eat 
&gt; something to celebrate, big deal!&quot; But if you're
&gt; anything like me 
&gt; and have the hardest struggle breaking a cycle like
&gt; this it IS a BIG 
&gt; deal! You go girl!
&gt; I love christian fiction! What it your book called?
&gt; When will you 
&gt; be sening it to the publisher? I have child in my
&gt; first grade class 
&gt; whos mom is a christian fiction novelist and her
&gt; latest book is due 
&gt; out this month! I'm really excited to read it!
&gt; **shameless and 
&gt; unplanned plug*** Her Name is Jennifer Seest and her
