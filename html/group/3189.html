&gt; Way to go Deb.....I am so proud of you , and what great news for a 

Monday morning yet! All the Best is yet to come,,,,
Bonnie

Thanks a lot Ron-bon-da-doo-ron-ron!
I am pretty proud too :) I am STILL sick though... Jeez! Going on 8 
weeks now.. My next door neighbor told me his wife was ill with this 
virus for TEN weeks... Well, once I am totally back to normal health, 
I am really going to crank up the exercise volume and walk every day...
I'm just very winded now, and have a hard time doing anything.. even 
breathing and talking are totally belabored....Rah! I'm po'd....
This too will pass, as did the mind numbing bordom and cold dark 
depression of the Winter... (can you tell I don't like Winter? LOL)
Good luck this week guys.. I need to get a job for the afternoons, and 

then find a new place for Richard and I to live, as my mom is finally 
going to bite the bullet and sell her house this Summer... plus we are 

at each others throats nearly every day, and I am well beyond my 
breaking point being in such close proximity, with such a tense 
relationship... I thank God every day that, at least one thing in my 
life is going right now... NoS has been and will continue to be a 
saving grace in an otherwise, very tumultuous existence...
(how philosophical.. but I really mean it,,, seriously!)
PS Did you all go over to Atkins or some other group? LOL! 
22 messages on the posts? Ah probably out jogging and mountain 
climbing or something, right? ... Oh wait, people do tend to have 
jobs.. That's probably it :) Still, it's beginning to feel like a NoS 
host town folks, so speak up! I'm getting sick of reading my own posts 

for entertainment... There's something less satisfying about saying to 

oneself &quot;Go me go!&quot;... LOL... Thanks Bon, again.. You are like 

the &quot;positive&quot; mom I need right now :) Love ya!
Who's still NoSSing?
:)
Have a fandiddley-tastic daydiddleydoo!
LOL...
Debbillydiddley :)
