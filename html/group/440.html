wow . I was amazed but the overweight photo of Adkins and Dr. Phil
-just never noticed before! Dr. Weil always does look like Santa, but his
diet is healthy, if only he did no S along with it.
The other thing I want to add is for the lady that needed a pick me up,which
is safe as can be, is a cup of no caffeine (it is always no caffeine anyway)
peppermint tea, and it is good for you as well. Also a bit of cinnamon 
added
to your food every so often revs you up. I am a high energy 60 year old, 
so
I can say if it works for me....and they say even if you can only get 7
minutes of exercise in a day it is way better than none at all. I work 
from
morn to dusk as well between my shop, home, art, Golden Retrievers, and 
the
love of my life, husband of 40+years. Kids are grown, but one can always 
be
too busy for exercise! When the weather is better my husband and neighbor
and I walk for 30-45 minutes, we just get up a little earlier!
We love that however, and find the time!
Bonnie

great reinhard 
! I have some friends who are doing the atkins diet and have triumpanhtly
told me how fast the pounds dropped - I bet they are not as loud when they
start gaining again

I'm sure you've all seen this already, but just in
case:

From:

<a href="http://story.news.yahoo">http://story.news.yahoo</a>
com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=594&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/20040211/hl_nm/health_atkins_dc

&quot;The records, a copy of which was sent to Reuters,
show Atkins weighed 258 pounds when he died, which
would clearly have made the 6-foot-tall medical doctor
not just overweight but obese.

They also show he had a history of heart disease,
including a chronic condition known as heart failure,
high blood pressure and heart attack. Heart failure
can cause fluid retention, but Atkins was by any
measure at least 75 pounds overweight when he died at
age 72.&quot;

I hate to gloat over a dead guy, but I figured there
had to be a reason he's always wearing a baggy suit in
pictures. What's with diet gurus and baggy
suits/abundant facial hair? Check out the following
pictures of bestselling diet guru's (from the covers
of their books!):

Dr. Weil (santa beard -- and gut?)

Dr. Phil (baggy suit)

Atkins (suit, doesn't even fit in the picture)

If the prospect of millions of dollars in sales can't
inspire you to lose weight, what can? But I guess they
figured (rightly, sadly) that suckers will pay even
so.
