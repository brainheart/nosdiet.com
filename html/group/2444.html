Thats awesome Heidi, great job!!!

I haven't done well this week, I have been sick (bad head cold) and so have fallen 
into the mentality that i deserve sweets because I don't feel good. Not a good way to 
think. :) But I'm not going to give up! My husband has been doing NoS with me (though 
he bends the rules just a bit lol, where as I just flat out break them lol) and I 
noticed today that he is looking thinner. Its amazing how just a few simple changes 
in our eating habits make a huge difference. 

Thats all for me, have a great weekend everyone!

Carrie :)

And I did pretty well! I've read that many of you don't weigh in, but that's one WW 
habit I haven't come to hate (yet!). I lost 3.5 pounds 

I am proud to say that I didn't break the Sweets rule, I wasn't sure if I'd last 
through the week on that one... I have a wicked sweet tooth after meals!

I didn't cheat except for one thing- I had 4 meals yesterday. I couldn't help it, I 
was just starving and knew I wouldn't make it! I figured a &quot;meal&quot; (sandwich 
and chips) was far better than a mad snacking fest.

Now I'm looking forward to tomorrow, when I can celebrate with some ice cream... 
(hard habit to break!!)

How is everyone else doing??

Heidi
