Hi Jackie,

I don't have the nutritional information in front of
me, but Slim Fast is pretty much garbage. It's got a
ton of high fructose corn syrup, a tiny smidge of
protein, and some vitamins. 

High fructose corn syrup is, quite simply, garbage.
It's more lypolitic (fat producing) than table
sugar(!) and sneakier, too--it's an ingredient of many
processed foods. There's a bunch of technical details
about why HFCS is bad (if you're curious, I can
explain), but just count it as a sweet, okay? 

Slim Fast is basically a Sprite or Coke with vitamins
added. And a Sprite counts as sugar, so I say &quot;no&quot;. 

My version of a fast breakfast:

1/2 cup whole rolled oats (do NOT substitute instant)
1 cup frozen berries (any kind, or mixed)
1-2 scoops of protein powder (whey or casein based,
preferably--any flavor: vanilla works with everything
and chocolate is good with raspberries)
Water to taste.

Prep time: 2-4 minutes, total.

Throw the 1/2 cup of oats in the microwave with a cup
of water for two minutes on high. Stir in 1 cup
berries. Add protein powder, and water to dissolve. It
will form a nice porridge that's not too hot or too
cold, and is quite sweet. It's packed with fiber and
phytochemicals (non-vitamin substances that have
antioxidant properties) and protein. All of which will
kill hunger better than the Slim Fast. 

You can also throw all this stuff in a blender and
drink it. Add more water--and ice, possibly--and cook
the oats first. This makes it a more portable
breakfast. 

Use different berries on different days to really get
good effects from this breakfast. 

On the fruit issue:
I like to eat frozen (or fresh, if they're in season)
berries with a bit of fresh whipped cream (just a bit)
for a nice dessert. Don't go overboard on the cream,
but it makes it more &quot;dessert-like&quot; without really
messing you up too much. This is a good way to serve a
dessert. You can also add milk to the frozen berries
for a quick, interesting dessert. (I also add protein
powder--but then again, I'm kinda nutty.)

Anyway, a bit of rumination from a diet-wars veteran.
(I've lost about 50 lbs. of fat and kept it off.)

hope this helps,

Dan

&gt; My name is Jackie, and I have just a few short
&gt; questions. Before I started 
&gt; this nosdiet, just a few days ago, I was on a low
&gt; calorie diet befor this, and 
&gt; sort of still am. (but I love the &quot;except for days
&gt; that start with S thing!) 
&gt; ha!, Except now I need to know, is slim fast for
&gt; breakfast out? Not that I mind 
&gt; or anything, just need to know sense it is sweet.
&gt; And my husband also is on 
&gt; this diet, and he was wanting to know about &quot;no
&gt; sugar&quot; deserts. I really don't 
&gt; have a problem not eating for breakfast or lunch,
&gt; but I know I need to eat 
&gt; something, that is sort of why the slim fast was
&gt; working for me. Although how 
&gt; about the breakfast hot pocket sort of things? I
&gt; don't have a clue what I'm doing. 
&gt; HELP!
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jackie
