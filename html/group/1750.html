hi guys
I made myself a promise that I would post no matter what. I've found in 
the
past that I will write in a diary for example, when things are going well.
well, everything was ok till late this afternoon at work. and I had a small
packet of crisps.
but all day I was thinking about how I'd go off the rails when I got home.
I had thought to myself that I would email now, around dinner time, each
night cos it is my difficult time and thinking of you and your successes
would help keep me on track. I still think it will, but today isn't the 
day.
I am about to go for a walk, and I hope I will come home to just one meal,
but I doubt it.
I will not berate myself, but I get worried and puzzled that I have trouble
building a 3 wk habit (ie it is only day one).
things were muddled so breakfast (yoghurt &amp; sunflower seeds and a little
flaxseed oil) wasn't till about 10.30. I had thought I was meeting a friend
for lunch but that's tomorrow, so I hadn't bought any lunch with me.
Then work was busy and I bought a sandwich and kransky sausage at about
3.45.
So I know that this all doesn't help - cos it isn't the ideal.
Group I need you, and I have promised myself I will post each day til I 
get
the 3 weeks up. I hope you can bear it.
bye for now
jen
