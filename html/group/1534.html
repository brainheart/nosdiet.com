Hi everyone!

(I'm cross posting this to both lists, so apologies if you are subscribed to 

both)

Today is my 3 week mark for nosdiet. I've dropped 4 pounds and can see a 

visible difference on my face and waist. This is easily the best eating 

regime I've ever been on, and (fortunately) it has not been a difficult one 

for me. 

I expected it to be very hard - I have a very sweet tooth. But I have been 

surprised at how easy it has been to refuse sweets &amp; snacks when offered me. 

I have made very sure that each of my main meals have been enough to tide me 

over for five hours. I make sure that I am satisfied at the end of each meal 

(not 'full to overflowing', but comfortably satisfied) at it has worked!

I've also been shovelgloving every day (although not this week - eeek! I need 

to get back in the saddle). I'm only using a 7lb hammer, and I didn't think 

that I would ever get used to it, but just over a week into it and there was 

no particular problems.

My SG routine is:

Drive Fenceposts	21-14-7
Churn Butter	14-7 (single arms)
Shovelling	21-14
No Name	14-7
Chop Wood	21-14
Hoist the Sack	14-7
Stoke the Oven	21-14
Tuck the Bales	21-14

As you can see, I am able to just get through the second circuit and start on 

the third set of fenceposts when the 14 minutes are up. I'm able to do this 

without sucking wind any more, although my forearms are nicely tight at the 

end. 

I find it very pleasant to fold my arms and think &quot;yep - that's a bicep&quot;. 

Never done that before!

I think I'll move up to a 10lb hammer in a few weeks. (I just got paid, so 

I'll make a trip to Wickes).

I'm also Urban Rangering - about half an hour a day during the week, and then 

one session of an hour to an hour and a half at the weekend (normally 
Saturday). Every little helps!

Thanks Reinhard! These systems have been an absolute revelation!
