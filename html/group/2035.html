&gt; &gt; HI Deb, Neal will be 43 this month.He hit is &quot;peak&quot; about 10 

years ago, 
....Some people would say 26 years ago (scary)

and now i am at mine. 
....Lett'er'rip!

so he keeps yapping about the 84 bite diet. I am ready 
to slap him
.....tolerance Jools, it might be annoying, but maybe NoS is just as 
annoying to him. Still, you should start the slapping now.

the guys were laughing at him in the shop about it.
....Ha ha....

Some people will believe anything. 
....A sucker is born every five minutes, and the faddist diets prey 
on their willingness to subscribe to whatever they are 
peddling...But like your &quot;favorite quote&quot; says, in a slightly 

different context, what was it again?, &quot;the bitter taste of poor 
quality lingers long after the sweet taste of finding a bargain is 
gone&quot; or something along those lines....
Once he realizes that it is a major drag to have to count to 84 all 
day long, how long do you think he will keep it up? Will that 
quickie fix answer bring him long term success? Well, sometimes it 
takes experimentation with all the crap out there, and having your 
hopes lifted so high, only to come plummetting down to reality, to 
realize if they are truly helpful...The proof is in the pudding.

We may go out to Carrabas tonight, 
&gt; hungry for calamari.I will see if he counts his bites without 
&gt; slobbering all over himself.
....Please take a picture :)

Have a wonderful night of celebration, I wish I could join you 
because calamari sounds really good!
Peace and Love,
Deb :)
