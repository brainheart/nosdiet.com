Dear Tom,
Thanks for the great letter, you are an inspiration to us all. You are
right that the weight loss is slow, or at least for me as well, but the 
key
word is loss, not gain. I've been at it a while and 7 pounds
lighter, and my husband now 23 pounds less. As you also said it sure does
save money! We also cut down, not cut out, the pasta potatoes and bread. 
It
works better for us, but if we want a burger and bun, or pizza on occasions,
so what, we eat! 
Sincerely, Bonnie

Hello;

Since it has been so quiet I guess it's a good time for me to start babbling
uninterrupted.

I started at the beginning of the year and I still think nos is the best
thing since they 
invented sliced bread, I mean celery. Wow, I must have lost tons! How many
pounds in two 
and a half months!?

Uh, not much. Up until last week maybe 5 or 6 pounds, but according to 
the
scale this 
morning, maybe 2 or 3. That doesn't sound too impressive. The point is I 
don
t care.

I follow nos strictly. Reinhard is right about the fence thing - use it 
on
this diet, and use it 
everywhere else in life. It makes decisions much more clear, and right. 


I look forward to weekends but when they are over I always look back and
notice that I 
probably didn't eat much more than the weekdays. I'm too busy doing weekend
stuff.

I work out lightly most weekday mornings, using bodyweight exercises and
some weights. 
Three times a week I work out aerobicly, often bordering on anaerobicly 
for
short spurts. I 
do a variation of shovelglove several times a week - I dig out the basement,
pot plants, 
widen the driveway embankment. That is combined with some wheelbarrowglove.

Here's what I'm happy about, and makes me not care about the pound count. 
I
m saving a 
whole bunch of money on (not my auto insurance) snack foods. I used to 
buy
big supplies 
of nuts and fruits for snacking at work. I figure I must be saving at least
10 - 15 bucks a 
week. That ain't peanuts for me 'cause I'm a schoolteacher.

Here is another reason: I don't waste time using my hands to stuff stuff
down my mouth. I 
eat three times a day and that's that. Period. What a timesaver. My garage
is almost 
cleaned!

If my body doesn't want to lose weight, tough. It's only getting what I 
give
it on nos - no 
more. There is some more good news. My belt went in a notch, and although 
my
scale this 
morning said I might have gotten a few pounds back, the notch stays
comfortably where it 
is. I feel good. But then, I always have.

I've written pounds here, but they are converted from kilos. For those 
of
you who are 
utterly dismayed at the numbers on your scale, do what I do. Use a metric
scale. You won't 
be nearly so heavy.

So, keep on the nos, make it work, don't worry about time, don't worry 
about
numbers, 
save money, putter around the house, increase free time, clean your garage,
and I think I'll 
shut up now.

Tom
