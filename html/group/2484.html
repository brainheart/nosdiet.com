.....Hmmm,,, it's pretty hard to know how to reply to *that* but I 
will say...Thanks for sharing! LOL :)
Well they do say, &quot;an apple a day keeps the doctor away&quot;...
Then again, if you really want to get the &quot;pipes&quot; percolating, 

there's an acupuncture point in the webbing between the thumb and 
index finger, which you push on at a 90degree angle to the 2nd 
metacarpal (finger bone on index finger) which should do the 
trick... It's nickname translated from Chinese, is called, 
appropriately, &quot;The Great Eliminator&quot;, and is Large Intestine point 

#4....
It also gets rid of headaches! 

Well this has been a totally off plan week, and I can't wait for 
this month to be over....My mom left 2 pints of ice cream around the 
other day (after I had a fight with her, lovely!) and of course 
Richard and I had non stop ice cream for the next 48 hours....which 
actually gave us both gas (not to be too indelicate!)
Could I be getting intolerant to this junk food? In a way I almost 
hope that the answer is yes, but really I think it might have been 
the very end of that virus.... On a small triumphant note, the other 
day at work, there was a sweet sixteen spa party, and I had 3 half 
hour massages in a row.. Got pretty fatigued and hungry about 1 hour 
before I could leave, needed a pick me up.. there were some cans of 
coke laying around and I was so compelled to drink some, for a quick 
fix of sugar and caffeine.... but I thought, this is bad mental 
programming, and let me look for something less detrimental to my 
health... I had a half a cup of sparkling grape juice instead! Yay 
me :)
This sparkly stuff with juice, is really a great alternative to 
soda... I have been seltzering at home with a splash of juice for 
flavor and I think it's very satisfying. Try it!
Hope all yall are having fun, and no one is &quot;clogged up&quot; LOL 
:)

Please someone write something soon, I am going into post 
withdrawal! LOL :)
How about some post holiday battle stories? :)
Peace and Love,
Deb
PS.. Hana what is a Sharon fruit? Your story is now inextricably 
linked to this fruit for me now, I'm not sure if I could eat one 
without laughing :)
