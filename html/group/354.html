Welcome back, ceridwenhurdle. Sometimes it takes a
false start. Try to learn something from it, to
fortify your second attempt. There usually is
something to learn.

The corporations have finally realized that the low
carb craze could be even more profitable than the low
fat craze. It seems like every fast food joint now has
a low carb offering, fresh from the labs of New
Jersey. With all those ad dollars behind it, I'm not
surprised that half your neighbors are on one of these
diets and/or talking about it all the time. Just
remember how successful the last craze was, and
silently enjoy your meal. Ever notice that there
doesn't seem to be a very strong positive correlation
(to put it mildly) between sticking with a diet and
talking about it non-stop? How nice, as you point out,
that the nosdiet makes it easy to avoid that trap.

As for breakfast, if you have a fridge, you can do
cold cereal. I guess that's not so portable, though...
I'm big on cheese and black bread, but that's a weird
German thing, and again, not quite pop-tart portable
(close, though). You've heard my panegyrics to fruit,
but that's not a breakfast in itself. Could you try to
give yourself a little extra time? You'll save it
again by avoiding a mid-morning snack, you'll have
many more options to consider, variety in what you do
wind up eating, and you'll enjoy it more. If you only
get 3 meals, after all, try to take a little time to
enjoy them.

&gt; Good night--I didn't check this board for month and,
&gt; well, I've been 
&gt; swamped trying to catch up! I've skipped a several
&gt; weeks at a time 
&gt; before and get a few messages behind, but
&gt; wow--traffic has really 
&gt; picked up around here. That's awesome! It's so
&gt; encouraging to hear 
&gt; how everyone is doing. (but goodness, killing/eating
&gt; lumberjacks? --
&gt; actually that really helped me understand!) 
&gt; 
&gt; I've been not so diligent recently (like since
&gt; October...eek) so, I'm 
&gt; back at it again!! I noticed results Aug-Oct when I
&gt; was more faithful 
&gt; so I know it's possible, and that I'll be pleased
&gt; and feel better. I 
&gt; manage not to snack much at all, and am trying not
&gt; to go overboard on 
&gt; my S-days. I'm really struggling with breakfast,
&gt; though. I don't have 
&gt; a kitchen (in a dorm room) and don't have time to
&gt; run to the 
&gt; cafeteria before class... so I end up eating a pack
&gt; of peanut-butter-
&gt; on-toasty-crackers and a bottle of water sometime
&gt; before lunch. That 
&gt; doesn't count as breakfast, does it? Any suggestions
&gt; for something 
&gt; that is quick, portable, and doesn't require
&gt; cooking? (Yes, people 
&gt; like me are the reason the pop-tart industry
&gt; flourishes)
&gt; 
&gt; As an aside, over break I was with my family,
&gt; several of whom are 
&gt; doing Atkins. They're losing weight, of course, and
&gt; I'm not going to 
&gt; sit around and argue with them. I'm glad to see them
&gt; happy. BUT, at 
&gt; every meal--*EVERY* meal!--they talked about the
&gt; diet. And if one ate 
&gt; a bite of pancake or potato--well, &quot;I'm splurging
&gt; this time, it's no 
&gt; big deal.&quot; I don't think I like hearing people
&gt; justify their food 
&gt; choices. Just eat what you want (within guidelines,
&gt; duh), for 
&gt; goodness sake, and enjoy it! This is why I love the
&gt; no-S. I never 
&gt; even have to tell people I'm dieting--I can just
&gt; politely refuse 
&gt; dessert because I'm full.
&gt; 
&gt; It's good to be back on the no-S!
