I too have diabetes and last summer suffered a stroke. I have been dieting
for a few weeks and not losing a thing. My sugars are perfect and my last
HbA1c pleased my doctor. I go to the gym twice a week and to a Pilates
studio once. I'm finding the diet quite easy, but the lack of success
frustrating.

&gt; hello out there...you are not alone....
&gt; I have been dieting since February 15 and lost 9 pounds...
&gt; I have dieted different ways for many years off and on..
&gt; I have sugar diabetes..had it for over a year and half...if you don't 
do
something about your eating habits now..you will pay for it later.. I have
found a way before I discovered this site..that goes along with what I'm
doing...
&gt; When I was first diagnosed with diabetes.. I take pills for this...I 
got
my sugar under control at first..then I ate like I used to.. can't do it..my
sugar skyrocketed up to 200-300 for several months..which is very very
bad..all that sugar free stuff is very misleading..except for the jello 
and
diet drinks.
&gt; Well I printed out some pages starting with 8am to 9pm and I write 
down
what I eat on each time slot.. I love potato chips and bread dearly but 
for
6 weeks I did without them..Within that time frame, my sugar dropped down 
to
the 90's -115..which is wonderful and has stayed there.. so I had to make 
a
decision for my health.. I definitely don't eat sweets, snacks or
seconds...which I was doing before I found this website and I agree with
it.. NOW I do watch my carbs..
&gt; but you can't cut them out completely..you have to spread them out 
thru
the day ..so last week I ate a turkey sandwich..with 2 slices of 35 calorie
wheat bread and 12 baked lays potato chips...yum..I coulda ate more but 
not
worth my life...a once a day thing and not always every day... I love to
munch... so I have 1/cup nuts with a diet soda and eat slowly... I also 
buy
the turkey bacon and microwave it..til its crisp...in my mind its like 
a
flavored potato chip...works for me and is a lot better for me. I have 
a
notebook full of pages of my eating habits for the past 6 weeks so
far...write what you eat down..look at it.. make adjustments...write down
what works for you that day or if it didnt work.. I also made a place on
that sheet for 8 glasses of water.. I check off every space for 1 cup of
water I drink...sometimes I drink 10 glasses...water is very very important
especially if you eat a lot of proteins..Im walking a mile every day
down..using a cane...I'm 56... diabeti
&gt; c,
&gt; glaucoma, hyper tension, rheumatoid arthritis, I've had back surgery 
and
my diet affects all of this and these problems affect each other..so don't
wait til its a half to case.. Good luck...its not easy but its the way 
to
go...its a decision only YOU can make....Carol

&gt; Hello everyone. Well, I haven't posted here again because I figured 
that
the noS diet wouldn't work for me. On my first weekend, I ate like a total
pig. I wasn't able to keep myself from snacking, and put the 2 lbs I had
lost right back on. For me, it's difficult to stop with one little snack.
You know like with Lays potato chips - you can't eat just one. Well, I'm
that way with LOTS of types of snacks. However, I am going to try REALLY
HARD to get back onto this plan. Since I can eat some fruit - and I love
fruit - then maybe I can handle it. I'll just have to follow the rules 
more
closely. I also try to stay away from carbs as much as possible. Bread 
and
pasta are binge triggers for me. A couple of baked potatoes a week probably
will be okay. But honestly it doesn't take much to get me snacking
indiscriminately. :( Last night I got up at 3:00 in the morning and had 
a
snack cake. I have those snack cakes in the house for my grandson's lunch.
I try to get him
&gt; to eat
&gt; fruit instead of cookies or snack cakes, but he doesn't eat fruit 
well.
I'll have to work on it some more with him. But he is a little underweight,
so I really don't want to put him on any kind of a diet that will keep 
him
from putting on weight. Why is it that food is such a stressor???!!!
Anyway, everyone keep me in your thoughts as I am going to give this
another try. I'm kind of desperate to find a way of eating healthfully 
that
will work for me and my husband. I really need to lose at least 20 pounds.

&gt;
&gt; I am the disgusting slovenly pig who made the suggestion about starting
&gt; on a noS day. I discovered the website on a Saturday and made a decision
&gt; to start on Monday. During the weekend, I had a lot of time to pay
&gt; attention to my eating habits, which was useful in and of itself; I 
also
&gt; was able to think about what I wanted to eat and how I was going to
&gt; manage my meals come Monday. I am prone to hyperbole; sorry if I
&gt; offended anyone.

&gt;
&gt; You didn't offend me. In fact yesterday I was beating myself up for
&gt; being piggy. In fact I found this website by punching in the words 
I
&gt; am fat on my search engine. That is how bad I felt about my weight.
&gt;
&gt; I had a great week last week but during the weekend I had alot of
&gt; food. Monday I put the 2 lbs on that I had taken off and was very
&gt; upset. (Ladies, I am also suffering from those monthly cravings we
&gt; get.) I did good Monday but yesterday I just broke all the rules and
&gt; mentally beat myself up and hid from the group. I am over that now
&gt; and can go on again. I am still having the cravings but I think my
&gt; body has to get back to the sugar leaving my body and settling down.
&gt; Last week that took a couple of days and then I was fine.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks everyone for the help.
