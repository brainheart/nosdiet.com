Hi friends :)
I think that even though I haven't had a straight three weeks of red 
slashes, my body and all the rest, have adjusted quite 
considerably...
I say this because yesterday, from morning till bedtime, it was not 
just an S day, it was a G day...gluttony...
I had several hours where I ate my new &quot;regular&quot; amount of food, and 

by the time my dinner rolled around, I was feeling very satisfied 
with a big steaming bowl of soup in front of my crackling fire... 
then I had some chicken/cheese flautas... No not Thanksgiving fare, 
but I was enjoying them...
Okay.. I was good, then when my son and mom came home with 
Thanksgiving leftovers, I had an entire 2nd dinner... I am not 
feeling guilty about this, just disgusting.... I went to sleep 
packed with food, I woke up feeling worse than I have felt in a very 
very very long time, depressed, unrested, and like my brain was made 
of lead.... Who could believe that I spent not just days or months, 
but years, with these kinds of feelings, due to those kinds of 
eating patterns....
In retrospect, yes I was really looking forward to having some 
traditonal food, you know, all the trimmings... But I would have 
truly enjoyed it so much more, had I waited till either breakfast or 
lunch today.... So, some good news comes out of this, and some new 
feelings about my newly adopted habits.... 1. I must really be 
changing for the better, and whether or not my weight is dropping 
much now, I am really feeling steeped in a new way of eating... It's 
not just &quot;going through the motions&quot; physically, and emotionally, 

the new better ways of controlling my food, is far more enjoyable 
and now feels very much a part of me. 
2. Is that even on S days, I just don't enjoy being Gluttonous.... I 
won't put restrictions on myself for those days in terms of food 
types, but I was so unhappy, and still can feel the horrible 
feeling, from both eating double, no more like, triple portions, and 
going to sleep with an entire buffet in my tummy...LLLLehchhhh!
This is such an unsatisfying experience... So I would like to 
propose to everyone who feels similarly when stuff like this 
happens, to not only think of S days as &quot;pigouts gone wild&quot; and I'm 

sure Reinhard would tend to agree not, as he put it, &quot;to be a 
complete idiot...&quot; on these days....I will add to the S experience, 

by including that the choices we make, should bring a feeling of
*S* -atisfaction, not &quot;stuffed&quot; into a coma... 
Thank God I don't like this feeling. It is so strong, that it's 
further motivation to keep up my new lifestyle, and be proud that I 
can tell the difference :)
I don't mean to be a Thankgiving or S day &quot;pooper&quot; but I can only 

imagine that others may be going through this too, and I felt like 
sharing my perspective on this post &quot;stuffing and gravy&quot; day...
Still hoping that you all had fun with your loved ones, that's 
really what counts on all of these holidays :)
Love,
Deb
