Hi Everyone,

I haven't talked in a long time but have been reading daily. I 
started back again 2 weeks ago after giving up and trying South 
Beach. Now that I was successfull for 2 weeks I am hitting the spot 
that I think made me fall off and I need some input. 

As I did in the past when I started NOS I put on weight after a few 
weeks. I originally start at 164 lbs and this morning I am 167. I 
have never in miy live have been 167 and this happened when I did 
NOS the last time. 

What I think I have understood from other NOSers is that I need 
patience. I remember reading in the past a man who has been on it 
for the longest that it took awhile for his body to realize the new 
system it was on before he started seeing any weight loss. Over a 
month or 2. I think I panick when I go up to a number I have never 
been at before thinking I may go evern higher.

Has anyone found this happening before they started losing?

I am still sticking to it this time. What do I have to lose? Oh, 
the weight!!

Thanks everyone.
