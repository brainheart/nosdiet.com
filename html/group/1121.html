Welcome, Kevin. 

You've obviously got a way to go, but I think you're
in great shape mentally (don't laugh, this is
important). You're not just dabbling with a &quot;wait and
see what happens&quot; attitude -- you have that critical
sense of personal responsibility and were just lacking
some structure. There's a big difference between
having the right attitude, of course, and following
through, but it's surprising what a difference the
right way of looking at the problem can make. No one
has unlimited willpower. Either we've got good habits,
or we have to organize our efforts so that our limited
willpower can build good habits. It seems to me that
you really get this, and that's huge.

You mentioned what a shock it was to notice how much
you'd been snacking. This reminds me of the article I
linked to a while ago about the Amish that described
the typical American way of continuous snacking as
&quot;one big meal all day long.&quot; 

A word of advice to fuel your resolve to resist work
temptations: if you can't avoid exposure, try to get a
kick out of your sense of superiority at resisting
them. There *is* a kind of sensualism in resisting
sensualism. And then make a note of whatever
especially tempted you so you can eat it on the
weekend. Of course, the best crutch to lean on is the
simplicity of &quot;pre-disapproval.&quot; You know it's not
allowed, that there's no excuse, so don't even give
temptation a foothold of consideration. It's much
easier to beat at this stage.

Best of luck,

Reinhard

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm 30 years old, and have been overweight ever
&gt; since the age of 10 or
&gt; &gt; so. I was a geek back then (still am, in fact),
&gt; and dealt with the
&gt; &gt; social ostracism by turning to food for comfort. 
&gt; I got over my lack
&gt; &gt; of social skills, but the habit of turning to food
&gt; for comfort and
&gt; &gt; entertainment remained. To make a long story
&gt; short, I now weigh 340
&gt; &gt; pounds. I knew I was heavy, but I was pretty much
&gt; in denial, until I
&gt; &gt; performed a couple of songs on a local access show
&gt; about a year ago. 
&gt; &gt; Seeing myself on video was a wake-up call. I
&gt; mean, I know they say
&gt; &gt; that the camera adds 10 pounds - so just how many
&gt; cameras did they
&gt; &gt; have on me?!? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Over the years, I've tried Aktins, Weight
&gt; Watchers, etc, but found
&gt; &gt; that I couldn't stick to them for more than a
&gt; couple of months. And
&gt; &gt; each time, I've had the rebound effect, where I've
&gt; gained back more
&gt; &gt; than what I lost.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I found the No S Diet through a friend's blog - he
&gt; had linked to the
&gt; &gt; Shovelglove page, which in turn led me here. It
&gt; immediately struck me
&gt; &gt; as being right for me. Despite being fat for so
&gt; much of my life, I've
&gt; &gt; never tried to dodge responsibility for it - I've
&gt; always acknowledged
&gt; &gt; that it's because I eat too much of the wrong
&gt; things, and I'm pretty
&gt; &gt; sedentary. So the No S Diet's emphasis on
&gt; personal responsibility
&gt; &gt; appeals to me. I don't know how easy it will be
&gt; to reprogram 20 years
&gt; &gt; worth of bad habits, but this seems like the most
&gt; rational approach to
&gt; &gt; doing so that I've yet found.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So today was my first day on the No S Diet, and it
&gt; has been
&gt; &gt; successful. I never realized just how ingrained
&gt; my habit of snacking
&gt; &gt; was, until I had to repeatedly stop myself from
&gt; picking up a candy
&gt; &gt; bar, bag of chips, etc. But each time, I managed
&gt; to stop myself. I
&gt; &gt; suspect that as I become more aware of this habit,
&gt; it will become a
&gt; &gt; lot easier to resist.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I'm looking forward to continuing in one
&gt; of the best diet
&gt; &gt; plans I've seen. As a former programmer, I think
&gt; that Reinhard has
&gt; &gt; indeed found the right level of abstraction for
&gt; the problem.
&gt; &gt;
