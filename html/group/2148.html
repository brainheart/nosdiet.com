Hi, Michael - Welcome back, and good for you! Did you see the recent post 

about the article saying that final success (changing diet habits) takes 

10-12 genuine tries? (Reinhard added it to his webpage.) So, cross off one 

more of the attempts needed to get you to success! It's kinda like a cat 

having nine lives. =)

Personally, I think coffee is fine, as long as you don't sweeten it 
excessively. Some of those specialty drinks can be 400 calories or more! 

You might be shocked if you look up some of them here: 
<a href="http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutrition_beverages.asp">http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutrition_beverages.asp</a>

I look at some of these borderline items (coffee with sugar, a piece of 

sugar-free candy, tea with milk, etc.) as temporary &quot;crutches&quot; which I 
won't 
always need. I think that if the item has 20-50 calories, or at least under 

100, and it is performing the genuine purpose of getting me through till the 

next meal without being a real snack, I am still NoS'ing. Sometimes if you 

get really hungry before mealtime, a sweetened drink will calm the hunger 

pains just enough to get you through. Remember that a teaspoon of sugar has 

16 calories, and estimate what you're using, then try to account for it in 

your next meal--perhaps skip a piece of bread or something.

I think crutches are good things to use when you can't walk on your own 
yet!

Just my opinion,
Diane

One question - where do people think starbucks coffee sits? It's clearly
liquid calories, but it's also coffee and I'm not sure if it's anything
other than milk and coffee, both of which are acceptable.
