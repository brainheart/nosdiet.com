Hi Beth, I'm coming from the T-Tapp web site too, not only have I 
fallen from a healthy way of eating, sigh....I've dropped the tapping 
as well. 
So here we are, a new month and a new year, I'll give it a wirl for 
three weeks with you, if you would like a partner that is. I really 
can't do much worse than I'm doing now. 
Hey to everyone else, glad to be a part of the group.

&gt; Thought I would start out w/an Austin Powers quote, to give you 
guys 
&gt; a general idea of what I am like (and to warn you too I suppose 
LOL).
&gt; I actually heard of NoS on a t-tapp web site (exercise site that I 

&gt; love) and started reading about it and trying to read all the past 

&gt; posts for this group. However, after several weeks now of reading 

&gt; posts, I figure that I may never get caught up, so decided to start 

&gt; up here. Today is the first NoS day for me. It has not been bad at 

&gt; all, but that in itself kind of scares me... please tell me this 
&gt; truly will work for me if I follow the 3 main NoS principles... my 

&gt; head is trying to sabotage me already by telling me it could not be 

&gt; this simple and that instead of losing weight I am going to just 
gain 
&gt; even more weight. Of course, I am not doing any other eating 
program, 
&gt; so why NOT give it 3 weeks to see what happens? The worst thing 
that 
&gt; can happen is a gain more weight- but by not being on any sort of 

&gt; eating program now I run that risk regardless. 
&gt; Anyway, hello everyone! Glad to be aboard here!
