Welcome, Maria.

&gt;I hope this group can give me some
&gt; support and accountability and vice versa.

Important as the support part is, I think the sense of
accountability is even more so. Eventually, the
internal audience, conscience, should largely take
over, but there's nothing like a few hundred friendly
outsiders to get things started.

&gt; 
&gt; Today is my second day on the Nosdiet and I can't
&gt; believe how often 
&gt; I snack. 

Half of this system is just waking you up to stuff
like this. You don't need to calculate carbs and
calories to realize you're overeating. Simply by
keeping discreet meals, the way people have done it
for thousands of years, excess jumps out at you.

&gt;I didn't 
&gt; want them to go to waste. But, obviously it IS
&gt; going to waste, but 
&gt; on my hips instead of the trash. 

You are absolutely right. By eating that stuff you
turn yourself into a walking garbage can. Besides not
feeling guilty, next time you have to throw something
out, try to get a power rush out of it. Think, &quot;if I'm
strong enough to throw this in the trash, I've really
got this problem licked.&quot; It's an opportunity to show
off your strength. Look forward to it. It doesn't just
make you feel good, but it impresses your subconscious
appetites as well. They're less likely to try to mess
with someone who can pull that off.

Good luck with day 3,

Reinhard
