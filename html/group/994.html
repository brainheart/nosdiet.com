There have been a bunch of posts on these two subjects
recently and I think they're not entirely unrelated.
While there is no reason you *couldn't* do nos plus
some other system, I think &quot;going multiple&quot; can be a
recipe for disaster if your primary motivation is
failure to stick with plain old no-s. Here's why:

1) If you can't even stick with one simple system,
what makes you think you're going to be able to handle
2? Making things *more* complicated is the opposite of
what you should be doing. The same holds for those who
want to &quot;de-S&quot; weekend days for more rapid progress or
to make up for weekday lapses. It's crazy to jump to
&quot;hard&quot; when &quot;easy&quot; is too much for you. Master easy
first; I think you'll find, as I did, that easy is
enough. Yes, it takes time, but it gets easier with
time, which is exactly what you want.

2) Giving yourself a &quot;backup&quot; system can encourage
failure. You might think, &quot;well, this isn't so bad if
it just happens once in a while and the backup
actually does catch me.&quot; But the primary issue is
you'll be confused as to what is going on. The
greatest of all dietary dangers, not sugar, not carbs,
not fat, but self-deception has room to maneuver.
You'll also be inclined to use one system to take
revenge on yourself for lapses in the other.

I know there are a bunch of people on the list who are
happily doing multiple systems and that's great.
Please don't take this as a criticism or
discouragement. But I also know that there are a bunch
who just need to buckle down and focus on the basics.
