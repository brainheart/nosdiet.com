Welcome, Mayo.

&gt; Ok, so I should confess that I'm only joining
&gt; half-essed here. *snerk* 
&gt; I'm only taking on the &quot;no sweets&quot; part of the plan.
&gt; I'm a grazer, and 
&gt; I like it that way. 

Whatever works. I'd be surprised if a lot of people
couldn't lose significant weight with just a targeted
single S, especially if they're not too far off their
goals. They were all three real issues for me, and
they we're all three not too onerous for me to
restrict/defer. But you're you, of course. Keep us
posted. We have very limited data on half essers as of
yet. Oh, and thanks for the term. Much funnier than
some-S. Hope you don't mind if I quote you on the home
page?

&gt; In terms of my own diet, I try to eat whole grain
&gt; stuff like 
&gt; stoneground whole wheat bread and oatmeal. 

I'm a big fan of oatmeal and black bread myself. I eat
less wholesome stuff, but they're my defaults.

&gt;I'm doing a fun shovel-glove inspired
&gt; hit-the-spike exercise with 
&gt; squat and tricep extension at either end--without
&gt; the shovel-glove 
&gt; because I'm too weak right now to carry the weight

Happy to have provided some inspiration! Don't worry
about being too weak to swing around a sledgehammer
just yet. Just carve out the time, and make it a
habit. The muscles will come. Just standing around for
14 minutes every N day is a start.

&gt; Does anyone have an idea, preferrably with
&gt; link and pic? I was 
&gt; thinking something along the lines of Britney Spears
&gt; at her fittest--
&gt; she's pretty short, yes? I'm at 120 right now, but
&gt; it's mostly flab at 
&gt; the moment.

You'd think stuff like this wouldn't be too hard to
find on the internet :-)

Best,

Reinhard
