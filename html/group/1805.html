&gt; I am a 42 year old Army soldier and I have really let myself go. 
I'm about 5'8 and the last time I attempted to get on a scale, I 
weighed in at 217 lbs. I am so depressed. 

Hi TornadoFreak! (do you live in Kansas?)
So sorry to hear you are so depressed, you are amongst friends 
here...Well, get ready to be &quot;undepressed&quot; NoS is so doable and 

enjoyable that you won't feel completely passive but you won't be 
getting totally crazy about food either...The thinking and planning 
is so minimal that it's a great no-hassle &quot;program&quot;...But beware, it 

is a slow speed &quot;diet&quot; that is mainly a maintenence style of eating, 

so if you compare it to the other Billions of fad diets, and not 
even fad, but quickie fix ones, which neglect the concept of 
breaking old unhealthy habits and creating and maintaining new ones 
for life, you might not see results as fast as *we all* wish we 
could see...It is a totally wonderful plan and we would love to have 
your company...So get your NoS sargent self at attention :)
&quot;Ten Hut!&quot;

What's the problem? I guess I've just 
&gt; given up and just decided to be FAT. 
...I can't belive that you have decided to be fat..We all make bad 
decisions sometimes, I'm sure you are oversimplifying things..From 
the small description of your job right now and your age, I would 
venture to guess that the sedentary 8 hours at a desk plus the 
waning metabolism from plain old getting older is the culprit...Well 
the good news is that if that truly is the case, and you 
actually &quot;decided to be FAT&quot; you can start &quot;ungiving up&quot; right 
now 
and &quot;undecide&quot; to be fat instead :)

I hope I can get some 
&gt; inspiration from the chat group. 
...I hope you can inspire us too, Tornado :)
PS do you have a name? 

Wish me luck.
Good Tornadofreakin' luck!
Peace,
Debbie

PPS Check out the www.urbanranger.com
and also www.shovelglove.com 
and their respective Yahoo groups for great exercise ideas.
PPPS The founder of the NoS group, Reinhard Engels, started out at 
around the same weight you are, and in 2 years took off 40 lbs
Check out his &quot;Before and After&quot; pictures on the NOS website...That 

will probably inspire you too.
It inspired me! LOL (sorry Reinhard, don't blush too much)
