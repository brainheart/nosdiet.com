Hi, Amy,

First of all, disclaimer: I am not an expert; this is stuff I've
learned from research, and I may get some bits wrong, though I'm sure
that I'm generally right--feel free to correct me, anyone.

Almost all women don't have enough testosterone to truly bulk up, so
you really shouldn't worry that you'll become mannishly muscle-bound.
Female bodybuilders work incredibly hard to get muscular, and they're
not lifting (relatively) dinky 12 lb shovel gloves. Shovel glove may
cause you to bulk up, but I'll tell you why that doesn't matter. At
first you may think you're bulking up, and you may be building muscle,
yes, but likely a lot of it is water and glycogen (?) at first, which
builds up quickly because your body isn't used to the exercise. When I
first started lifting, my body retained a whole bunch of fluid, which
was gone in a few weeks, so definitely don't let the initial weight
gain panic you into not exercising.

Look at yourself in the mirror naked. Do you see flab and pudge, or
visible, striated muscle? You should think of your body as visible fat
(the fat hiding your muscle tone) over muscle over...even more fat. A
lot of people don't think of the fat they have underneath their
muscles and even in between their muscles, but they should because
it's not muscle pushing their bellies out it's fat, or they'd be able
to see definition in their muscles and likely visible veins. Unless
you see defined muscle with the cuts between each muscle group, you
don't have to worry about having too much muscle. (Plus if you have a
hard time doing stuff like carrying groceries, then you don't have too
much muscle.) And if you're not doing any sort of weighted exercise,
then trust me, you don't have too much muscle.

That said, if you want to concentrate more on your weight and losing
fat, you should probably concentrate more on cardio, and only do
shovelglove (or whatever weighted exercise you choose) once a week so
you're not dieting away the muscle you do have. Apparently, once a
week is the magic maintenance number; if you let it go beyond a week,
you don't progress. If you want to gain more muscle, do work out the
same muscle group no more oftener than once every 48 hours--the muscle
needs time to recouperate and grow. Also, it seems it's easier to
either lose fat or build muscle, one at a time, which is why a lot of
weight lifters have a long bulking period with intense training then a
losing fat period with more concentrated cardio and maintenance
lifting. So don't worry if you go back and forth. Just make sure you
at least do some sort of weighted exercise once a week. Cardio, you
can do every day if you'd like. It's more a matter of ratio for
targetted goals than of doing or not doing. So if you see that you're
&quot;bulking up,&quot; don't panic and stop shovel gloving, just cut back 
to
once-a-week maintenance, and concentrate on cardio for a while.

Basically, don't worry about getting &quot;big&quot; through building muscle.
Try to lose the fat instead, because it's the muscle that's holding up
your skeleton, and it's muscle that burns calories just by being
there, and it's having muscle that raises your metabolism. (Male
professional body builders have to eat like 4,000 calories a day just
to maintain the big muscles they have, cuz muscle eats up protein like
crazy.) Fat mostly is there to store energy long term--very good in
case of famine, not so good in an industrialized society. You have to
exercise to stay thin into old age unless you want to eat less and
less as you get older while your muscle and bone waste away and your
metabolism slows down down down.

if you'd
like more info. I cribbed a whole bunch of info from her.

Best,

mayo :-)
