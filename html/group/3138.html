Thanks so much Deb. Last night was so rough. It is as if I can't 
watch tv unless I am eating. Even though I am not &quot;hungry&quot;. I do 

like the coffee idea. I drink mine black, so I believe that is a 
suitable solution to pop. I also bought some green tea. Any 
suggestions on curbing the late night snacking that I have become so 
great at??

&gt; &gt; Hi all. I feel so fortunate to have stumbled upon this group. 

My 
&gt; name is Karen, I am married with a 15 month old son named 
Benjamin. 
&gt; I have been using him as my excuse for not getting back in shape 
&gt; after the pregnancy. I quit my job when he was born, and this is 
the 
&gt; first time I have ever stayed at home for so long. 
&gt; 
&gt; ...Hey Karen! Welcome :)
&gt; Congrats on your new moherhood status.... the hardest non-paid job 

&gt; around!
&gt; I know what you're talking about... I didn't work full time untill 

&gt; my son was over 4 years old, and those first two years were killer 

&gt; hard... You're giving so much to Benjamin, now congratulate 
yourself 
&gt; for also making YOU a priority... I think most new moms have 
&gt; that &quot;clean the plate&quot; bad habit... Well here's two other options, 

&gt; tupperware, and le garbage...
&gt; I believe wasting food is a big time shame, so if your son doens't 

&gt; have a huge appetite, why not give him one less scoop of mac and 
&gt; cheese? As far as soda is concerned, if you can cut that out for 
&gt; even 50 percent of your usual intake, you will be helping yourself 

&gt; in huge ways! The great thing about NoS is that you really get a 
&gt; new chance every day, and it's designed to help you in the long 
&gt; run...
&gt; I lost weight at about 3 different times since my son was born, 
with 
&gt; different short term fixes... but once I went &quot;off&quot; it all just 

came 
&gt; right back on over one year of terrible overeating... I am proud 
to 
&gt; say that I've been with NoS since last August and got through the 

&gt; rough Winter doldrums without packing on an additional 10-20 lbs...
&gt; My son Richard, who will be celebrating his ninth birthday next 
&gt; Tuesday, is doing a 75% version of NoS with me... We have cut 
&gt; snacking and sweets down to only 2 or 3 days a week for him, as 
&gt; opposed to every day last year, and he has dropped 2 inches from 
his 
&gt; previously, starting to get &quot;husky&quot; tummy...I am so proud of 

him... 
&gt; Just yesterday, my mom had offered him half of a baked potato.. 
Well 
&gt; our dinner wasn't totally ready yet and he simply said &quot;Not right 

&gt; now grandma.. On NoS we have to wait until it's mealtime to eat..&quot; 

I 
&gt; thought I would burst with happiness! There's nothing wrong with 
&gt; half a baked potato, but thank goodness he isn't falling into 
&gt; the &quot;eat whenever food is presented to you&quot; mode, and is 

practicing 
&gt; restraint... If we all ate all day, we would all get fat... Okay, 

if 
&gt; you are doing so much activity and are in the under 25 age range, 

&gt; this might not yet apply to you, but eventually, eating all day, 
&gt; results in gaining... As for me, I'd like to lose about 7 or 8 
more 
&gt; inches from my waist, and somewhere between 30-40 lbs...I am 
&gt; starting to break my plateau again and I lost about 1.5 lbs this 
&gt; week, but because I am doing regular weight lifting with 
&gt; Shovelglove, my body isn't dropping weight as much as &quot;fat and 

&gt; inches&quot;... I am down about 3 inches from my waist and 2 inches 

from 
&gt; my arms... Yay!
&gt; So it's no little thing that NoS is a livable and &quot;Sanity 
Friendly&quot; 
&gt; plan, because, as Reinhard states in his homepage, unless you can 

&gt; see yourself on any diet for the rest of your life, you might as 
&gt; well not even start it... Most diet research backs this up... 
Don't 
&gt; worry if you don't get it perfect immediately... Long term success 

&gt; is like that &quot;tortoise and hare&quot; story... If you gear up for NoS 

to 
&gt; behave like other quicker methods, you will be disappointed, as it 

&gt; is really more a maintainence style of eating... I say, if you can 

&gt; focus on your worst habits first... the soda, and the &quot;I am a 

plate 
&gt; cleaning vacuum mom mouth&quot; then you will be off to a great start...
&gt; It took about 5 or 6 months to change my portion sizes, but I am 
&gt; thrilled to say, that it just happened naturally... painlessly...
&gt; You will be setting a great example for your whole family and 
&gt; especially your son who will follow in your footsteps.
&gt; Reinhard is the greatest group leader, and we are all the luckiest 

&gt; people for finding NOS! Write anytime you need a lift or feel 
like 
&gt; tooting your horn. We are all here to help :)
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb
