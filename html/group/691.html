Curd cheese is similar to cream cheese but with a lower fat content and it, like 
cottage cheese, has had a lactic starter added. This gives it a light acidity and a 
light flavour, colour and texture. It is sometimes called medium-fat soft cheese. I 
like it best of all for cheesecakes because it gives them a lighter flavour and 
texture.

so its like ricotta?

a

is
&gt; used to make cheesecakes as an alternative to cream cheese, but only 
has
&gt; moderate amounts of fat. Cream cheese is very fat. Good hunting. please 
let
&gt; me know your local name for it. If you have Czechs in your area, they 
would
&gt; know it as &quot;Tvaroh&quot;. It definitely is a simple cheese and not 
fermented like
&gt; yoghurt.

&gt; &gt; Someone described eating raw veggies dipped in Ranch dressing as 
an
&gt; evening
&gt; &gt; meal. Here is a recipe for a tasty dip with not too much fat in 
it.
&gt; &gt; 1 tub curd cheese (Quark is a possible alternative cottage cheese is 
too
&gt; &gt; grainy)
&gt; &gt; 1 small tub natural unsweetened yoghurt.
&gt; &gt; A few salad onions or scallions.
&gt; &gt; 2 teaspoons powdered sweet paprika
&gt; &gt; A little salt.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Put the curd cheese into a bowl and stir in yoghurt until consistency 
is
&gt; &gt; right for dipping. Chop the salad onions (green and white parts).into
&gt; rounds
&gt; &gt; about 1/10inch thick. Stir into the dip.Season with a little salt. Add 
the
&gt; &gt; paprika, a little at a time and mix thoroughly until the dip turns 
a
&gt; salmon
&gt; &gt; pink.Chill before serving.
&gt; &gt; This dip is very tasty on celery sticks and carrots.
&gt; &gt; Enjoy Hanadr47
