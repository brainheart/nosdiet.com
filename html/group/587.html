Greetings from a new member who has been secretly reading all your 
emails. (Were your fingers tingling?) What fun! I started no-s 
February 21, yes, I know that was a &quot;S&quot;aturday, but I figured I 

might as well start the diet on one of its less stringent days. I 
must say that the reason I chose no-s was that I know I'm not going 
to carry a calculator/measuring cups/&quot;approved&quot; food lists with me 

to dinner. I was becoming so obsessed with which foods were ok that 
I was hungry all of the time. (your body reflects what your mind 
dwells on...) I also realized that the foods I gravitate toward for 
snacks are anything but carrots, celery sticks, blablabla. They (my 
snack foods and the sweets) are exactly the foods that made me what 
I am today. So if I do nothing but eliminate snacks and sweets 
(seconds are not much of an issue), and keep up my mild exercises, I 
can't help but lose. Just as I looked in the mirror one day and 
screamed &quot;EEK,&quot; I know one day I'll look in the mirror and 
scream &quot;YAHOO.&quot; The best to everyone...
