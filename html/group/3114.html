i sort of like this chart thing, Nathan
i d like to know what everyone is up to.. but what i don't like is the general sense 
of &quot;competition&quot; it involves.. lets see, i do nosdiet for myself and i 
compete only with myself and my habits and i have the rest of the group for support ( 
and they are very good at it by the way).. i d rather think of them this way than my 
competition... nosdiet is supposed to be a self challenge, not a group competition 
(or i am that way inclined to believe)...
and besides Nathan, life is full of stressful competitions so why should i give 
myself one more???
and about keeping everyone updated about the progress everyone makes: it s great 
really (partially cause like mayo, i am nosy he he he) but then it s not that 
necessary cause whenever anyone loses a few lbs or a few inches or whatever , s/he 
makes a big fuss out of it (me included) and u ll eventually get to know and measure 
ur progress to everyone else's
see my point??
love Dee

Hi Nathan, I think I would like the idea of a friendly challenge. 
I like Reinhard's chart idea. I have been around for awhile and 
have still been struggling but I don't stop trying.
