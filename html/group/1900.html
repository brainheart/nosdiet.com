&gt; HI Deb, So now that Halloween is out of the weigh !! haha we can 
really enjoy looking forward to Thanksgiving Dinner with out the 
guilt.I am going to take it i believe as one of my s days that week. 
we will see when it gets here. It is also DH birthday, so extra 
dessert is always on the table. I really appreciate your support and 
inspiration that you are. I dont think it matters how much you have 
to lose becase we pretty much all got here the same way. Eating more 
than we should, having babies, mid life spread the list goes on. But 
we are all here together,loving,supporting, teaching and exhorting 
each other to hang in there,to eat to live not live to eat(i heard 
that somewhere maybe WEIGH DOWN)anyway i liked it :) As far as sizes 
I am in a 12 but my ideal is a 6.have a very petite frame. Everyone 
has there own ideal weight,you will know when you get there, trust 
your self.The good news is i ate at noon and i still feel very full, 
not sure why, didnt eat that much, maybe my body is adjusting. I 
have already voted this am. yah.DH will do it after work, he asked 
me for my voter guide, he is pitiful :), but he trust me and wants 
to vote intellectually. I do love him dearly- all 21 years next 
month.I was truly blessed to find this man. TTYL Jools

&gt; Deb, 3 inches, that is so inspiring !! I wore a shirt this weekend 

i 
&gt; couldnt get on over a week ago, much better now. I have approx.15-
20 
&gt; to lose. 
&gt; 
&gt; ...Thanks Jools :) I feel pretty great right now. Congrats on 
your 
&gt; shirt! I am in a totally different league in terms of pounds I 
need 
&gt; to lose. I wear a size 2O pants...But as I mentioned before, they 

&gt; are starting to slide off, and if I went shopping today, I'd 
&gt; probably be able to fit into 18's, I'm not sure...
&gt; My ideal weight range is anything between 130-150...I have over 50 

&gt; lbs to lose, so I like the idea of focusing on my inches, because, 

&gt; frankly, the abstract concept of having to lose 50lbs is too 
&gt; overwhelming and depressing...
&gt; I am going to inch my way to success instead :)
&gt; Hope you and your daughter are enjoying NoS!
&gt; Peace and Love,
&gt; Debbie
