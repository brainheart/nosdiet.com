Jeanette -

I wish there weren't so many of us! I end up having a lot of friends who 

are like me, only worse, and I hope you can say the same because it is 

somewhat comforting to know that &quot;at least you're not *that* bad.&quot; =) One 

of my old friends, for example, was extremely perfectionistic, but you would 

think she was a &quot;messy,&quot; because if you dropped in when she wasn't 
expecting 
you, there would be laundry, unwashed dishes, and clutter everywhere. If 

she did know you were coming, it would probably be stuffed away in a 
bedroom. But she was, in fact, a perfectionist, and I know she was 
constantly on the go...just not efficient or effective. When she did start 

cleaning, she could get sidetracked and start scrubbing nooks and crannies 

in bathroom fixtures with a toothbrush, while the &quot;big picture&quot; of the rest 

of the bathroom waited for her...and then she was probably caught short 

again. I am not being critical because this is my tendency too!! My 
parents may have reined this in a bit and forced me to be more realistic, 

but otherwise, I'd be right there. Perfectionism plus distractibility is a 

dangerous combination, eh? I am *very* distractible.

On the other hand, if I weren't a perfectionist, I wouldn't be good at my 

job, and I wouldn't be able to do some of the nice creative projects that my 

friends and family appreciate and admire. *Somebody* needs to see to the 

details, so don't be too hard on yourself!

I tried Flylady, too (Debbie, see www.flylady.com ...it's very unique and 

amusing!), but it got overwhelming and I'm not in charge of a household so I 

couldn't apply much of it. It's interesting to hear that it made you worse 

instead of better! I think that the fact you can see *where* your problem 

is, is a big start. Too many perfectionists I know don't have a clue what 

their problem is. And others, whose lives are incredibly complicated so 

they are always stressed, don't even see a need to de-complicate (oh, sorry, 

I guess we do have a word for that: &quot;simplify!&quot;). I said something to one 

of those friends about my/our need to simplify, and she said, &quot;No, I don't 

want my life simpler! I'm not willing to give anything up!&quot; Well, then. 

=) Sorry, but I *do* want a simpler life.

I don't know why being on this list keeps pulling &quot;sayings&quot; out of me, but 

here's another one: &quot;Done is better than perfect.&quot; With our personalities, 

that is really hard to swallow, but it was given to me by one of the most 

efficient, amazing young ladies I know! She is quite happy and gets 
everything done. I'm trying it--you can too! =)

Diane
