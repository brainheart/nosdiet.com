&gt; hi evryone
&gt; i ve been reading all your post for 3 weeks or so
&gt; and i finally decided i am going to join in the
&gt; conversation... and the nos diet ,too
&gt; mmm... i ve already made my shovel glove a couple of
&gt; weeks ago and i used it TWICE..!

Double welcome!

&gt; he he he, the first
&gt; time was a disaster because i used my back to do all
&gt; the movements and winded up having a very funny
&gt; feeling down my back. for a whole week , or so .
&gt; second time was better (but it was 10 days ago)..! i
&gt; couldnt believe how unfit i ve become (&amp; maybe
&gt; always been , but didnt quite notice it before).. 

I've just added some more &quot;start slow&quot; warnings to the
shovelglove home page. I think my light approach makes
people forget it's serious exercise...

&gt; i still find &quot;time&quot; a major issue to deal with, i
&gt; never have any ... not even those SG 14 mins..! and
&gt; the &quot;timing&quot; too is my next major issue, tried to do
&gt; it in the morning but i never wake up early enough
&gt; (those 14 mins are really very crucial 

...

&gt; so i need u &quot;experienced essers&quot; to tell me how u
&gt; managed the &quot;time&quot; and the &quot;timing&quot; issues when 
u
&gt; first started..

The shovelglove group would probably be a better place
to ask that, but I can tell you what I did/do. I make
it non-optional to do shovelglove every N-day. When
during the day is up to my daily self, I'm not going
to micromanage. I try to do it in the morning, before
work, both because I find it invigorating and because
the longer you put it off the less likely it is to
happen, but sometimes (like this morning) various
crises intrude and I can't squeeze it in before work.
On such days, no sleep till I do. Exhaustion is no
excuse, I had my chance to do it unexhausted, and it's
nothing compared to how lousy I'll feel if I skip out.

&gt; Reinhard, i think i am deeply in love with u ..!
&gt; so when u start looking for a life-long partner take
&gt; me into consideration..

I'm very flattered! But also very taken. 

Reinhard
