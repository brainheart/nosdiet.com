Hi Julie,

Thank you so much for asking -- I love this. Strangely enough, it's 
starting to really feel normal. Maybe that's because it IS normal 
for people to have mealtimes, and not graze all day and night like 
cattle!!!!!Not to say grazing isn't thoroughly enjoyable... anyhow, 
I feel great. Don't want to weigh yet, but my clothes are definitely 
looser. I simply have no sense of deprivation, and this doesn't 
require being a food weirdo in any way. The only thing I've had that 
feels like a cheat to me is having a protein or calcium supplement 
between meals that I know has about 10-20 calories. I mean, we are 
talking a tablet or two, no more. 

I hope you are having a good week.

&gt; &gt; Hi Sheila, just wondering how the week is going for you,been 

&gt; following your post and am rooting for you for June. Keep reading 

&gt; and posting you wild woman ! Dont forget to plan for a sweet this 

&gt; weekend.Thats the beauty of this EP is that you get rewarded not 
&gt; only by losing weight, having people cheer you on, feeling better, 

&gt; but every weekend you get to sss a little if you want.I find if i 

&gt; dont then its harder to start fresh on MOnday. I dont over do it 
by 
&gt; any means, my personal addiction is Starbuck FF caramel 
macchiato.I 
&gt; lay in wait for saturday for my treat. I pass SB everyday, so its 

a 
&gt; visual reminder i will get one on saturday but not today !:) I al 

&gt; slowly cutting my addiction to coffee, and have conquered the 
pepsi 
&gt; addiction, so am on a roll. So anyway, welcome &amp; have fun taking 

&gt; control of your eating and losing the bulge(as deberoo put it so 
&gt; aptly)TTYL Julie
&gt; &gt; It's marvelous finding like-minded people who sound so sane.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I got thru my first weekend, having to remind myself to let up 

&gt; just 
&gt; &gt; a bit, like I had an orange between lunch and dinner, and a 
plate 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; salad before my main course! Wild woman!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; People are telling me I look better. Have a great week, 
&gt; everyone.You 
&gt; &gt; are all looking good to me.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sheila

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time to go un-incognito... 
&gt; &gt; &gt; .....Hey nice that you are now cognito Sheila, welcome and 

&gt; &gt; congrats 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on your first week :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I knew immediately that this is the answer!!!!For life!!!! 

It's 
&gt; &gt; like 
&gt; &gt; &gt; finding your soulmate... you can't find the right one until 

&gt; you're 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ready, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ......That's excellent! Your enthusiasm is well warranted and 

I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; feel the same.. It's an instantaneous &quot;click&quot; in the brain 

with 
&gt; &gt; NoS 
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasoning.. very clear, no BS.... the &quot;Diet of our dreams!&quot; 

&gt; Tall 
&gt; &gt; &gt; dark and something we want to be with and no resentment for 

&gt; &gt; secrets 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and baggage.. it's an honest, intelligent and respectful 

&gt; partner :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I also have a June goal -- I don't wanna turn 50 and be fat! 

I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; think I can handle a 20 lb. weight loss during the next four 

&gt; &gt; months, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't you think?
&gt; &gt; &gt; .....You can do it Sheila!!!! You are armed for the battle of 

&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;bulge&quot; LOL :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck to you...
&gt; &gt; &gt; Deb
