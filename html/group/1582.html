Dear Group, And here is a newsletter I get, and it is all full of anti
sugarisims. If you care to read.=0D
Thanks for the Cinnimon tip....I always add it to my yougart, and sometimes
to my decaf coffee in the evening...only cause I love the smell, and was
told it was good for dieters...now I see why.=0D
Bonnie=0D

Cancer study reveals: Avoid &quot;carb-cinogens&quot;=0D
=0D
Despite what the cereal commercials, soft-drink billboards, and the=0D
USDA Food Pyramid say, some of us have known for decades=0D
(like the late Dr. Atkins and myself) that a diet high in=0D
carbohydrates =97 especially refined grains and sugars =97 is a recipe=0D
for obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and a whole host of other=0D
health problems=85=0D
=0D
But what about the Big C? So far, not a lot of research has been=0D
done to specifically pinpoint what a high-carbohydrate diet's=0D
effects are on developing the most feared of all diseases: Cancer.=0D
=0D
Of course, it doesn't take a genius to see that along with our=0D
waistlines, rates of every major type of cancer have ballooned over=0D
the last 30 years, but the pointy-heads would argue that this is a=0D
mere association, and not indicative of a causal link. In other=0D
words, what looks like a duck and quacks like a duck isn't=0D
necessarily a duck, according to the tunnel-visioned mainstream=0D
medical statisticians.=0D
=0D
Finally, though, there's some hard evidence to support what I've=0D
known for years: That a diet high in carbohydrates causes some=0D
types of cancer, and not just by virtue of the fact that such a diet=0D
makes people obese. As reported recently by the Associated Press,=0D
a Mexican study of nearly 200 women showed that those who=0D
consumed a high-carb diet (more than 60% of calories from=0D
carbohydrates) were MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY to=0D
develop breast cancer as women who adopted a lower-carb=0D
approach to eating.=0D
=0D
This study supports a similar body of research from last year that=0D
linked a greater risk of breast cancer among women to a diet high=0D
in sugar (especially soft drinks and desserts), the most damaging of=0D
all carbohydrates. Another study from earlier this year suggested=0D
that a high-carb diet may raise the risk of colon cancer.=0D
=0D
According to the article, scientists who believe in the carb/cancer=0D
link hypothesize that the extra insulin released to process the=0D
simple carbs and sugars we ingest far too much of causes cells to=0D
divide and also leads to higher levels of estrogen in the blood. Both=0D
of these factors (cellular division and blood estrogen) can=0D
contribute to cancer.=0D
=0D
So what are we doing about it? Are we moving in the right=0D
direction, carb-wise? Not really, if today's obesity trend is any=0D
indication. And since &quot;carb addiction&quot; often starts when we're=0D
young, here's some not-so-encouraging news about what we're=0D
feeding our kids =97 and what health problems we're setting them=0D
up for in the future...=0D

GOOD NEWS:=0D
THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT IS FINALLY CATCHING ON=0D

The bad news: You could die waiting for the mainstream doctors=0D
and the National Institutes of Health in Washington, DC, to complete=0D
their testing process and confirm what practitioners of natural=0D
healing have known for years: Natural healing techniques work.=0D

The school-lunch blues=0D
=0D
Despite the fact that I've written in the past about a few kernels of=0D
relatively encouraging news when it comes to what our kids are=0D
eating and drinking while at school =97 namely, the fact that both=0D
the Philadelphia and New York school systems have banned soda=0D
and candy machines from public school premises (DailyDose,=0D
3/2/04) =97 the overall trend in food that's available to our children=0D
while at school continues to be dismally unhealthy.=0D
=0D
Even though the low-carb approach to eating has caught on in=0D
restaurants, grocery stores, and even at fast food drive-throughs,=0D
the menus at our school cafeterias (where many kids learn their=0D
eating habits, mind you) are apparently still sticking to the=0D
antiquated Food Pyramid's 11 servings a day of bread and grain=0D
that's made 30% of our population clinically obese.=0D
=0D
And while the nation struggles with a current epidemic of=0D
childhood obesity! (Gee, I wonder why?)=0D
=0D
Yes, the pizza and mac-and-cheese continue to be doled out in too-=0D
large portions to school children all across the U.S, despite an=0D
increasing number of parental requests for lower-carb options for=0D
their kids, according to a recent Associated Press story. Even the=0D
President of the American Society of Bariatric Physicians has=0D
come out in support of changing the school-food menu to=0D
something with a more moderate carbohydrate content.=0D
=0D
But does this really matter to the Fools on the Hill. Nope. The=0D
fatter we get from the foods they're recommending, the more=0D
money they rake in from taxes on the grain and sugar producers =97=0D
and the drug-makers whose poisons doctors will prescribe to=0D
combat the effect that all those carbohydrates will have on us.=0D
=0D

them a lunch every day of something healthy =97 like tuna fish, egg=0D
salad, or a leftover pork chop and some fresh fruit...=0D
=0D
And don't give them any &quot;lunch money&quot; that could end up in a=0D
candy machine (or a bully's pocket).=0D
