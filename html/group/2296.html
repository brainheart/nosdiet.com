&gt; Dear No S,
&gt; To Deb, I am sure your Mom meant no harm, after all she did write 

a note about an S day....but I always feel &quot;you sabotager&quot;
&gt; when anything out of the planned pops in my path...

....Hi Bonnie belle, I actually threw in that &quot;saboteur&quot; comment 

just for *you* LOL. As I wrote it I had a feeling you would write 
back, what with your Frenchiness speech in the past! LOL
You are totally right. She didn't mean to sabatoge us, it was a 
very sweet gesture... It was the mouse who sabatoged us!!!!
And, by the way, isn't the proper plural form &quot;meeses&quot; LOL :)
So yesterday reminded me of how my mom used to buy this totally 
decadent spreadable stuff called &quot;Nutella&quot;...Have any of you ever 

had this? It is basically, spreadable chocolate and hazelnut paste, 
with I think, some powdered milk in it.. but basically, *ALL SUGAR* 
LOL. Before we lived here, and before NoS, she always would stock 
this &quot;treat&quot; for Richard. The only problem was that it never really 

took the status of &quot;treat&quot; because he would eat it at all times... 

As soon as the front door opened he would stand there in the pantry 
and just eat it out of the jar with his fingers! LOL :)
Messy boy covered in chocolate goo.... When I first joined this 
group and devoted my heart to NoS, I asked her to please clear out 
this decadent temptation from the cupboard, as it was clear to all 
of us that Richard would eat it 24/7 if he could...Who could blame 
him this stuff is sooooo soooo yummy!
Anyway, she argued with me on this... She didn't like me telling her 
what she could or couldn't do as a &quot;treat&quot; for Richard... She 

begrudgingly finally, gave in to eliminate it from the pantry once 
we moved back in with her... Yesterday was so out of character for 
my mom... Diane, yes it was a victory for sure, and actually, when I 
think about it, she has recently asked me how things with my &quot;diet&quot; 

are going? Some interest I guess... You wrote that it would warm 
anyones heart to get a message like she wrote, whether it followed 
good or bad times... I have to say, that it is *such* a rarity to 
agree on *anything* with her that it was especially important to me 
because, usually, emotional support is sadly lacking... I know this 
sounds like an exaggeration, but I can tell you with total honesty, 
that my mom has a very hard time saying positive things to me... She 
was constantly put down and invalidated as a child by my very tough-
willed and hypercontrolling Grandfather, and like the saying goes, 
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. So the thing that I was 
going to say is that, in my whole life my mom has said &quot;I'm proud of 

you&quot; perhaps 2 times.... It's like saying supportive things and 
positive things was not part of her identification as a child and it 
takes something *away* from her, if she says something nice to me...
It totally sucks, but I can't really expect much...
So Diane, this is why it's much more major for me than if this 
happened on a regular basis... it's almost a miracle :)
Maybe it is.
I am going to move my ass outside and go for a hike in the woods 
again today... It's pretty sunny outside (but oooh cold! 45 
degrees?) but it's been on an off raining the last few days and I 
better grab this chance while I can :)
Have a great NoS day everyone!
Love and Peace,
Debbie

...just now the Thanksgiving holiday threw me off, and my
&gt; thinking is &quot;if I cant be perfect, why try....well now I shall try 

to think, if I can't be perfect, at least try to make some 
progress.......sounds better! Bonnie

....Bonnie, I think not only Thanksgiving, but just the fact that 
for people in Northern Hemispheres, that seasonal change can really 
make you go into &quot;hibernation&quot; and let's store some fat for the 

Winter mode... it isn't just one holiday :) Good luck friend!
