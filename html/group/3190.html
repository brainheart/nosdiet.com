Hi, gang,

Been busy, and will be busy again soon, so I thought I'd check in
during my lull.

First of all, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RICHIE! Because it's been scientifically
proven that writing in all-caps conveys twice as much birthday
cheer--and thus cancels out the lateness of the greeting.

It sounds like you guys are doing really well, getting your
turtle-groove on. I, too, have been grooving like a reptile, albeit
one with a sporty headband and kicky knee-socks. It's the aerobics
phase (losing fat, and maintaining instead of building muscle) of my
slow and steady path to fitness, which means that today I went for a 3
mile walk and was pooped at the end of it. I remember when just a year
ago I was jogging 3 and walking another 3, and I realize that this
cycle of getting out of and into shape must end! Or I will be forever
mourning my past athleticism. I don't think it's a good idea to dwell
on failure, and that's not what I'm doing. Heh. I just remember the
slow and steady descent into getting unhealthy, and I just keep it in
mind when I'm tempted to fall back into inactivity. It's not really
that hard to do 50 jumping jacks in front of the tv if I'm too lazy to
go outside or lift heavy items, so that's what I do if I haven't done
a bit of exercise that day.

It's tax-return week, so be strong and don't stress out and give into
temptation! :-) I've been eating less, no-s style as a part of losing
fat, and I've found that it helps if I eat less than I think I want,
then grab a piece of fruit to deal with the demands my stomach makes
for even more food. For some reason, I find it harder to stop eating
than to not eat, so the fruit keeps me from wanting more, plus it's a
good signal for me to stop eating. Maybe I can even make it Pavlovian.
The joys of human psychological experimentation. It's like knowing
I'll be having dessert later, so I eat less to make room for it.

Congrats on the weight loss, Deb and Julie! Stay strong, Dee!
Remember, you're young, so you can afford to take things slow, so
don't stress it. Best of success on all your no-s days, everyone!

mayo
