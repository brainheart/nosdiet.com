&gt; one day of nosdiet to see it...
Hi Dee, Isnt it amazing ! When you are grazing all day, you never 
notice how much you are eating( just adding fuel to the fire or so 
they say). They have no idea what &quot;they&quot; are talking about !! 

more like fat on the &quot; &quot;
&gt; so how was my first day???
&gt; i had 4 meals (no medical condition) and that s the least i could 

come up with.. 
Thats great ! My first week i over ate at every meal so afraid i 
would get hungry between &quot;meals&quot; all i made myself was over full of 

course. I quickly learned just as others have and you will too.:)

&quot;never noticed before that i actually keep walking while eating ( 

that cant be healthy.. can it? )

The problem with walking and eating at the same time is you dont 
notice as quickly when you are full because you arent concentrating 
on your meal and noting when you are full.Meal time should be for 
eating. Not eating in combination/doing chores,watching tv(of which 
im guilty)homework etc... 
&gt; mum made me a cheeze cake today..
Well here we go again only this time its not pecan pie !

The great thing about cheesecake is it gets better every day, so 
save it til saturday gf. You will be so glad you did and so proud of 
yourself. We all must remind our selves until it becomes habit 
anyway that it is an everyday choice to break these SSSN habits.
i could consider thursday as &quot;sursday&quot; and every &quot;single&quot; day as 
an 
S-day.......! Oh you are funny arent you LOLOL call it what you 
want but we all know it is what it is !!

And thats how it should be! :)

Jools
