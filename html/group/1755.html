Try buying yourself a luxury fruit, whatever you really like that costs 
as
much as a box of chocolates and save it for supper(I'd have a pomelo if 
I
could find one) then you could be looking forward to something instead 
of
worrying about falling on the path

Subject: [nosdiet] day one - well sort of


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; hi guys
&gt; I made myself a promise that I would post no matter what. I've found 
in
the
&gt; past that I will write in a diary for example, when things are going 
well.
&gt; well, everything was ok till late this afternoon at work. and I had 
a
small
&gt; packet of crisps.
&gt; but all day I was thinking about how I'd go off the rails when I got 
home.
&gt; I had thought to myself that I would email now, around dinner time, 
each
&gt; night cos it is my difficult time and thinking of you and your successes
&gt; would help keep me on track. I still think it will, but today isn't 
the
day.
&gt; I am about to go for a walk, and I hope I will come home to just one 
meal,
&gt; but I doubt it.
&gt; I will not berate myself, but I get worried and puzzled that I have
trouble
&gt; building a 3 wk habit (ie it is only day one).
&gt; things were muddled so breakfast (yoghurt &amp; sunflower seeds and a 
little
&gt; flaxseed oil) wasn't till about 10.30. I had thought I was meeting 
a
friend
&gt; for lunch but that's tomorrow, so I hadn't bought any lunch with me.
&gt; Then work was busy and I bought a sandwich and kransky sausage at 
about
&gt; 3.45.
&gt; So I know that this all doesn't help - cos it isn't the ideal.
&gt; Group I need you, and I have promised myself I will post each day til 
I
get
&gt; the 3 weeks up. I hope you can bear it.
&gt; bye for now
&gt; jen
&gt;
