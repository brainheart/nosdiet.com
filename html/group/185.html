It is Bonnie Again,
How does a couple of cups of coffee before breakfast fit in, that is without
sugar, but I must use at least a half cup of milk total?

Dear No S Followers, 
This person said it all. 
I, also , was making myself and my poor husband crazy, different diet every
time I turned around. I also don't have too much to lose, 25 to 30 pounds,
in my case, and kept saying&quot;just like when I quit smoking, got to 
keep
trying until I find a way to succeed. &quot; Now I have found the way to quit 

Dieting&quot; and still lose weight. Bonnie

I'm glad to hear that this is working for you. I am just starting my third
day, but I gotta tell you that this plan is going to be a winner for me.I 
am
not extremely overweight. about 15 lbs., but my way of eating over the 
last
4 years or more has been trying. I would read all these diet plans like..
don't eat carbs,don't eat fat, never eat a speck of sugar. I would latch 
on
to them for a few weeks, but realize I couldn't or wouldn't stay on them 
for
life. I then began to really eat out of control in between plans. I have
done more damage to mself by all these plans . I didn't know what to eat
anymore. I can see how people get trapped into real eating disorders. I
think I was close. I like the idea that I'm eating food like everyone else.
I have freedom to not have to think about it constantly. I also imagine 
I
will save alot of money buying normal food, not energy bars and no fat 
this
or that. Thank you for sharing about your new found freedom and encouraging
this newbie ! Louann
