Congratulations on the 10 lb. loss!! How long did it take you to lose it? The No 
&quot;S&quot; starts today for me. It will be a little bit harder because my parents 
surprised the whole family (they live in Florida, we live in Michigan) and came up to 
the family party on Saturday. Just strolled right in!! ;-) Anyhow, they are here for 
a week so there will be lots of family get togethers this week. I will just need to 
be more conscious of what I eat when, etc.

&gt; Hello. I'm just wondering if those of you who follow the NoSdiet, 

do you also exercise? If so, what exercise do you do? I am always 
jumping on and off the exercise bandwagon, but have jumped back on as 
of lately. I hope the combination of the two will shed some pounds 
and make my body shrink! I am going on vacation three weeks from 
today, but I know I will get in enough physical activity with 
walking, etc. but I am hoping I do as well as I can on the noSdiet 
while I'm there. Between now and the time I go, I hope I can lose 
about 6 pounds or so (though I do know that fat loss is more 
important than what the scale reads).

I walk.. have not made it to the point of considering myself 
an &quot;urban ranger&quot; yet, but i walk. Wish i could find an equivalent 

to the shovel glove for my weakling girly armed self.

So far on no s i have lost ten pounds.. nothing came off in the last 
two week period but i fell off the wagon a few times. I had a 
chocolate craving a week long and fed it.
