I loathe wearing tights, as we call pantyhose here, but I have found some
that are bearable. I have long, slim legs.What I find comfortable is
stockings, with shorts shaped underpants, with little legs, with suspenders
( I don't know what you call them)attached for hooking on the stockings.
This is where a similar language becomes a problem. What I think you call
suspenders for holding up men's trousers, we call braces. I generally get
round the smart clothing problem by wearing floaty trousers or long skirts
and either sandals on bare feet or knee high stockings. I love the under-
pants with little legs as they leave a nice smooth line and I have one 
pair
that really pull in my tummy.

&gt;
&gt; HI Everyone, Well it went better than i thought it would, first to
&gt; Ross for my daughters outfit for the wedding. As i have said before
&gt; she has lost some weight the last several months and is doing NOs
&gt; with me for the most part. It was so great seeing her try size 9/10
&gt; on ,of which she hasnt worn since she was 10. She was so happy. and
&gt; it only spurred her on further. I suggested we purge her closet of
&gt; any big clothes and start replacing them as needed. As for my
&gt; shopping at first it was highly disappointing then i felt we should
&gt; go to Steinmart and look around, My daughter helped me find the
&gt; nicest silk outfit which fit pretty good, not perfect, but at least
&gt; i have something to wear(now must find shoes and some good tummy
&gt; sucking hose :) Thats tonight. I can do shoe shopping in my sleep.
&gt; Hose might be a bit of a downer.I awoke this am feeling more chipper
&gt; than i thought i would. Thanks for all your thoughts and prayers. 
It
&gt; helped knowing friends were out there rooting for me. Love you all
&gt; Julie
