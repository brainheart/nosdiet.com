&gt; So I fell off the wagon last night. 
....This happens Carrie. Just get on again :)

&gt;Even tho I stumbled big time last night, I think I'm starting to 
get used to not snacking like I used to in the evenings.
....That's great! Not all the habits are equally stacked against 
you...Some may be much harder to break, so just try to whittle away 
at them and notice the &quot;big picture&quot; as you go along... You might 

not be able to do all NoS's at once in the beginning... Not snacking 
that much at night is a BIGGIE! I don't know how old you are 
Carrie, I think you are much younger than me... but let me warn you 
that night time snacking is probably the one which will make you 
gain serious pounds, once you aren't in your youthful twenties, so 
if you can get that one under your belt you will be so much 
healthier and less likely to blimp up when you are older! :)

&gt;Its no fun to feel so stuffed and yucky.
....No it's not, so try to remember that yuchy feeling the next time 
you consider a free for all binge... It's not worth it :)

&gt; Anyway, I changed the calendar to December last night and was nice 

to realize its a new month, I can start fresh checking off the days 
that I stick to NoS.
.....Each week that you do this it will boost your self confidence 
and before you realize it's happening, you will truly have new good 
habits, all working in your favor :)
Love,
Debbie
