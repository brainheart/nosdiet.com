&gt; the fact there as no winner or loser, made it cool to watch.

...In many more primitive cultures that have been on this planet for 
much longer than modern Western civilization cultures, for example, 
the Australian Aborigines....It doesn't make sense to play a game 
unless all the participants can have fun, and everyone wins...
It is enlightened thinking behind this, but unfortunately it's not 
the common view of what constitutes a sport or game.
It's very hard to argue with the ego, and winning some competition 
appeals to our &quot;ego self&quot;...

My chest muscle is no better today,makes me feel so 
weak.I dont think its my heart, feels weird. TTYL JOOLS
....Julie, incase you haven't realized yet from my profile, I am a 
massage therapist, so I can't resist responding to your condition.
If you strained any of the pecs (pec major or minor) or your 
intercostal muscles (ie: ribs) you may have some lingering trigger 
points within the muscles...this could also be coming from your 
diaphragm muscle as well, and there is even a remote possibility 
that you may have a tiny tear in your pericardium (the outer 
supportive connective tissue which anchors the heart to both the 
spine and the diaphragm) This sounds muscular to me, and trigger 
points can cause a big metabolic drain on your muscles, causing 
fatigue and weakness. They overload the nervous system with pain 
signals, so sometimes the location may be a few inches away from the 
pain and the pain you feel is &quot;referral&quot; pain.
I recommend looking up a good licensed therapist, with strong 
training and knowledge of the treatment of trigger points.
This is also called Neuromuscular massage as well, so consult your 
local massage practitioner. If it is a trigger point, it can be 
remedied easily, and probably one session should do the trick...
Sorry all for the off topic post..
Julie, write me at my email if you have any other questions on this.
Love,
Deb
