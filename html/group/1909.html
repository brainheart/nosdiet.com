&gt; today i did not have such a great food day...i was ok until around 

lunch, we 
&gt; got really busy with some people in really bad shape and i had to 

delay my 
&gt; lunch by 2 hours...i was so hungry by one ish that i grabbed some 

candy... i was 
&gt; truly afraid that if i did not eat something that i would make an 

error that 
&gt; i could not afford to make. after that, it was pick, nibble and 
nosh the rest 
&gt; of my shift. i think that i could have handled today better, but 
after having 
&gt; a slip i got a really bad attitude. i am sick and tired of eating 

bad and 
&gt; being fat.
&gt; i will stop eating for tonight, and tomorrow will be a no s day ( 

or else ! ) 
&gt; HI Donna, Well honey today is a new day. with new choices to make. 

I understand what you mean about getting so busy there is no time to 
eat. Also remember working at the hosp. night shift with 24 babes in 
the nursery and no help, no time to eat. I feel your pain and 
frustration. Yesterday is over, yah.Willbe thinking of you today, 
pray it goes better. Just a thought, a quick o.j.will bring the 
blood sugar up, better choice than candy if its available.Good Luck. 
Heres to a succesful no s day. Julie
