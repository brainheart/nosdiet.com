&gt; Amber- The big thing I think is to make sure that when it comes 
time for your meals, that you are not UNDEREATING. I have a problem 
with this, from past diets, where I was so scared of eating beyond 
my satisfaction level, that I would not quite get to the point of 
eating to satisfaction... which meant a few hours later I was hungry 
yet again! 

.....Hi newbies :)
yes, at the beginning, even if it's for a month or two, just eat a 
good sized meal... No one is suggesting that you have a football 
sized hamburger, but chances are, if your plate is a normal, 
pleasant looking, decent sized one, and you cover it with healthy 
choices of food, that should really stave you off until the next 
scheduled meal...Again, NoS isn't trying to create an overeating 
habit by encouraging these sufficient and filling meals, just trying 
to eliminate the unconscious nibbling habit, which can add many more 
calories to your day than most people are even aware of...
PS. Not to sound in any way sarcastic, so don't read anything like 
that into it please :)
It is really okay to be a bit hungry between meals... That is normal.
What is not, normal, is having food in our stomachs 24 hours a day...
Unless you are raging hungry, a little grumble of the tummy is not a 
bad thing, infact it makes the next meal even more enjoyable :)
Peace and Luck to you!
Deb
