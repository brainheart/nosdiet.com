Hey, Deb!

It actually sounds like you're doing great! It took me forever to
connect my lethargy (and doldrums) with the foods I was eating (not to
mention the lack of exercise)--it just didn't occur to me to do so--so
really, pat yourself on the back for being so self aware. Next time
you'll know what bingeing does to you, and most likely, you won't do
it. I still give in to temptation every so often even though I know
better, but regard these instances as minor lapses that won't matter
in the long run. Seriously, simple carbs apparently knock me out
completely. I think I'm just unusually sensitive, so scrutinizing my
diet has been really helpful in helping me feel more alert and in
control.

Go, Deb, go!

&gt; Guys I had a pretty big late night binge on home made red cabbage 

&gt; coleslaw! This morning I measured myself as I was feeling very 
&gt; lethargic and puffy.. Well I'm up a half inch on my arms and almost 

&gt; an inch on my waist...
&gt; More proof that water weight can really screw you up...
&gt; I will certainly not be stepping on any scale... I know this is a 

&gt; temporary thing and a direct result of a minor screwup, but I also 

&gt; find it boggling that my body is so sensitive to change... A healthy 

&gt; eating week usually shows up pretty quick with me, and esp. if I am 

&gt; active...but it's just as easy to blow the gain with a step back 
&gt; into the old ways... Wow...
&gt; I'm trying not to get bummed out by this..
&gt; Must breathe...
&gt; Any cheerleaders around to say 
&gt; &quot;Go Deb Go!!!&quot;
&gt; Peace and Love,
&gt; Deb
