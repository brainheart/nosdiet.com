Hi Lee,

&gt; Reinhard, I have another questions. If I want a
&gt; peanut butter and
&gt; jelly sandwich on N days for a meal is this ok?

This is one of those borderline issues that I wouldn't
worry about unless you're being totally strict
otherwise and don't feel you're making progress. I
think I even specifically mention peanut butter
sandwiches as being ok somewhere on the home page. I
remember Brian, who's lost a lot of weight, mentioned
that he eats them frequently. 

What do I do personally? I'm not a huge pb&amp;j eater to
begin with, so it's not much of an issue, but I have
been known to indulge on an N day, and just count it
as a regular meal. No, it's not the ideal thing to do,
because it is sweet and can be a slippery slope to
worse, but who cares about the ideal if you're at good
enough. 

I found a post from a while back which puts it a
little better:

&gt; 
&gt; As I mention on the site, peanut butter is one of
&gt; those borderline foods that might be a problem for
&gt; some, but is probably just fine for most people (it
&gt; sounds like it's a positive help to you, Kevin, eat
&gt; on
&gt; with a clear conscience). Unless you're spooning it
&gt; out of the jar, I'd say it's probably more risky to
&gt; stress about avoiding it than it is to indulge in
&gt; moderation. For purists, there is also the &quot;healthy&quot;
&gt; sugarless peanut butter, which I have to admit is
&gt; not
&gt; my favorite, at least not when purchased
&gt; prepackaged.
&gt; But the supermarket near me has a machine that
&gt; grinds
&gt; the peanuts into butter in front of your eyes (just
&gt; one ingredient!), a process which so impresses me
&gt; that I've managed to convince myself that I do in
&gt; fact
&gt; like the stuff. Honestly, though, I don't think it
&gt; would fare so well in a *blind* taste test.

Best,

Reinhard
