Dear Gadway,
This is all so true! I am very much over 50 and therefore know of what
you speak. My mom always had an afternoon snack for us, but that was it
other than the 3 meals. We never had to count calories, fat, or carbs......I
think there were like two fat kids in the whole town, and every one said
they had a gland problem.
When my Mom started to gain a little in Menopause, but I think it was
because she loved coffee, and home baked cookies, and we kids did not have
much of a sweet tooth, my Dad worked away from home a lot, being a
commercial fisherman, a very thin man as you burn every calorie with that
hard work. Once she started walking, like her mother did, the pounds came
off.
But like you say....no S is Simply like life in the 50's!
Bonnie

Hello, All! I've been a happy NoS'er since January 1, and have lost 5
pounds.

Yesterday and today I noticed a happy thing: I am eating the way I (and
virtually
everybody else I knew) ate in the 1950s.
