Debbie, that's about the funniest &quot;diet story&quot; I've ever heard, and you 

definitely did the right thing. If the scale could make you that angry, it 

didn't deserve to live. Hanging the corpse on the wall was an inspiration 

as well! (There's a little barbarism left in all of us.)

&gt;It won't have the final word on my state of mind anymore! Not one more peep 

&gt;out of that torture machine :)

Absolutely! I'm sure I've mentioned already that I &quot;threw off the tyranny 

of the scale&quot; years ago. I went scale-free and happy for several years, 

losing weight slowly and keeping it off. I thought I had the problem licked 

for good. Now I think the only thing I did wrong was not to substitute 

another more reliable measure. When I started regaining, I honestly didn't 

realize it. I can't go into detail now about that time, but I think it 

would have been better if I'd done my weight loss with No S or something 

similar, because then you know when you go beyond the useful measures we do 

use: plates, timeframes, and whatever habit of exercise we have committed 

to.

&gt;Wow! You should all try this...I am totally stoked! So, if you people think 

&gt;I am crazy, you are probably right, no secret there, LOL!...

There are two scales still in my house, and they don't belong to me so I 

can't smash them, but I give them a wide berth and use them only skeptically 

and sparingly. I know that neither one is accurate, and they don't agree 

with each other, so all I can get is a very general idea of my possible 

weight. If the average of three weighings on each scale goes down once in a 

while, I'll know that I'm losing. =D To be more specific, a few weeks ago 

I weighed more or less 206-7-8-9, and when I reported a 2 pound loss the 

other day, it was because I saw a consistent 204. But this morning I felt 

thinner, so I got curious and stepped on. I always recite my own &quot;mantra&quot; 

before doing that: &quot;The number you see will not affect your attitude, or you 

are not allowed to get on! Okay, I promise!&quot; The first number I saw was 

184. Hmm, time for a new battery! So I got on again and it was about 
205--I think! The fact that I can't remember right now is probably proof 

that I am hardened to the torture device. I have overcome at last! =D

But the important thing is the NoS stickers I have put on every weekday this 

month.

Diane
