Joanna,

I can't tell you how happy I am to read this. It's not
just that you're succeeding (though that's decisive,
of course), but that a good measure of your success is
due to the fact that you're simply *paying attention*
to your eating habits, and that the diet encourages
you to do this. 

The power of self deception is enormous; people just
don't realize how much they are eating and suspect
profound and sinister causes for their weight problem
-- your well known mexican eatery story is a case in
point. The carb/calorie accounting diets get this, but
don't get that we aren't robots and have other uses
for our time. When there are only three doors for the
&quot;enemy&quot; to get in, you can watch them carefully,
without it becoming a full time job.

I drink whole milk too. I find that drinking skimp
milk doesn't fool your appetite -- it'll just demand
three times as much in revenge for being short
changed.

Thanks for all the details (I particularly love the
vintage plates bit) and congratulations!

Reinhard

&gt; I can't actually say how much weight I've lost--I
&gt; never weighed 
&gt; myself to begin with--but I am down in jeans size
&gt; from a very tight 
&gt; 18W to a well-fitting 16W. I feel...completely
&gt; normal. I eat three 
&gt; meals a day...like normal. There are no shakes, no
&gt; bars, no lots of 
&gt; tiny meals...it's a miracle for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Something I've found out: The &quot;Fence around the
&gt; diet&quot; is VERY 
&gt; important for me. To quote Don Henley, &quot;the wolf is
&gt; always at the 
&gt; door&quot;. I found that if I relaxed on the one plate
&gt; rule even a 
&gt; little, that my old eating habits would start
&gt; creeping in. I found 
&gt; myself a couple of times, when serving my plate,
&gt; sneaking bites from 
&gt; the serving container. Trying to fool myself. So now
&gt; I always make 
&gt; sure to prepare my ENTIRE meal, and have it on the
&gt; plate before I 
&gt; eat. Sometimes if I don't trust myself, I will help
&gt; myself to a dill 
&gt; pickle and munch on that while I'm cooking. But
&gt; mostly, I pretend 
&gt; that I'm french, and make a production out of my
&gt; meals.
&gt; 
&gt; I got a nasty cold about three weeks ago...so I used
&gt; that 
&gt; opportunity to stop putting half n half in my
&gt; coffee. I drink it 
&gt; black now, something I never imagined I could do. I
&gt; drink a lot of 
&gt; coffee, so this is a significant change for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Stomach capacity is WAY down. A couple of weeks ago,
&gt; my husband took 
&gt; me out to dinner at a well-known mexican chain
&gt; restaurant. Usually 
&gt; we run through 2-3 baskets of chips, plus the queso
&gt; dip, plus our 
&gt; dinners. Wow. This time, we finished half of one
&gt; basket of chips, 
&gt; 1/4 of the cheese dip, and then I managed to eat
&gt; about 1/8 of my 
&gt; fajita dinner. In the old days, (pre NOS), I would
&gt; have eaten all of 
&gt; my dinner, now matter how many chips I had consumed.
&gt; My husband is 
&gt; not on the diet, and I realized that all those times
&gt; we ate all 
&gt; those chips...it was ME eating the majority. Never
&gt; again. This 
&gt; night, I was &quot;pigging out&quot; for the special occasion
&gt; of dinner out, 
&gt; and that's the best I could do. I was floored. And
&gt; two nights ago, 
&gt; we stayed up late watching a movie, so I went and
&gt; made a bag of 
&gt; microwave popcorn (yes, a snack, I do that
&gt; occasionally), and I 
&gt; barely ate 1/4 of the bag. I used to make each of us
&gt; our own bag.
&gt; 
&gt; Three meals is my goal every day, but yesterday, due
&gt; to a weird 
&gt; schedule, I only got two meals. And occasionally, I
&gt; eat 4. But when 
&gt; I eat, I use vintage dinner plates that I've
&gt; collected for years, 
&gt; and they are only 9 inches across, instead of the 10
&gt; or 11 inches 
&gt; that modern dishes are. It's funny, because I used
&gt; to never use 
&gt; these dishes, I just collected them because they
&gt; were so pretty, but 
&gt; I didn't serve food on them because they were small.
&gt; And the bowls 
&gt; are small. Well, I just had breakfast before I sat
&gt; down to type, and 
&gt; I used, without even thinking, the smaller vintage
&gt; bowl for my Wheat 
&gt; Chex and 1/2 banana. With whole milk. That's one of
&gt; the things I 
&gt; love about the diet...I can eat whatever I want. I
&gt; never drink skim 
&gt; milk anymore, I use delicious whole milk on my
&gt; cereal, and I'm 
&gt; losing weight anyway!
&gt; 
&gt; So that's about it. I am just really happy. Everyone
&gt; knows now that 
&gt; I'm on a diet, because they are noticing my weight
&gt; loss. Instead of 
&gt; just saying &quot;I'm doing portion control&quot;, I tell them
&gt; about the NOS 
&gt; and tell them to look it up on the internet. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm doing great, and I look better. I'm starting to
&gt; see a jawline 
&gt; again. Yah!
&gt;
