 Hi All!! I just joined and thought I should introduce myself. 
I'm a 15-year-old overweight girl. I'm sick of being overweight, 
I'm sick of always feeling like someone is making remarks of my 
weight, and I'm just plain sick of feeling fat! I weigh around 150 
lbs. and I want to lose anywhere between 20-30 pounds! I started 
this diet yesterday, the day after my Birthday. It's surprising how 
much that I've realised how much I eat! 
Everyone get's a &quot;wake up call&quot; to do something, but, I prefer 

to call it inspiration. I just graduated from the 8th grade and for 
our last class trip, we went to a camp for 3 days. Well, on the 
first day when I was in the cooking group, one of my close friends 
informed me that the other girls kept saying how I needed to go on a 
diet. I felt like I got slapped in the face when I heard this! 
Later that night, the same girls invited some of the boys over to 
our cabin. They thought I was asleep, but I heard everthing they 
said (which I confronted them about the next day, a HUGE step for 
me). They said horrible things about me, and I was always nice to 
every single one of them!! Anyways, a couple of weeks ago, my best 
friend called and told me something that brought my self-esteem way 
up. My best friend is a boy, I'd say a cute boy. I always thought 
he was embarassed by the way I looked. But, he said that no matter 
what happens in the next 4 years, he'll always be there for me!! I 
felt like crying I was so happy! I guess that's part of my 
inspiration, although the first part wasn't really inspiration.
Well, now you know some of my story, and I expect I've ranted on 
for far too long!

Best Wishes To Everyone,
~*~*Kimi*~*~

P.S. I've never faced my weight problem before, this has been a 
huge summer so far for me!
