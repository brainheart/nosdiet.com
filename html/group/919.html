D's posting with this subject line had little to do with religion. 
this one does. if you are thoroughly convinced of the lack of a god 
or the inefficacy of prayer, then you can blissfully ignore the rest 
of this post. i think the majority of you may benefit from it. 
some people can drop a few pounds successfully by &quot;putting their 
mind to it.&quot; i have relatively few pounds to lose, but my weight is 

an issue that has plagued me for years. i've also got youth on my 
side. i came to the conclusion awhile back that i am incapable of 
losing this weight by my own strength. for those with a lot more 
weight to lose and who have ingrained bad habits a lot longer than i 
have, i can imagine that you would find it even more difficult. if 
you look at any 12 step program- AA, overeaters anonymous, etc., the 
first step, i think, is to acknowledge your dependence on a higher 
power. i expect that even with complete faith and openness to God, 
the process will still be trying and long. although i am not 
yet a weight-loss &quot;success story,&quot; i have seen prayer work in 

amazing ways in other parts of my life. i am actually greatful for 
this particular struggle, because it forced me to turn to God and i 
am more committed to my faith. maybe it was part of His plan. 
maybe not. give prayer a try. i don't think Zeus will strike you 
down with a thunderbolt for asking.
