&gt; I have not been able to NoS this past week! I don't know why! I 
feel 
&gt; like I'm testing myself, or self-sabotaging, because I was so 
happy 
&gt; during the first honeymoon period.... I just have to get this out 

&gt; there -- maybe it will help. What's wrong with me??? I haven't 
been 
&gt; able to stop defying this plan by snacking and eating sweets. I 
want 
&gt; to stop being so crazy, I really do. Has anyone else gone through 

a 
&gt; bad spate like this, and what got you out of it? 

i would like to just remind you of Deb's word's &quot;i love myself&quot; i 

was touched by that, and that is how you should feel. What you are 
experiencing i have as well not only in dieting but other things for 
me it's been fear of failure i can laugh at myself afterwards and 
say i wasn't really trying.
This time i have declared to you all that i am not trying i am 
doing, so i just get on with it, in NoS you are allowed to fall, get 
up back on the wagon since we are all out here for you, imagine here 
i am all the way in Africa and i care that you achieve your goal.


I haven't gained 
&gt; weight, according to my measurements, because I am exercising. 

We all didn't put the weight on in one day, neither can we get it 
off in one day, but one day at a time. Of course if i had the money 
and all i could get it off one day in an extreme makeover via the 
surgeon. Haa haa haa

&gt; Thanks for listening -- I feel slightly better already.
that's what we are here for.
