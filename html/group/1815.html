Dear Hana, 
I also just got a new puppy, only he is a year old Golden. Now I have 3
Retreivers! He is very loving. Normally I have always gotten new pups, 
but
he was a casualty of divorce. So now my oldest is a cancer survivor of 
11,
and then my now &quot;middle pup&quot;is 3. They have Italian names...except for 
Roxy,
we have Guido and Nino. I had no idea you had a stroke last year. So did 
one
of my dearest friends, just before he turned 60. He is doing great now, 
but
a little frustrated as he was working and very active before, he lives
outside of Paris, so the healthcare is excellant in France. But he knows 
at
this point he can almost do everything he did before, just slower. By the
way, no S is kicking in for me finally. It was not the diet that was flawed,
but I am the one who served ice cream in my shop all summer. We stopped
serving the sugar free as no one was buying it, so then I started eating 
the
regular....bad move!
Lately, slow but sure, as I am 61, I have been dropping a pound of Fat 
a
week. My jeans are feeling looser...8 lbs so far...is that a stone? Less
than 4 kilos.
Bonnie
