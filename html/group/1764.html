&gt; thanks julie :)
&gt; what you say is true
&gt; the yoghurt bfast is my regular bfast - so I hope that's ok.

&gt; lunch no, but I was fine with it.
&gt; then eeek.
&gt; but today is another day.
&gt; I'm up at 5 am doing some work (I am creating an online guide to 
copyright
&gt; for teachers) so I am feeling happy about that and it is going 
well.
&gt; I will keep on - I have visions at the moment of my own personal 
ground hog
&gt; no-s day :)
&gt; if I get lucky perhaps it will become a week.

&gt; HI Jen, that is great, though no luck is involved in this 
diet.Just a day by day change in lifestyle from what i can tell. I 
am having my pm coffee to get me thru the afternoon. Could go for a 
cappucino right now though.I think if we face our weaknesses(choco 
and cafe for me) it helps, no secrets, keep a safe environment 
around us(work and home), enjoy life and enjoy our sometimes minute 
by minute sucesses over our sssss.I have to remind myself that food 
was created to be enjoyed or why would God create the cocoa bean, 
and that good food is for our nourishment as well as enjoyment. Its 
just we all have enjoyed it to the excess LOL:) I DO LOVE TO EAT. 
But i really like fitting in my clothes better. Stay strong Julie
