&gt; I'm so used to a black and white, all or nothing approach, that I 

&gt; have difficulty with what I perceive as &quot;half-measures&quot; (which we 

all know &quot;avail us nothing&quot; -- thanks a lot AA/Big Book). 
...Oops another post, I just couldn't resist here, sorry for 
cluttering the inboxes I promise this is my last one until many more 
hours pass...I guess I'm just feeling the Spririt today :)LOL

Valerie. If we were to take a poll of this group, and I am 
suggesting that you all chime in here, hint hint, I would venture a 
guess that your black and white view of &quot;things&quot; in general, is a 

common trait amongst many others of us.. I am that way, and I'm 
slowly trying to see the &quot;grey&quot; in life... It's a very unproductive 

way of thinking, as you mentioned, and can be downright 
detrimental...The reason is, I feel, that this thinking comes from a 
place of Judgement...and in terms of diet, when you &quot;fall off the 

horse&quot; instead of saying &quot;oops I hurt my heinie a little, now I will 

just get back on and try some more&quot; the thought processes usually 

lead to a very vicious cycle of &quot;I failed, this stinks, I stink, why 

bother, eat more because I stink, gain more weight, feel 
stinkier&quot;...you get the idea..
As Reinhard says in the Mainpage for NoS &quot;Zero percent of 100 is 
still zero&quot; something is infinitely better than not trying at all.

Val:
&gt;Although I guess in some situations, 'half-measures' are better 
than 'no measures' at all. Valerie

....Here's a little happy memory, in my ramble style, I'd like to 
share on this.
Back when I was in music school, at Queens College, I had the great 
good fortune of auditioning and getting accepted into the &quot;Y 
Chorale&quot; from the NY 92nd st.Y 
The director was probably one of the most interesting and vibrant 
conductors I have ever met, and a very special lady, named Amy 
Kaiser.
She was a spitfire to say the least... When we were singing Mahlers 
enormous opus &quot;Das Klagende Lied&quot; with the NY Philharmonic (a proud 

time for me to be sure) I was one of 175 singers... At rehearsals 
she used to answer everyones questions by name, and over fifty 
percent of these singers, like myself, were totally new to the 
group...She was a real people person, and a wonderful inspiration in 
my life.
Anyway, she used to say, in rehearsals, &quot;If you are not going to 
give it 100% then why bother&quot; That statement has stuck with me since 

back then in 1988...
It is unlikely that anything we do in our lives will be 100% perfect 
at any given time. I feel what we need to do is take the emphasis 
off the &quot;perfect *outcome*&quot; so much and just put 100% of our hearts 

into it... It is very satifying to say, &quot;I know that at this moment 

in time, I have tried my hardest&quot; and if my hardest isn't perfect, 

who cares...you know that old saying &quot;if at first you don't 
succeed...&quot;
Yes, any measures you make to help you be healthy are better than 
none. I suggest you don't even think of them as &quot;half&quot; measures and 

rather as &quot;this is my best for right now&quot;...it's alot more likely 

you will feel happy about your efforts by looking at them this way.
Okay that's enough.
PS... I was just thinking of you yesterday Valerie, and wondering if 
you'd be back again.. I guess you got my &quot;message&quot;! :)
Keep on truckin'
Love,
Deb
