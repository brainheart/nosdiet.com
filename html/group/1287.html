You go Jen! Food should be a nourishing experience for all of your 
senses, infact in the acupuncture system, the stomach meridian begins 
under the eye, travels down to the jaw then back up to the temple and 
back down the face in a U shape path, then through the throat 
eventually going through the whole front of the body...So
1.you look at your food
2.you chew your food
3. you think about your food
and then
4. you swallow your food

Lets face it..Our fast food society usually doesn't encourage steps 1-
3 and skips straight to 4...
On mad tv there was a parody where this kid quotes his mother as 
saying &quot;My mom told me, fast food leads to a fast death&quot; I thought 

that was priceless...Because it really is true...I think it's the way 
we eat, and not necessarily what we eat, that is the issue for most 
overeaters. We are up against alot of brainwashing,,also on the 
dieting end of things, a diet should be a healthy plan for eating 
well, even that word is perverted these days and then we have more 
unlearning to do in our thinking on this...that being said, you 
should truly pat yourself on the back every single time you avoid 
a &quot;eat and run, brain off now&quot; moment...Alan Alda was on tv about a 

month or so ago and he was talking about how at first he thought he 
would resent the structure that, I think, weight watchers and that 
point system, or calorie counting would be boring and that when he 
actually started to have to be responsible for conscious eating, he 
found he enjoyed and relished every bite..that is how food should be.
Plus, personally I believe that the more we really make an effort to 
savor our meals, like they are the best thing you could be eating in 
the whole planet, the more we will look forward to future meals, and 
then snacks won't be such a temptation...We know we have something to 
look forward to, and we are building self discipline in the process
What a winning combo!
PS what is your favorite fragrant flower?
My personal fave is Night Blooming Jasmine, but Roses aren't too 
shabby either : )
I believe that Mr. E is going to appeal to smart people who are 
hoping to better themselves, not some diet guru...so hats off to 
all of us for being those lucky bastards : )
Peace and Love,
Debbie
