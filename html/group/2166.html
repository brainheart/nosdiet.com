&gt; HI Deb, well I caved in on Sunday and stopped at Starbucks for my 

Macchiato.Other than that i had a regular N day. I was telling my 
friend deb in indiana about our little group and she will probably 
be lurking around. Shes a school nurse and hysterically funny. Met 
her when I was 18 and her 23. roomed together, in weddings 
together,babies being born. you name it weve seen it and done it 
together. Well nearly :)We are remodeling our 18 yo daughters room 
into a guest room for her when she is home and our numerous guest we 
have thru the year.I doubt she will come home to live again as she 
is just like me once i flew the coop i was gone except for 
intermittent visits. Glad Richard is better. I love it when kids 
write thank you notes, i cant say my kids always did but i tried.I 
also believe in homeopathic medicine as much as possible.I hate pain 
pills (RX) and will even try to sleep a headache off if i can. My 
MIL is also and has a cure for everything. I helped her once this 
summer she got into poison ivy and i told her to use cold buttermilk 
on her rash and it worked !!! she was thrilled. I guess thats why i 
like this diet plan, nothing unnatural about it, no 
shakes,powsders,bars etcc which all taste nasty. just good ole food.
well must get rady for an appointment with clients so talk at you 
later, love julio

&gt; &gt;I took it easy eating saturday.and didnt even have my caramel

&gt; sss. 
&gt; ....Good for you Jool! And hey, thanks for sharing that I am not 
the 
&gt; only person who has sat on their remote, oblivious to it! LOL. 
&gt; Well, in my defense, if you look at the neurological &quot;map&quot; of the 

&gt; human body, called the &quot;homunculus&quot; or &quot;little man&quot; it shows 
that 
&gt; most of our sensory nerves are in high concentrations in the 
fingers 
&gt; (roughly 50,000 per square inch!) and in our *mouths*! And the 
least 
&gt; innervated parts of us (just motor/sensory, not the internal 
&gt; organs), is the legs and butt! We simply don't feel as much 
there :)
&gt; So we are at a disadvantage, because, in a way like Navin 
described, 
&gt; the relative mass of our heinies could skyrocket and we might not 

&gt; feel it until way too late! LOL
&gt; And then we might *never* find that remote!
&gt; Hey remember that gross scene in Austin Powers, when they plant 
the 
&gt; tracking device on &quot;Fat Bastard&quot;? so gross! LOL
&gt; 
&gt; How is Richard dong after 
&gt; &gt; his last murphy incident ??neck okay? We are hard at work on our 

&gt; &gt; remodeling project so will talk to all on monday.
&gt; &gt; TTYL Love Joolio
&gt; 
&gt; ....Good luck on your project, you are like a real life &quot;renovate 

my 
&gt; family&quot;...that's cool!(ooh I lust over the head foreman on that 

&gt; show! LOL)
&gt; Thank you very much for your concern, and asking about Richard! 
You 
&gt; are a nice poyson :)
&gt; He is much better... I actually took him for a chiropractic 
&gt; adjustment by my chiro-partner/landlord, Robert... I work in his 
&gt; office, in my own separate little &quot;massage sanctuary&quot; aka room 
:)
&gt; Richard has complete trust in me, and I have complete trust in 
&gt; Robert, having gone to him several times this year, and without 
any 
&gt; exceptions, *always* walking out feeling relief and improved 
&gt; mobility. He is a total pro, and he helped Richard immensely..
&gt; I had Richard write and decorate a little thank you card to Robert 

&gt; and yesterday he called and said he had received it and that it 
was 
&gt; very &quot;funny cute&quot; :) He doesn't normally treat youngsters...
&gt; I was proud of how brave Richard was...My own feeling is that 
since 
&gt; we are such strong role models and can exert very good influences 

on 
&gt; our kids, why wait till they won't listen, or are already in 
trouble.
&gt; I would much rather Richard use natural means of healing than get 

to 
&gt; be another &quot;pain killer popping&quot; person... Our bodies have the 

&gt; capacity to heal themselves, and not many people understand how, 
but 
&gt; I really believe in homeopathic remedies and wholistic healing.
&gt; Again, thanks for asking Jools
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
