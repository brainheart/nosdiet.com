Hi Portia

What's helped me through this is, yes to fence around the diet, but to give myself 
good generous meals when i sit down to have one. I fill the plate. No skimping on the 
butter either. That way I feel satisfied I can have some enjoyment, yet stay within 
the boundaries. 

I think if we go too extreme it's bound to collapse. It's not about deprivation or 
starvation. It's a diet of moderation, that means not getting hung up about it. Three 
tasty proper satisfying meals every day. I've slipped loads of times, but I've lost 
nearly 50 pounds since last summer. I'm now within the 'normal' weight for my 
height.

If you're angry go out and punch something, or scream. Eating is how we learned to 
deal with it as kids. We don't have to do that any more. We're allowed be 
angry.

Welcome back.
Brian

This is what always happens to me on a diet, and I hate it. A few 
weeks thrilled with it, then a slip, then an extra S-day, then a 
slide, then no fence around the diet, then a downward spiral into 
discouragement. Then a few weeks spent looking for the next diet.

I'm sick of it! I love the No-S diet, its elegance, its simplicity, 
its adaptability to anyone's real life. I want to return to it. 

I read about Atkins, that you have one &quot;golden chance&quot;, that if you 

slip and try to return, you won't be successful. You blew it. 

I refuse to believe it. Certainly my will can direct me to any diet 
I choose. Anyone agree? Anyone deviate from the diet and then 
return to renewed success?

Many thanks in advance.
