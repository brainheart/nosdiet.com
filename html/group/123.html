My thoughts on the soda topic:

Soda prevents your body from absorbing vitamins and nutrients. Maybe
knowing that your soda intake cancels out most of the benefits of the
healthier foods you eat will help you think twice when you are making a
decision whether or not to get your soda &quot;fix&quot;.

If you decide to drink the soda and gradually cut back, I'd go with the
regular soda. There are too many health risks associated with the imitation
sugars and the taste of the imitation stuff is much sweeter than sugar 
is.

You can make water a ritual if that will help.
*	Buy a pretty crystal wine glass or pretty tea cup and saucer that you 
use
only for your water.

*	Have lemon wedges prepared and available to squeeze into your water.

*	Put a few cherries into your water or a few pieces of frozen fruit.

*	Put juice into ice trays and use a few frozen juice cubes in your water.

*	Get one of those cool drink stirers.

*	Pamper yourself and put your feet up when you drink your water.

You can make it as much of a ritual as you want it to be. Try it, you will
feel MUCH better. :)

Keep us posted on your progress.

Hi Tammy,

If you've been able to pull off no-s except for soda,
you've got a firm foundation of willpower to stand on.
Congratulations, and give yourself some credit!

Now for the pop issue. As you suggest, pop isn't just
pop. Psychologically, it's a lot more to many people.
It's a break, a ritual, and a drug like cigarrettes.
So we need to find you a surrogate, something to take
it's place.

These are the things pop does and the categories on
which we'll have to evaluate a potential replacement:

Health impact
Ritual
Drug appeal

Water has a positive health impact, not much ritual,
and no drug appeal. Cigarettes are wonderful for
ritual and drug appeal but have a nasty tendency to
kill you. Tea or coffee (easy on the sugar/cream, I
drink mine black) do pretty well in every department.
If that's not up your alley, diet drinks are probably
better than non diet drinks, except 1) I'm suspicious
about what the awful chemicals in there are going to
do to you down the road and 2) the sweetness messes
with the habit forming portion of your brain.

So from best to worse:

Water
Tea (green, especially)
Coffee (black)
Diet Soda
Sugar Soda
Cigarrettes
12 gauge shotgun in mouth

Go as far up the scale as you can... if diet soda is
the best you can do right now then don't beat yourself
up about it. Revisit the issue in a couple months when
you've graduated to the next level of willpower.

&gt; &gt; Congratulations on making it your first weekend,
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; if it was only part of a week and there were some
&gt; &gt; stretchers. If it takes a few days to find your
&gt; &gt; stride, don't worry about it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Strictness is a tool, not an end in itself. But I
&gt; find
&gt; &gt; that strictness makes it easier, and it's what I'd
&gt; &gt; advise most people to try. I'm thrilled that
&gt; Teresa
&gt; &gt; has lost weight using No-s, and I don't begrudge
&gt; her
&gt; &gt; her few candy corns (congratulations, Teresa, and
&gt; &gt; sorry for responding to two posts at once). But I
&gt; &gt; personally would rather not have to worry about
&gt; &quot;some&quot;
&gt; &gt; turning into &quot;way too much.&quot; &quot;No&quot; is harder 
to
&gt; sneak
&gt; &gt; up on. Do what works for you of course, and best
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; luck.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, at the mid point of day 2, let me tell you
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit more about my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;situation.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I work in the athletic department of a high
&gt; school.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not a teacher, I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; not a coach, I just do random stuff. I'm
&gt; basically
&gt; &gt; &gt; an assistant athletic
&gt; &gt; &gt; director, though this district doesn't
&gt; officially
&gt; &gt; &gt; have one. The point of
&gt; &gt; &gt; this, is I make dirt for money, but the
&gt; department
&gt; &gt; &gt; makes up for it by giving
&gt; &gt; &gt; me kick backs. Coke, which we stock the
&gt; machines
&gt; &gt; &gt; throughout the school, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; sell at sporting events, is mine for the taking
&gt; (and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dasani water is what we
&gt; &gt; &gt; sell, which is the sodium containing
&gt; water...yuk).
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is kinda the point where it doesn't matter
&gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm late, so long as I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; in by the time school starts, I'm SUPPOSED to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; there a half hour ahead of
&gt; &gt; &gt; time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway...Yesterday I did well, until I realized
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; was going to dinner with
&gt; &gt; &gt; some old co-workers, we went to Baker's
&gt; &gt; &gt; Square...Couldn't pass up some pie,
&gt; &gt; &gt; so I kinda made it a special day, that was all I
&gt; did
&gt; &gt; &gt; though, no snacks, no
&gt; &gt; &gt; pop.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Today at work, first we get the concession stand
&gt; &gt; &gt; delivery in, so what do I
&gt; &gt; &gt; do for a half hour? Yeah, I stick M&amp;M's and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Snickers on a shelf. That was
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard to pass up, but I made it. Then we get a
&gt; fund
&gt; &gt; &gt; raiser rep. in showing
&gt; &gt; &gt; us his different candy options, and since last
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; he came around, we got
&gt; &gt; &gt; him 2 of our coaches buying from him, he gave us
&gt; &gt; &gt; free samples...We each got
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 5 bags of M&amp;M's. Wow, was it hard not
&gt; eating
&gt; &gt; &gt; them on the way home.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll save 'em for those S days though.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Right now, I'm hungry, and wanting a snack, so
&gt; I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; gonna go mow the lawn. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; guess 2 good things will come about with this,
&gt; &gt; &gt; housework will get done too,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'eh?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again for listening, and giving out this
&gt; &gt; &gt; whole idea.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I'm treading the thin line between fat and

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome and good luck! Here's my take on the
&gt; two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues you raise:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the pop, nothing beats water,
&gt; obviously,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you might want to consider tea as well. If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of those hot water spigots at the cooler
&gt; it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fast, and if they give away pop, they probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; give
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away tea, too. If you are sensitive to
&gt; caffeine,
&gt; &gt; &gt; green
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tea is very weak and supposed to have all
&gt; kinds of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; health benefits. Herbal teas have no caffeine.
&gt; I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crazy about tea, I prefer coffee, but it's
&gt; just so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy and less contentious in terms of health.
&gt; It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hot, so you drink it slow, and the little
&gt; ritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the tea bag seems to fulfill my &quot;looking for
&gt; oral
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distraction&quot; requirement.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the pop-tarts/nutrigrain bars for
&gt; breakfast
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issue, I'm not a picky eater, and since my
&gt; wife
&gt; &gt; &gt; needs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get up way before I do, I tend not to be in
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; huge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rush in the mornings. So I can't speak to your
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from vast personal experience.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've always considered cold cereal pretty
&gt; quick,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it sounds like you need to be out so fast
&gt; you're
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating in the car... not the most conducive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; environment to cheerio consumption. You know,
&gt; 5
&gt; &gt; &gt; extra
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes might put cold cereal within striking
&gt; &gt; &gt; range.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would setting the alarm clock 5 minutes
&gt; earlier be
&gt; &gt; &gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the question? Or could you keep a stash of
&gt; &gt; &gt; cereal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and milk at work? Or do what I do, keep a
&gt; stash of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oatmeal, nuts and dried fruit at work (though
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usually eat this for lunch). If you could do
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these it would expand your horizons
&gt; significantly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are *a lot* of different kinds of low/no
&gt; &gt; &gt; sugar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cereal.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bread is also a big category - it's not just
&gt; &gt; &gt; toasted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wonder or thomases english muffins. Mix it up
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different cheese and a different piece of
&gt; fruit
&gt; &gt; &gt; every
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning and even the same old bread can seem
&gt; &gt; &gt; novel. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't know your exact tastes in this
&gt; depeartment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spend some time seriously scoping out the
&gt; bakery,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cheese and fruit sections are your
&gt; supermarket.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll wrack my brains about it a bit, but for
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being I'd suggest not letting this problem be
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; diet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breaker for you. Pop tarts are clearly out.
&gt; But
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nutrigrain bars might be considered
&gt; temporarily
&gt; &gt; &gt; exempt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until you can think of something less sugary.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, they are *marketed* as healthy, and all
&gt; &gt; &gt; things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considered, are probably less awful for you
&gt; than
&gt; &gt; &gt; pop
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarts. Emphasis on 'temporary,' and don't let
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every day. Hopefully you'll get enough
&gt; &gt; &gt; alternatives
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested here in this group (and by the
&gt; mother of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invention) that you won't have to resort to
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often/at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't remember
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question I had, but it wasn't even about
&gt; &gt; &gt; weight
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loss. I decided
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this may very well be the way I've been
&gt; &gt; &gt; looking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for to loose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight all this time. I've gained ~60
&gt; pounds in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last 4 years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most being in the last 2 years. The other
&gt; night
&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to stop drinking pop like I do...Which
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constantly. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard since I get it free at work, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; bottled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water here has a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant amount of sodium, so you just
&gt; end up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more thirsty after
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drinking it, but I'm gonna do it. This is
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step up for me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I'm pretty sure I can handle most of it
&gt; &gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the bat, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of it soon. Thanks for making this
&gt; &gt; &gt; availible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now for a question that I know has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; addressed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not &quot;to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfaction.&quot; Breakfast, I wake up
&gt; litterally
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes before I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to be at work, and it's a 20 minute
&gt; &gt; &gt; drive.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (yes I'm late
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every day, but that's a whole 'nother story)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nutrigrain bars and pop
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarts have been a Godsend to me. Not only
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm a VERY picky
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eater, and most common breakfast foods are
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liking. I do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love a good bowl of Cheerios or something
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; that,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I frankly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't have the time for them. Toast is
&gt; great,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; english muffins
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too...but every day? I don't think I'd like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that...Any other ideas
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out there...Maybe there was some of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; addressed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I either
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glanced over it or missed it in the archive,
&gt; &gt; &gt; sorry
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it is just a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repeat. Thanks for the help!!
