I gave up soda on a whim during spring break one year. Wondered if I 
could really go all week. I indulged in grape juice all the time, 
which is super sweet and a lot richer than soda. I made it a week 
with no trouble. Figured grape juice by the jug wasn't too healthy, 
either, so I cut back to some grape and lots of apple. A.J. is still 
awfully sweet to be drinking all the time, so juice became more of a 
treat and water became my new addiction. Sometimes it was SUPER hard 
to resist grabbing a can of Pepsi~but every time you resist, you grow 
a little. Eventually, I promise, it WILL become easier!

Six years later, I buy bottled water (because the city water has 
strange flavors). My favorite brand is Blu Botol. I can only find it 
at a couple gas stations, but the bottles look so cool! I know it 
sounds silly, but when you've got a cool looking bottle, you may find 
it easier to drink more water. (isn't it funny the tricks we play on 
our minds?) Also, on my college campus, tons of students have Nalgene 
bottles, which are unbreakable, reusable bottles in a variety of 
sizes, sold at sporting goods stores. People who invest in a Nalgene 
end up carrying it everywhere they go and drinking a lot of water.

These days, I find soda sickening sweet. But if it sounds really good 
to me, I'll drink it. After one sip, I'm done. I do drink Italian 
sodas and punch...so I've labelled myself a soda social drinker.

Hopefully this will encourage someone to kick the soda habit! :)
