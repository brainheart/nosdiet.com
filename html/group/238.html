Hi Tracy,

I'm wondering if since you are growing/raising/hunting
most of your own food (which is great from
culinary-spiritual standpoint), you have a lot of
extra around, and feel an obligation to eat it? I know
I feel an almost moral pang about wasting food, and I
haven't even had any kind of relationship with it
while it was alive. If so, you might want to think
about how to deal with this &quot;production issue.&quot; It's
definitely easier to resist the call of the fridge if
there isn't a whole lot in it.

The water bit seems right on. You'll find a bunch of
other pro-water posts in the archive.

Welcome and good luck! And thanks for the detailed
post. It's helpful for people to see the exact issues
other people are confronting. Feel free to bug us as
other things come up.

&gt; Hello! I found the No S diet site and list while
&gt; doing a search 
&gt; on &quot;overeating&quot; last night.
&gt; 
&gt; After totally bloating myself to the point of being
&gt; sick, I decided 
&gt; enough is enough, and it's time to make a major
&gt; change in how I think 
&gt; and feel about food. I have really gained a ton of
&gt; weight, and the 
&gt; way my dh eyes me every so often, I wonder sometimes
&gt; if he is going 
&gt; to inform me that my butt needs it's own zip code
&gt; ;-) On the happy 
&gt; side, my doctor refused to believe that I weighed
&gt; what I do, so at 
&gt; least I must hide it well. LOL. Doesn't help the
&gt; fact that 
&gt; according to the BMI calculators, I am &quot;obese&quot; :(
&gt; 
&gt; Winters are truly the worst for me, since winters
&gt; are long and cold, 
&gt; and I get bored, and guess what-- eat. I guess I'll
&gt; feel better 
&gt; about shoveling snow now &lt;g&gt; Mental note: must look
&gt; for 
&gt; sledgehammer...
&gt; 
&gt; We live in a very rural area of Idaho, and we grow,
&gt; raise, or hunt 
&gt; most of our food. We also raise dairy goats. I
&gt; have nine does that 
&gt; will be kidding in about 4 weeks, so the busy season
&gt; will start 
&gt; again. We also raise pigs, calves, chickens,
&gt; rabbits, lambs, and the 
&gt; occasional other creature. In my spare time &lt;g&gt; I
&gt; work at home doing 
&gt; corporate transcription.
&gt; 
&gt; I like the idea of the No S because it is simple. I
&gt; think even I can 
&gt; remember those 3 rules :)
&gt; 
&gt; Just as an interesting add on, I was watching my
&gt; toddler (who will 
&gt; turn 3 on Christmas morn) eat her dinner last
&gt; night....
&gt; She would take one bite, chew chew chew, and then
&gt; take a drink of 
&gt; water. Then she would pause, babble about whatever
&gt; her brillant 
&gt; little mind had come up with, and then repeat.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm. Have you ever actually taken a drink of water
&gt; after EVERY 
&gt; bite. You sure can't overeat when you do it! &lt;g&gt; 
&gt; And a pause for 
&gt; conversation between bites....hmmm. Interesting
&gt; concept, no? :)
&gt; 
&gt; I know at my house, we are all too guilty of sitting
&gt; in silence and 
&gt; shoveling as much as possible in as quick as we can.
&gt; That's a habit 
&gt; we are all going to work on, especially my 12 yr
&gt; old.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, sorry to turn this into a book :) I am
&gt; happily going through 
&gt; the archives now, and hopefully will be making a big
&gt; change for 
&gt; myself.
&gt;
