&gt; Hi deb, that was hysterical. I can just imagine him. What would of 

&gt; been interesting is to tape it, and show it to him later so he 
could see how he was acting.I used to work for a pediatrician and 
he was forever saying that it didnt really affect kids.

....Jools, What do doctors really know anyway? LOL
When I was pregnant I had gestational diabetes and by 7 months in 
Richard was already registering like *NINE* lbs on the ultrasounds 
already, then he decided to come out at 10lbs 13oz, but let's just 
say 11lbs! (plus I was in labor for more than 40 hours!)
During the monitoring phase of the pregnancy I had, I think about 
three ultrasounds or four? And when they found out I had the 
diabetes, kindof late in the game, at 7 months they would also check 
his heart rate regularly...Occasionally he would be in a sleep 
state, so his resting heartbeat would be fairly slow, and actually a 
little hard to read, so in order to get a better reading on how his 
heart sounded, they would give me about 1/4 or 1/3 of a cup of 
soda...Guess what? That jumpstarted the motors alright, since I was 
diabetic this sugar went straight from my blood to his and the heart 
monitor showed a change in heart rate that was, as best as I can 
recall, from resting around 70bpm to 150bpm...
It sure woke him up! Kind of scary when you see less informed, 
lower education parents actually put soda into their toddler kids 
bottles! I lived in New Orleans at the time, this was actually not 
uncommon. Infact I gained all that weight from eating New Orleans 
food for 2 years, and they are not known for Lean Cuisine!
Po'Boys, Bread Pudding, Fried Catfish, and those phenomenal Begnets 
(I am not spelling that one right, but basically those are Freshly 
Deep Fried Donuts with Confectioners Sugar on them)
They are a worthy S day dessert, eaten with Hot Cocoa accompaniment!
Now I am hungry.
Help!
Peace,
Deb :)
