Another lovely combination for a salad is tomato and Mozzarella cheese 
with
basil leaves and balsamic vinegar. I add soy sauce to the balsamic vinegar
too.

&gt; &gt; HI deb, this sounds so good,will defintely try it. I make one
&gt; similar called Eden salad it is with fresh spinch,chopped red
&gt; cabbage,romaine and green leaf(or any combo you like) with mandarin
&gt; oranges,chopped pecans,feta cheese, and chicken or shrimp. I use a
&gt; raspberry vinagrette and olive oil dressing(mix according to taste)I
&gt; copied it from an Amish restaurant in Sarasota.it is my fave ! I
&gt; think the four smaller meals is fine.No rules against that and if 
it
&gt; keeps you from bingeing later yeah !!! I personally save time one
&gt; salads by buying it prewashed ready to eat. I am more apt to eat
&gt; salad if its easy to make.For busy MOm like so many of on on NOS,
&gt; quick and easy is the key to eating healthy for our families.Let us
&gt; know how it goes with the 4 small meals. Jools
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here's a great salad to try out :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mix Romaine lettuce, mesclun mixed greens, grape tomatoes,
&gt; cucumber,
&gt; &gt; shredded red cabbage, some carrots, and two tablspoons of red
&gt; kidney
&gt; &gt; beans (for protein) Garnish with 2 teaspoons of raisins and slices
&gt; &gt; of 4 or 5 fresh strawberries :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Deb's dressing (Newman move yer'ass over!)
&gt; &gt; Juice of one orange, half teaspoon of lime juice, two sesame 
oil,
&gt; &gt; two splashes of rice wine vinegar, splash of balsamic vinegar,
&gt; half
&gt; &gt; teaspoon of mustard, two teaspoons of mayonaise, some salt and
&gt; &gt; pepper to taste.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This salad is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the tastebuds,
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; it's lively mix of red and green colors and sweet and tangy
&gt; tastes...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For the last two weeks or so, I have noticed that I have almost 
no
&gt; &gt; appetite in the mornings, and we usually eat dinner between 5 
and
&gt; &gt; 6:30.... Rather than go back for various snacks after dinner, 
I
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; decided that I will be changing my three meals to 4... My
&gt; breakfast
&gt; &gt; is usually pretty small, and I don't think that's going to change
&gt; &gt; soon... It's really hard when I'm trying to be quick and get
&gt; dinner
&gt; &gt; ready for my son and me to take the time to prepare a really 
great
&gt; &gt; salad... I will try to do this in advance if I can think ahead,
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; for now, I consider this salad as my version of &quot;dessert&quot;... 
And
&gt; &gt; though it breaks with the 3 plate rule, it still is healthful
&gt; stuff
&gt; &gt; and *not* Ben and Jerry's! Sometimes I don't feel like I need
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; but lately I have, so this is going to be an experiment for me 
in
&gt; &gt; bending one of the NoS rules... I can't decide whether to consider
&gt; &gt; this a meal unto itself, or just a second course in an extended
&gt; &gt; dinner... No matter what, it still beats endless trips to the
&gt; fridge
&gt; &gt; once dinner is done, into the wee wee hours...
&gt; &gt; Hey Richard is playing guitar and singing for me now, a first
&gt; class
&gt; &gt; serenade! Guess what he's playing folks... Well one quick hint,
&gt; his
&gt; &gt; mother is a Deadhead, so for tonight it's &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot; 
by
&gt; &gt; the Grateful Dead! What a little chip of the oldish block :)
&gt; &gt; Hope you are all having great weeks so far! :)
&gt; &gt; Love and Peace,
&gt;
