Chel -- I absolutely MUST pack my breakfast and lunch at night before I go to bed. I 
usually do it right before cleaning the kitchen. I'm not rushed trying to figure out 
what's available and I have TIME to prepare stuff. there is no way I could get it all 
together in the morning. Today for breakfast I had a half whole wheat pita, toasted 
with 3 slices canadian bacon, 1 string cheese and a small applesauce. For lunch I had 
a turkey and pepper jack sandwich on 9 grain bread with mustard, mayo &amp; lettuce, 
a small bag of baby carrots and a sandwich sized ziploc bag of cherries. So far, so 
good.

Mary --- we can do it! I do the same thing - when I work especially - so hard to 
plan, I just end up grabbing a mish mash of stuff that will do - it's the last thing 
I want to think about at 5 in the morning when I know I wont be home for another 15 
hours!

-------------- Original message -------------- 

&gt; Thanks Sunshine -- the hardest part is going to be changing my way of thinking. 

&gt; I like to take my breakfast &amp; lunch to work, so I am trying to plan them 
out. 
&gt; And I realized I don't know how to plan 'normal' meals. How sad is that??? I 

&gt; am trying to make good choices, but not fretting about it too much. BTW -- I 

&gt; ate too much at dinner tonight, but I have now gotten through my first day. 

&gt; WOOHOO!!

&gt; Hi Mary. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have successfully used NoS to lose 7 pounds (my goal) and keep it 

&gt; off. It feels wonderful to have so much freedom within so few 
&gt; boundaries. 
&gt; 
&gt; And I love not having to count calories or keep a food log. 
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome aboard!
