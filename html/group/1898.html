Sorry for the delay, I've been a little out of this
week. It's nice that we've got such an active and
welcoming group that I can afford to be out of it for
a bit, but still, it's rude for the host to ignore his
guests, however well they seem to be mingling.

&gt; I have been s'ing for about a month now and have had
a
&gt; five pound loss! I remember my first S weekend. I
can giggle about
&gt; it now but boy that Sunday was very bad. 

Congratulations! Newbies take note: don't stress about
the first weekends. You'll overeat. It's ok. Build the
weekday habits and in time they'll get in line. I
wouldn't even worry about losing weight the first few
weeks, just focus on building habit.

&gt; I have limited my supersized snacking and sweets to
one very good
&gt; Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream bar on Saturday night! 
And let me tell
&gt; you that ice cream never tasted so good! 

It's good that you've identified something you really
want on your S-day. Thinking of the best S to enjoy is
more important than worrying about limiting yourself.

&gt; I weighed myself this morning instead of Monday
because I thought
&gt; after S days I may not get an accurate number (or
one I want). Well
&gt; I took off 2 lbs this month which makes it 6 total. 
That is 6 in
&gt; about a month and a half. I won't do this again
until the end of
&gt; November or beginning of December.

This is great, Lee. It's amazing what progress you've
made. And I'm not just talking pounds: it's your
attitude, your confidence. Don't let your
transylvanian halloween throw you. Keep at it. You're
an inspiration to all those who are having a rough
start.

&gt; Hi all
&gt; I'm starting this for the 1st time tomorrow but am
still a little
&gt; confused.

I hope Deb and Julie answered your questions to your
satisfaction and that you had a good first day.
Welcome!

&gt; what sort of things do you all eat for lunch?

My default lunch is oatmeal. Not ideal for the road.
But lunch is probably the easiest no-s meal, there's
less of a tradition of sweets and multiple courses.
How about a good old sandwich? Portable, versatile.
simple, and as healthy/tasty as you want it to be.

&gt; I am 1/4 of an inch away from being down a full

&gt; I did a victory screech and my own version of the
&gt; dance that those 
&gt; guys do when they score a touchdown in football.
&gt; I am also able to put on a shirt that has been too
&gt; small for me for 
&gt; a couple of months, this is great :)

You deserve this, Debbie, not just as a reward for
your own discipline but for all the help you've given
others in this group. I'm so happy for you.

Anyone else? Please pipe up if I've missed you.
