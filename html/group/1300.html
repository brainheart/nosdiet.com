Okay, I'm really in trouble now...

Every day this week, I've broken the rules. So I need to start over. The 

old diet mentality says start over on Tuesday, because Friday is only one 

weekday, then there are the two S days when the rules don't strictly apply, 

then there's another &quot;S&quot; (special) day, Labor Day. So I might as well wait 

and start the three-week count on Tuesday.

I started No S a month ago and had been doing well, really enjoying the 

structure, etc. Then for some reason on Monday, I looked at the vending 

machine in the break room at work and realized it had been almost a month 

since I'd bought anything from it. And wouldn't you know, for the rest of 

the day, all I kept thinking about was what was in that vending machine. 

Eventually, I bought something from it, and every day this week, I've bought 

something from it twice a day.

The brain is really tricky. I keep trying to outsmart myself, but the more 

I try to resist, the more I can't stop thinking about it and the more I give 

in.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Valerie
