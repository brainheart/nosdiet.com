I have gotten older, more sedentary due to work, and so have gained 
25lbs neatly around my midsection (the danger zone). My arms and 
legs remain thin so I look extra silly. Some days I long for those 
comfy maternity pants I stupidly thought I no longer needed after 
finishing the procreative phase of my life.
I used to lose weight easily on the &quot;Smoke Constantly, Drink Tonnes 

of Coffee Diet&quot;, but that seems to have been ruled unhealthy lately, 

so I tried a modified &quot;Drink Water Constantly, Eat Only Things That 

are Green&quot; which worked for a while(perhaps due to the fabulous 
workout I got by going to the bathroom 87 times a day), but the 
weight returned when I began to eat other colours.
I find I hate those Atkins types who are losing weight like crazy all 
around me by eating entire herds of animals. I think its fun to 
congratulate them on their ketosis by presenting them with breath 
mints. They have motivated me to find another way.
I am a vegetarian(a little octo-lavo) and I know some people hate me 
for it, but really I'm not pushy about it, it's a personal thing. So 
as I searched the internet for weight loss plans and was bombarded by 
these high meat diets I became a little discouraged. And then this! 
Wow, put less food in my face and swing a hammer around. I cannot 
wait for this to work. I hope the creator(sorry name eludes me now) 
becomes wildly famous and spin-off diet plans follow.
