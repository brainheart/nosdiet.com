For women of child bearing age there's also the sugar craving that comes
with parts of the menstrual cycle.This may be related to a need for B
vitamins. These tend to be found in carbohydrate foods and the body gets 
its
signals mixed. Women of this age-group would benefit from a diet high in 
B
vitamins.Supplements are quite good if taken in correct amounts.

&gt; Aw Bonnie, that would be a killer for me if I had to be around ice
&gt; cream as part of my job... While I was going to school this time
&gt; round, I had two part time jobs, one at a great bagel place, and the
&gt; other was Starbucks...Talk about constant tempatation...I would never
&gt; choose to put myself in a food service job again, it was a major
&gt; eating trap, esp. Starbucks! All they had to choose from was
&gt; pastries, so after 3 months I was completely a carb addict.
&gt; At least I hated their coffee because those mix drinks they have are
&gt; pretty laden with sugar too.
&gt; That whole argument about how sugary treats lead to an addictive-like
&gt; reaction is pretty true.
&gt; Since they don't give you any long term sustinance and make your
&gt; blood sugar go up and down to extremes, you don't feel
&gt; satisfied...Then you wind up one or two hours later with that
&gt; hungry &quot;craving something&quot; feeling, and guess what you wind 
up
&gt; wanting? Protein, fiber and fat are necessary to feel satisfied, as
&gt; well as an adequate intake of water.
&gt; So your son's an unadulterated hippie?
&gt; Cool : )
&gt; What about you? They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree!
&gt; I still remember, as a kid, hearing Uncle Johns Band and thinking
&gt; that it didn't sound like anything I ever heard before. My baby
&gt; boomer uncle was responsible for passing on the music to me.
&gt; That is my kind of comfort food!

&gt; &gt; Dear Debbie,
&gt; &gt; Can't stop walking because it does keep me from gaining, and 
I
&gt; do lose a

&gt; steady and

his
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; downfall is we sell ice cream in our shop, but in spite of it 
,the
&gt; walking
&gt; &gt; really works great for him in spite of the occasional cone....well,
&gt; soon the
&gt; &gt; ice cream -hence temptation season- will be over. No, I enjoy 
my
&gt; walks we
&gt; &gt; have a great time all chatting and staying healthy every morning,
&gt; before we
&gt; &gt; must stay coped up working all day. By the way, you guessed it,
&gt; my &quot;cute&quot;
&gt; &gt; son is a total hippie, and has been since he was born, and a 
Dead
&gt; Head. He
&gt; &gt; follows the Dead alot, and his music, what he doesn't compose
&gt; himself, is a
&gt; &gt; lot of Grateful Dead, Blue Grass, &amp; 70's.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Valerie :)
&gt; &gt; I am curious to know what stuff you are craving from this vending
&gt; &gt; machine? If its sweets, or salty stuff? Crunchy stuff etc...Or 
is
&gt; &gt; it just that you cant handle the impulse thing that happens when 
you
&gt; &gt; walk by?
&gt; &gt; I feel that if your meal is really great, and even borderline
&gt; &gt; fattening, you will not be as hungry as to need a snack. But
&gt; &gt; probably you are just seeing the machine and going into a programmed
&gt; &gt; response of getting something, we all have that in us.
&gt; &gt; I suggest just staying out of that area if possible...Is that 
the
&gt; &gt; only place you can eat your lunch? Can you do an al fresco thing?
&gt; &gt; Like Reinhard said, this is all about &quot;delay&quot;
&gt; &gt; Probably 90 percent or maybe more, of our need to eat unplanned 
food
&gt; &gt; is just an impulsive reaction...Why beat yourself up like you
&gt; &gt; committed one of the seven deadly sins? When something looks
&gt; &gt; inviting it's very normal to want it.
&gt; &gt; If I go to Dunkin Donuts with my son, it is like torture for me 
and
&gt; &gt; usually I get something for both of us when this happens.
&gt; &gt; It's a trap that can be avoided.
&gt; &gt; Think of those vending machines as irresistable, recognize that 
they
&gt; &gt; are interfering with your goal of long term success
&gt; &gt; (If you really are going to the machine 2 x's a day this is a 
pretty
&gt; &gt; obvious hindrance to your goal) You don't have to trick your 
brain
&gt; &gt; you have to just avoid the situation alltogether so your poor 
brain
&gt; &gt; has a break.
&gt; &gt; Are you hungry when these impulses arive? Or is it just pure 
visual
&gt; &gt; temptation? If you are infact hungry, probably you are skimping 
on
&gt; &gt; good meals.
&gt; &gt; If you really must eat that unhealthy snack try to make it part 
of
&gt; &gt; your meal, something that is planned into your three meals
&gt; lifestyle,
&gt; &gt; like Reinhard says in the homepage info...At least you will be
&gt; making
&gt; &gt; it part of your meal, and not further influencing that snacking
&gt; &gt; inbetween behavior...Then, to add bang for the buck, eat only 
half
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; 2/3 of the irresistable snack, very very very slowly and throw 
the
&gt; &gt; rest away.
&gt; &gt; If you are not 100% with all three of our
&gt; &gt; Three commandments
&gt; &gt; No Sugar
&gt; &gt; No Snacks
&gt; &gt; No Seconds
&gt; &gt; that is normal...You are not an android...Figure out which rule 
is
&gt; &gt; the most challenging, and doing you the most damage, and really
&gt; &gt; garner all your hard artillery to figure out how you can make 
that
&gt; &gt; one stick.
&gt; &gt; Also, you might think of leaving your petty cash at home so you
&gt; &gt; simply cant buy those snacks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope these ideas help :)
&gt; &gt; Good luck

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I'm really in trouble now...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Every day this week, I've broken the rules. So I need to 
start
&gt; &gt; over. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; old diet mentality says start over on Tuesday, because Friday 
is
&gt; &gt; only one
&gt; &gt; &gt; weekday, then there are the two S days when the rules don't
&gt; &gt; strictly apply,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then there's another &quot;S&quot; (special) day, Labor Day. So I 
might as
&gt; &gt; well wait
&gt; &gt; &gt; and start the three-week count on Tuesday.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I started No S a month ago and had been doing well, really
&gt; enjoying
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; structure, etc. Then for some reason on Monday, I looked at 
the
&gt; &gt; vending
&gt; &gt; &gt; machine in the break room at work and realized it had been 
almost
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; month
&gt; &gt; &gt; since I'd bought anything from it. And wouldn't you know, for 
the
&gt; &gt; rest of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the day, all I kept thinking about was what was in that 
vending
&gt; &gt; machine.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Eventually, I bought something from it, and every day this 
week,
&gt; &gt; I've bought
&gt; &gt; &gt; something from it twice a day.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The brain is really tricky. I keep trying to outsmart myself, 
but
&gt; &gt; the more
&gt; &gt; &gt; I try to resist, the more I can't stop thinking about it and 
the
&gt; &gt; more I give
&gt; &gt; &gt; in.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
