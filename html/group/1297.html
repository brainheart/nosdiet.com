&gt; Lets face it..Our fast food society usually doesn't encourage steps 
1-
&gt; 3 and skips straight to 4...

It's funny you should mention this.

I recently had a couple of live crowns done (where &quot;live&quot; means 
&quot;the
tooth under the crown is ground down, but the root is not removed&quot;;
no root canal =3D tooth still has feeling, quite a bit more than it did
when there was no crown in fact). Bottom middle molar on both sides.
One side has settled down a lot, the other's still working on it.

This means that I have to be careful where I chew. I don't really have
to *avoid* much, but I do have to evaluate whether or not the worse
side can handle it, and whether or not to use the big crown or the=20
smaller molar behind it, and so on. It also means that I have to
think about whether or not food is sufficiently chewed, since I can't
put my mouth on autopilot.

I used to always finish eating long before my girlfriend. Now it's
the other way around! The end result? I serve myself less food. Not
so little to stay hungry, but the outcome of giving myself a serving
and a half is eating alone for the last third of the meal, or feeling
silly that I'm not done yet. I still enjoy the food just as much
without that extra bit: I still spend just as long eating it, and
I still feel full at the end (where before I'd probably have felt
overfull), and it still tastes the same.

I have no idea if conscious chewing would help anyone else with=20
downsizing portions, but it might be worth a try.

Ouch live crowns! Sounds hideous :)
Did you opt for novacaine? lol
Actually, you know that old saying about waiting a bit to decide on=20
whether or not to eat seconds
(not for no ssers of course!)
Even though our sympathetic nervous system is lickety split fast and=20
we don't even have to think about reacting when a fight or flight=20
situation arises, our parasympathetic nervous system, the &quot;rest and=20
digest&quot; part of us, is much slower... and unfortunately there is a=20
considerable lag time between the time the food goes in to our=20
stomachs and the time we really feel satiated.
The hypothalamus is the part of the brain which registers if we are=20
hungry or thirsty, empty or full...But it is a little slow at doing=20
this, so if a person waits until they &quot;feel&quot; thirsty to drink, 
by=20
that time we are already somewhat dehydrated. It senses feelings of=20
hunger the same way. I believe it takes at least ten to fifteen=20
minutes to really feel full, so when in doubt just slow down you pace=20

I enjoyed your story, good luck Richard

It's really not that bad. There's freezing, but it's more because the=20
tooth *might* get tender, and because of all of the working around the
gums. By the time you need a crown you're past the enamel anyhow,
though, and preparing for a crown means just grinding down the dentine
further -- not grinding down to the root.=20

From: Reinhard Engels &lt;beautiful_idiot@...&gt;
Subject: Re: Need a little support

Hi Lee,

I'm happy to hear you're still with us... got a little
nervous when your posts dropped off.

The best encouragement I can give is just to remind
you how close, even after fallings off and dubious
S-days, you or anyone is to forming this new habit. It
may be a marathon rather than a sprint, but once you
get past that first little hump, you can largely
coast. So just concentrate on getting to that hump. If
you fall off again before you make it, no big deal,
you've lost days, maybe a couple weeks, that's it. Get
right back on. Once little point of clarification: the
hump (as I've somewhat arbitrarily defined it) is
after three weeks strict, not three weeks since first
attempt. So if you fall off, reset the clock, but take
comfort that the clock is short.

You mentioned some scale related freak outs. Obsessive
scale watching seems to me the output end of the same
mentality behind calorie accounting. Sure it makes
sense, on a descriptive, scientific level, but:=20

1) you don't have the equipment to measure accurately.
Consumer scales are woefully inadequate, and even if
you have a medical grade scale at home, there are all
kinds of other factors, food and water in your gut,
muscle being heavier than fat, etc. that are
critically important but difficult to measure.

2) even if you did, you don't have the time to keep
track of all this stuff. Are you really going to stick
it all in excel and calculate moving averages and what
not?=20

3) even if you did, you don't have the vulcan
detachment that would be required to impartially
analyze all this stuff. Even scientists have trouble
with this. Ever heard this quote &quot;statistics are a
form of wish fulfillment?&quot; In the case of diet, I'll
add &quot;nightmare fulfillment.&quot; Plateaus and
insignificant upticks will throw you.

I know what you're afraid of. That without the scale
you have nothing, that your powers of self deception
will have free reign. I have two things to say to
this:=20

1) weighing yourself once in a while, as a sanity
check, to keep you honest, is fine. But I'd say once a
week, tops, and take the numbers with a large grain of
kosher salt. Once a month is better. I didn't step on
a scale until I was 2 months into no-s.

2) the real goal is to be able to get a sense of how
you are doing by how you look and feel, just as you're
learning to get a gut sense of how much food you're
consuming by funneling it all through discreet, well
observed channels. Hard? Yes. Mushy? Yes. But also
necessary.

Best of luck, and keep on keeping us posted,

Reinhard
