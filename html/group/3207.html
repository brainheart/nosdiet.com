&gt; 1)Get rid of the sweets in your home- your kids can live with out 

&gt; them too as can your husband if there is one..
.....Good advice Jools! Make temptation, less tempting by just 
eliminating that stuff. Probably at least (non clinical opinion here)
fifty percent of our binge type eating comes when no one else is 
watching and there just happens to be some stray cookies lying 
around in the cupboard... But mainly this is often just impulse 
eating. Impulses pass usually... If it doesn't and your are bent on 
having your sweet, I guess that's different... If you need to get 
out of your pj's, go to the market and get that treat at 10 pm, or 
whenever, chances are you will be less likely to do that many times 
in a week, as opposed to daily temptations with no inconvenience 
involved because they are already in the house. Make it less 
convenient to go off plan.

most of all we are all here for you- dont worry about reporting 
weight loss or gains. we are here for support- there are
&gt; some great people here and a few crazys too. LOL.

....Jools speak for yourself gf! LOL...who are you talking about? 
LOL.... I for one like to be referred to as both &quot;Great and Crazy&quot;.
(lol...&quot;snort&quot;..)

&gt; BTW- whoever has told you that being 4&quot;11 means you can only eat 
1-
2 times a day is full of you know what !!!

....Yeah Jools! Phooey to them! Don't listen to them. Listen to you! 
Your body has the answer and NoS is very healthy... Maybe you just 
need to be patient and wait for your appetite to slowly change... I 
was overloading my plate for the first, hmmm, at least the first 3 
or 4 months, but that just stopped being necessary and now I am 
eating much less, portionwise, and not feeling deprived. Well just 
don't listen to those &quot;expert&quot; bozos! They are full of something, 

and it stinks! That seems ridiculous... I guess that means I have 
to feed my son less than three meals a day eh?... Well newsflash.. 
Richard is looking about as slim and healthy as he has ever been... 
He eats medium sized meals, stops when he's full, and only has about 
3 esses a week, and sometimes only 2...

&gt;so forget about what those quacks say gf.. you are smarter 
than that. or you would still be on there quack diets !

.....Quack is one of my very favorite words! LOL...
Nice rant Jools! We love ya sis :)
Have a great S'n weekend all!
Enjoy your treats, and snacks!
Love,
Deb
