&gt; I have been eating out of control and last night I 
&gt; had all kinmds of 
&gt; nightmares where I had no control of things and was 
&gt; crying and screaming in 
&gt; my sleep. I had better get a grip on things!

&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard is so right about how good it feels to not 
&gt; snack. To resist gives 
&gt; such a feeling of pride. Even though no one else in 
&gt; the room notices. LOL 
&gt; 
&gt; What I have been telling myself, if this is useful 
&gt; information to anyone, is 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;you tasted that before, you don't need to taste it 
&gt; again, and an 
&gt; opportunity to taste it again will come around at 
&gt; some point in your life&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This self talk seems to get me through my weak 
&gt; moments. :-) 
&gt; 
&gt; For example: chips. I have consumed enough of 
&gt; those to know what the taste 
&gt; 
&gt; is long after I pass over to the other side. And 
&gt; when the chance to have 
&gt; them comes about, like a dinner buffet at a picnic, 
&gt; I find it easy to resist 
&gt; 
&gt; them again as I make good food choices. 
&gt; 
&gt; And what can be fun about the good food choices is 
&gt; that 
&gt; &quot;I have not tasted this before....what a treat!&quot; 
&gt; LOL 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, to all.......have a great noSdietday! 
&gt;
