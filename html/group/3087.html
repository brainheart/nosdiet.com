Hi Mayo,

Thanks for checking in and sorry for the long delay on
this acknowledgement. I'm thrilled &quot;half essed&quot; is
working for you, and not only because it's funny. I
finally stuck a reference on the home page with links
to this post and your original. I don't want to burden
you with having to be an exemplar, but you know, I've
found it's one of those rare burdens that actually
helps keep you straight. 

The psychology as you present it here is right on, for
all the esses, I think, and beautifully put. Thank you
and may your personal success be proportional to your
inspiration of others.

Reinhard

&gt; Heya guys,
&gt; 
&gt; How weird--and possibly lame, though I'm not
&gt; complaining by any means
&gt; :-)--is it that just setting the no-sweets rule is
&gt; making me stick to
&gt; it. I'm starting to think that it's not so much a
&gt; question of will
&gt; power for me, but my &quot;why not&quot; attitude toward food.
&gt; Before, I would
&gt; usually shrug and ok everything, but having the rule
&gt; gives me a good
&gt; automatic response--that's &quot;no, thanks&quot;--to go to
&gt; instead of me going
&gt; through the stage where I consider if I want the
&gt; sweet because the
&gt; answer's always going to be &quot;sure, why not.&quot; So,
&gt; yay! It's working out
&gt; really well for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Not following the other s's is working out well too,
&gt; since I've been
&gt; doing basic weight training (squats, push-ups,
&gt; sit-ups) and I want to
&gt; make sure I have enough protein and nutrients. The
&gt; cool thing about
&gt; no-sweets is that I eat around the rule. I've been
&gt; eating a lot more
&gt; veggies than I have before, and eating the protein
&gt; helps me not feel
&gt; hungry. I've actually wondered if I'm eating enough
&gt; of the proper
&gt; foods, but that's probably just paranoia;
&gt; volume-wise, I have plenty
&gt; since I'm eating such bulky and low-glycemic foods.
&gt; The extra fiber's
&gt; been, erm, uncomfortable on my digestive system,
&gt; heh, so I'm hanging
&gt; in there until I adjust. Btw, Deb, you inspired me
&gt; to have peanut
&gt; butter on my bananas, and they were delish! (They
&gt; were too ripe to put
&gt; honey on, and I don't have cocoa powder.) Thanks for
&gt; the suggestion!
&gt; Peanut butter has been my mainstay for the past few
&gt; weeks, and it
&gt; looks like cottage cheese might be my next phase.
&gt; I'm feeling a dairy
&gt; urge. Anyone have any tips for cottage cheese? :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Have a great day!
&gt; 
&gt; mayo
