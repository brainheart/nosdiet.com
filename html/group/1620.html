What I have been doing is combining past knowledge with the NoSlivingplan. 

For instance, keeping some track of making sure I get all the food groups,
and when I am in a particular hungry mood, making sure that particular 
meal
falls under so many calories. Yesterday was our city's big football game 
at
1PM. I &lt;skipped&gt; lunch and when we put out all the snacks, I fixed myself 
a
500 calorie plate to enjoy during the game. I drank my diet soda pops
instead of beer, and later enjoyed a nice dinner with my family. Because 
it
was a Sunday, the extra that I allowed myself was 50 calories of butter 
on
my potato that I would not have done on my strict days. 

So, for my treat day, I had my regular breakfast, instead of lunch I had 
a
500 calorie plate of treat foods (chips, salsa, fresh vegetables, dip, 
bite
of cheese and meat) my regular dinner of 1 small boiled potato, 4 oz meat,
1/2 cup corn with an added 50 calories of butter. So calorie wise, I was 
50
over plus the diet soda pops. I had thought about making my treat choice 
a
100 calorie cookie, but wanted the taste of butter on my potato more. 

I also make a choice on which of my off days I am going to allow myself
something off food plan. This weekend it was during the game, and I had
calories that were fat, like the 125 calories of corn chips with salsa. 
I
didn't have any excuse to not follow the plan on Saturday, such as an event
or gathering. 

Another thing I do is I make a choice on my off days. Like I do on the
strict days. On the off days, I do not have cake, fries, ice cream, and
fattening sandwiches. What I do is pick ONE of those things to taste that
day. And I try to make it a taste. Not a 1000 calorie taste! More like 
a
500 or less taste. It is amazing how a good a 250 calorie taste of
something satisfies since I have not had it for a month. And if I am not
hungry after I had my good NoSlivingplan meals, I have no problem with
denying myself that desert I was planning on for another week. 

The choices I make on the strict days is do I want this one cup volume 
of
high calorie food, for example, macaroni and cheese, or do I want these 
4
cups of delicious chewy fresh vegetables with 3 oz of beef? Sometimes I 
go
for the more volume food.

All in all, it is a juggling event. But fun, and I am making progress.

Kate

Subject: [nosdiet] another &quot;s&quot; day


today is my 4th official day of the no &quot;s&quot; diet, with today being an s 
day.
i 
have really overdone it this weekend, i am actually looking forward to 

returing to the structure of the weekday. would anyone care to give me 
a
list of the 
foods that they ate one day this weekend, i am afraid that i have taken the 

concept of an &quot;s &quot; day way out of proportion.
(cake, candy, cookies, ice cream, seafood salad sadnwitches, chili-chees 

fries....)
thanks so much ! donna o
