Thanks for all the info. I'm taking all this stuff into consideration.

&gt; Hi, Amy,
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, disclaimer: I am not an expert; this is stuff I've
&gt; learned from research, and I may get some bits wrong, though I'm sure
&gt; that I'm generally right--feel free to correct me, anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; Almost all women don't have enough testosterone to truly bulk up, 
so
&gt; you really shouldn't worry that you'll become mannishly muscle-bound.
&gt; Female bodybuilders work incredibly hard to get muscular, and they're
&gt; not lifting (relatively) dinky 12 lb shovel gloves. Shovel glove may
&gt; cause you to bulk up, but I'll tell you why that doesn't matter. At
&gt; first you may think you're bulking up, and you may be building muscle,
&gt; yes, but likely a lot of it is water and glycogen (?) at first, which
&gt; builds up quickly because your body isn't used to the exercise. When 
I
&gt; first started lifting, my body retained a whole bunch of fluid, which
&gt; was gone in a few weeks, so definitely don't let the initial weight
&gt; gain panic you into not exercising.
&gt; 
&gt; Look at yourself in the mirror naked. Do you see flab and pudge, or
&gt; visible, striated muscle? You should think of your body as visible 
fat
&gt; (the fat hiding your muscle tone) over muscle over...even more fat. 
A
&gt; lot of people don't think of the fat they have underneath their
&gt; muscles and even in between their muscles, but they should because
&gt; it's not muscle pushing their bellies out it's fat, or they'd be able
&gt; to see definition in their muscles and likely visible veins. Unless
&gt; you see defined muscle with the cuts between each muscle group, you
&gt; don't have to worry about having too much muscle. (Plus if you have 
a
&gt; hard time doing stuff like carrying groceries, then you don't have 
too
&gt; much muscle.) And if you're not doing any sort of weighted exercise,
&gt; then trust me, you don't have too much muscle.
&gt; 
&gt; That said, if you want to concentrate more on your weight and losing
&gt; fat, you should probably concentrate more on cardio, and only do
&gt; shovelglove (or whatever weighted exercise you choose) once a week 
so
&gt; you're not dieting away the muscle you do have. Apparently, once a
&gt; week is the magic maintenance number; if you let it go beyond a week,
&gt; you don't progress. If you want to gain more muscle, do work out the
&gt; same muscle group no more oftener than once every 48 hours--the muscle
&gt; needs time to recouperate and grow. Also, it seems it's easier to
&gt; either lose fat or build muscle, one at a time, which is why a lot 
of
&gt; weight lifters have a long bulking period with intense training then 
a
&gt; losing fat period with more concentrated cardio and maintenance
&gt; lifting. So don't worry if you go back and forth. Just make sure you
&gt; at least do some sort of weighted exercise once a week. Cardio, you
&gt; can do every day if you'd like. It's more a matter of ratio for
&gt; targetted goals than of doing or not doing. So if you see that you're
&gt; &quot;bulking up,&quot; don't panic and stop shovel gloving, just cut back 
to
&gt; once-a-week maintenance, and concentrate on cardio for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, don't worry about getting &quot;big&quot; through building 
muscle.
&gt; Try to lose the fat instead, because it's the muscle that's holding 
up
&gt; your skeleton, and it's muscle that burns calories just by being
&gt; there, and it's having muscle that raises your metabolism. (Male
&gt; professional body builders have to eat like 4,000 calories a day just
&gt; to maintain the big muscles they have, cuz muscle eats up protein 
like
&gt; crazy.) Fat mostly is there to store energy long term--very good in
&gt; case of famine, not so good in an industrialized society. You have 
to
&gt; exercise to stay thin into old age unless you want to eat less and
&gt; less as you get older while your muscle and bone waste away and your
&gt; metabolism slows down down down.
&gt; 
&gt; Check out this site: <a href="http://www.stumptuous.com/weights.html">http://www.stumptuous.com/weights.html</a> 
if you'd
&gt; like more info. I cribbed a whole bunch of info from her.
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; 
&gt; mayo :-)
