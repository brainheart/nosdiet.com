<pre>

While I don't in general recommend keeping track of
things (because it's boring, time consuming, and
unsustainable), I figure there are some doubting
Thomases and just plain confused folks out there who
have trouble imagining what a week of no-s diet meals
might look like. Also, Justin (in his last post)
persuaded me.

So here's what I ate last week. It's descriptive, not
prescriptive. It's not even particularly exemplary. I
don't, for example, recommend having just a peach and
nothing more for breakfast, and I don't often do that,
but I was in a hurry, and you know what, it happens. I
figured it was more useful to have a real week than an
ideal week. I tried to behave normally, and haven't
edited out my imperfections. Notice that while some
meals were larger or smaller (or stranger) than might
be desired, I never violated the letter of the law. I
never do, and this is key. Warning: if you're not a
doubting Thomas or hopelessly confused, this is going
to make very dull reading.

I've included caloric beverages in the list below. As
for non-caloric beverages, I usually drink a cup of
black coffee in the morning, and 2 cups of unsweetened
tea (1 green, 1 black) during the day. I also drink a
ton of water.

I've included S-days as well, so you can see how
crazy/sane they get after a year on the nosdiet.

Meals are numbered rather than named for visual impact
and brevity.

fried plantains with chipote ketchup, octopus salad,
