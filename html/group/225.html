Hi all! I am a 50 yr old lady, and I'm 5'2&quot; and weigh 143 lbs as of this 
morning. I've already lost around 10 lbs over the last several months mainly by 
trying to just stop snacking and staying away from sweets. I also have just started 
watching my food combining....not eating carbs together with proteins. I've started 
eating alot of fruit every day too, which seems to be making me feel more energetic. 
I haven't been getting too sleepy in the afternoons. 

My dad died of arterosclerosis and cardiac heart disease when he was 67 yrs. old. My 
mom has high blood pressure, my brother died last year of colon cancer, and three of 
my sisters (mom had eight kids) have had breast cancer. So....I think I need to do my 
best to get as healthy as I can while I'm still pretty young. Most people think I'm 
35 by my appearance, but I already have eight grandchildren. :) 

Anyway, I saw your webpage and decided to join and try out this eating plan as well 
in addition to my food combining and fruit eating. :) Worth a try, right? But I am 
sure I will have to be extra careful on the &quot;S&quot; days because I have a 
problem with trigger foods like pasta, bread, potatoes, and rice. Anyone else here a 
carb addict?

I went on the grapefruit diet, which is a high protein/low carb diet that you stay on 
for 12 days and then go off of it for two days. So every other weekend you can eat 
what you like. That was pretty good for me, and I lost around 20 lbs. That was 5 yrs 
ago, and I ended up over the years putting back on most of the weight. So I tried the 
diet again, but couldn't stick with it too well. So I'm food combining now, and 
feeling much healthier...no more digestive upsets.

Are you allowed to eat fruit on this diet on non-S days? I usually eat nothing but 
fruit till lunch time. Breakfast and mid-morning snack are fruits. And then I have 
another fruit for my afternoon snack.
