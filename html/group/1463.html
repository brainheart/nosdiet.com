By the way I have been meaning to ask -- What is a shovelglove? 
Who is this ranger you chat about? And Who is Reinhard - if he's 
not the guy behind the curtain? lol

Hey Annie, I have literally one minute, so heres the basics and I 
will respond more thoroughly after the holidays
1.Reinhard Engles is the founder and creator of the No S diet
see his recent post about &quot;Delayed hellos, congrats...etc..&quot;
and we all love him very much!
(ps, scroll back to my &quot;Attention ladies our founder be'eth a hunk&quot; 

post if you want to see his before and after picture
a sure fire inspiration, LOL) 
2. Take some time to peruse his whole website and you will find both 
www.shovelglove.com 
and www.urbanranger.com in &quot;link&quot; form.
3. Great to hear you are doing well, sorry about the news on eggplant
it is good, but not worth a flare up in your case :)
Love,
Deb






&gt; Woke up this morning feeling like the wicked witch of the east 
though! Wanted something sweet really, really bad to go with my 
coffee. Went down stairs and got on my Gazelle and excercised for 
20 minutes instead. Now I feel like Glenda the Good witch of the 
north -- lol. Wouldn't it be nice to live in fairyland where we 
could make all our dreams come true? NAH I'd probably take 
advantage and they'd strip me of any rights to have what ever I 
wanted. --hahaha! Well just to let you know my daughter won her 
volleyball game! YAY she was so excited and up beat. I wish I 
still had all that energy. I do love seeing her play it just 
reminds me of all the fun I had playing the sport. Had a great day 
yeaterday went to curves and got measured and weighed! I've lost 3 
lbs and 5 and 1/2 inches -- YAY me! Can't wait till the NoS helps 
make it more -- woohoo! Have a gr8t day all.

&gt; Hi land of OZ
&gt; &quot;Were off to see the Wizard&quot;
&gt; Here the Wizard of S is Reinhard, not the guy behind the curtain.
&gt; &quot;Step away from that curtain, pay no attention to that man!&quot;
&gt; I agree that is one of the best movies of all time
&gt; Annie, I actually wrote you like a 10KB letter the first night 
that 
&gt; I read your initial post... There must have been a problem 
&gt; submitting it and I was hopping mad when I realized it got lost 
and 
&gt; didn't show up the next day on the group site...I will try to 
&gt; recapture the thrust of it, though for me, once it leaves my 
&gt; fingers, travels through the computer, and out there, it is really 

&gt; out for good with my lousy short term memory LOL!
&gt; 
&gt; First, congratulations on joining us and of course I will pray for 

&gt; you, and all of us, to succeed...I can't imagine how those years 
&gt; with the RA had to be on you..I'm glad you took your willpower 
&gt; off &quot;the shelf&quot; as you put it...My brain is starting to melt down 

&gt; since it is mid afternoon here and that is usually when my mind is 

&gt; least potent...Siesta perhaps, nah just a little brain drain.
&gt; Stick with the No S lifestyle and even after that 1st week you 
will 
&gt; realize how much better you feel about eating for health and long 

&gt; term commitment to it...It is addictive in that you gain so much 
&gt; more than you give up, I hope you find it enjoyable...I wrote a 
post 
&gt; about two weeks ago and forgive me No S'sers but I will be 
redundant 
&gt; for our new friend
&gt; 
&gt; Paraphrased roughly from the editor of Prevention Magazine in a 
&gt; motivational lecture on weight loss, and maintainence.
&gt; 
&gt; When you have a Setback don't get upset...Instead
&gt; Welcome it, embrace it!
&gt; Only people going someplace have Setbacks
&gt; Successful people have setbacks
&gt; They are a sign you are on your way
&gt; to something better.
&gt; When you have a Setback (and we all have them)
&gt; Keep moving ahead and you will make it :)
&gt; 
&gt; I also remember you setting a goal of 2lbs a week...This is fine 
and 
&gt; good,but don't let the weeks of plateus or even maybe minor gains 

&gt; disappoint you so that you then fall into the all to familiar 
cycle 
&gt; of &quot;Kicking Thine Own Arse&quot; and getting disheartened..We are all 

&gt; cheering you on! Be patient with yourself and take each day, one 
at 
&gt; a time. Fake Hollandaise sounds pretty good...I never cared much 
&gt; for the real kind, too goopy :) And I love sauces and stuff that 
&gt; uses yogurt...I used to take Brown Cow or Stoneyfield Farm plain 
&gt; yogurt and mix dehydrated soup mix into it (hey that sounds like 
&gt; your idea) no wait, vegetable soup mix, and frozen spinach to make 

a 
&gt; really great dip.
&gt; 
&gt; Love
&gt; Debbie
&gt; PS...I heard that Eggplant triggers an inflammatory response and 
can 
&gt; worsen the symptoms of RA, so, incase your Rheumatologist hasn't 
&gt; already mentioned it, in addition to 3 No S's add No E (for 
&gt; eggplant) to your plan :)
