Welcome, Dawn.

If previous diet failures have you concerned about not
having the willpower to do no-s, keep these things in
mind:

1) You'll need about 3 weeks of hard core willpower;
after that habit starts to kick in. Unlike most other
diet plans, it's not a constant, eternal fight against
your nature. Your old habits, the stuff you are
unlearning, are weirder and less natural than the good
habits you are learning. So while the first few weeks
might be tough, don't despair, this level of toughness
is of limited duration. And consider how much better
it is to front load your efforts than have it get
harder and harder (the usual way diets work).

2) No S isn't just a necessary evil, a system that's
an unpleasant means to an end. You'll enjoy food more
than you did before. Since all of us presumably like
to eat or we wouldn't have gotten this way, I can't
think of a better incentive.

Anyway, make sure to bug us plenty as you build your
new habit.

&gt; Okay Everyone,
&gt; I have been silently reading all the E-mails
&gt; pretending I didn't really need
&gt; to do this...I guess now is as good a time as any to
&gt; introduce myself and
&gt; get on with doing this for real. My name is Dawn,
&gt; and I need to loose about
&gt; 30 lbs. I have done, Atkins, Southbeach,
&gt; WeightWatchers, and just about
&gt; every fad out there. I have taken about every diet
&gt; pill and personally love
&gt; anything with Ephedra,(energy) (I know it supposed
&gt; to be bad...I never
&gt; abused it though) For some of you 30 lbs may seem
&gt; like no big deal, but for
&gt; me it is...
&gt; I am in the National Guard (18 1/2 years) and my
&gt; weight makes me miss
&gt; promotions and gives me major stress. (nothing like
&gt; dropping your trousers
&gt; to have your hips and stomach measured to see if you
&gt; are in body fat range)
&gt; That being said, I still don't find the will power
&gt; to stay with anything
&gt; long enough to get the weight off. I like the sound
&gt; of this plan. I have
&gt; been trying to not do 2nds for a week and now I am
&gt; ready to do this for
&gt; real! This plan will not have me making a different
&gt; meal for my family and
&gt; a meal for me. I hated that and I was worried about
&gt; the messages it sent my
&gt; children, (mommy is fat, mommy doesn't like her
&gt; body, mommy is eating a
&gt; whole lb of bacon on her &quot;new&quot; diet and it is OK!?!)
&gt; I look forward to working with all of you! 
&gt; Encouraging all of you and
&gt; getting fit and trim with all of you! I think I
&gt; will even do something
&gt; active tomorrow!
&gt; Have a great no&quot;s&quot; day!

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear group, and especially Melanie,
&gt; I had fallen off the no S Diet, in favor of
&gt; the popular South Beach.
&gt; Now I have gained everything back, I shall give
&gt; myself a swift kick, and
&gt; even though it is an S Day, it is a good as any to
&gt; start. Like Melanie,
&gt; any
&gt; downward movement on the scale will be welcome,
&gt; and maybe slow but steady
&gt; is
&gt; much better than fast and yo yo!
