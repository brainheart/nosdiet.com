will be an S night for me, we are having our company christmas party 
at Outback and i am going to eateateat and enjoy every bite and some 
chocolate dessert. Our employees are venzuelan and mexican and they 
love this every year, they get dinner and gifts and there bonuses 
for christmas. We are so blessed to have good guys working for us.
I am sorry to hear about your Mom, I have a supportive Mom, it took 
10 years to get my MIL on my side.So I celebrate the breakthrough 
you had with her. WOO HOO. I know what it feels like. She may not 
even realize it, so i would maybe not even make mention of it to 
her.She may dash you down again,I say let sleeping dogs lie ! Enjoy 
your victory ! I read your post again just now and realize my MIL is 
often covertly sabbotaging our efforts to diet. Like sending the pie 
and cake home after Thanksgiving. Of which I have had neither of 
this week. Yeah for me ! :)but Neal has had plenty of. I will throw 
it away when I get home to celebrate !! crazy huh. But its got to 
taste old by now:)Well its coffee time for me. love to all, happy 
sssin weekend, Jools
&gt; 

&gt; chocolate &quot;Mouse&quot; which had chocolate dipped frosting over a cake 


&gt; felt like a major victory in gaining her respect for 
&gt; my personal choice :)
&gt; know they are rooting you on :)

&gt; (and I ate the mouses neck! :) Shame on you!poor mousey, we used 
to catch mice when i was about 15-16(we were of course high on acid 
or something so it was quite funny to us. At least I think they were 
mice,maybe it was hallucinations hell i dont really know now, LOL. 
Jeez was that ever a trip down memory lane. lololol
