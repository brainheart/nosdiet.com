Thom..

I would love a partner in crime:)

We also have Gastric bypass in common. I had mine 2.5 years ago!

I think I read Ginny also had one.

My goal now is to live like every other normal weight person. 
I think this way of life.. I'm not going to say DIET anymore, is really going 

to work. The only change I see that I need to add is I'm going to have 6 

meals. Three normal for me meals and I'm going to add a protein bar at 2:00p.m. 

and If I feel I need it one in the evening after my dinner. The to small 

meals are only if I'm starving and blood sugar is low. That way I'm not freaking 

out. If anyone knows why I should not do this please let me know.

O.k. I think I might have messed up today. I don't feel like I did but a 

friend brought it to my attention. I was sharing the way of life (diet) with a 

friend over dinner and I had just order wine. And my friend said what about 

that, it has sugar.
But I do remember reading that it was o. k to have one or two a day. I may 

have that once a week. Is this O.K. or should I save it for S days? What does 

everyone do for alcoholic beverages?

I still feel really good about today.. Day 2.. and guess what everyone! I 

lost a pound. I'm sure this is water weight but what the heck. I am drinking 

more water. I find myself reaching for the water when it is close to a meal 

and I'm alittle hungry. This is a big plus.

Thanks for listening!
Shannon
