Congratulations on your progress Ajay. I really enjoy reading 
stories from all of you who has made progress. I am currently into 
my third day and I feel great. I have not started my cardio yet. I 
will start walking tonight. I am so excited about about this 
program. I feel as though I am in control. I cannot say that about 
any of the diets out there. Well good luck to you Ajay and welcome.

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently lost 30 lbs and maintaining and to tell the truth that 

is 
&gt; the most greatest feeling. I have still another 20 or so pounds 
to 
&gt; go to get into ideal shape. (I was 200 max, now 170, wannabe 150, 

&gt; reasonable cos I am only 5'3&quot; tall) To get down 30 lbs in 3 
months 
&gt; was sweaty business. It was a combination of diet and exercise 
and 
&gt; good eating habits. I used to get up at 5 am to make it to the 
&gt; National Park or game reserve so close to my place. I live in 
&gt; Bombay, India, which is a mad city with a dearth of space, so 
there 
&gt; is no space to run on the roads without being chased and bitten by 

&gt; stray dogs.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been fat since I was 15, now i am 25, and spent a great 
deal 
&gt; of my time alone. I had and still have very few friends, no girl 
&gt; friends, which I attribute to my weight. I really maxed out 
thanks 
&gt; to the generous portions of rice at home as well as binging after 

&gt; drinks and chinese food, lot of it. I have curbed the binging now 

&gt; and dont have more than 2 pegs of hard liqour or 90 ml of alcohol, 

&gt; moderation is the key. NO more red oily rice passed off 
as &quot;chinese 
&gt; food&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; The thing that blew my lid was when a group of carolers came to my 

&gt; place and a young girl refused to shake my hand. I then enroled 
in 
&gt; a gymnasium, but couldnt do weight as they would only result in 
more 
&gt; stretch marks. So i had to take the cardiovascular route. I was 
in 
&gt; search of new places when I stumbled upon literally joggers 
&gt; paradise, so close to home.
&gt; 
&gt; In India, obesity is not that a problem, but as we are getting 
&gt; more &quot;westernized&quot; and &quot;materialistic&quot; or &quot;urbanized&quot; 
it is 
starting 
&gt; to become a problem. Ok a new McDonalds has just opened near my 
&gt; place, I havent gone there yet, and I probably will not go. Feel 
&gt; like bringing the place down with a bazooka but it comes down to 
&gt; self control.
&gt; 
&gt; I have put off my jogging and walking for the rainy season 
(monsoon) 
&gt; but planning to start it again in Sept-Oct and become a lean mean 

&gt; guy by this Christmas.
&gt; 
&gt; So help me Ajay.
&gt; 
&gt; Ajay Lewis.
