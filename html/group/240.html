Oh well, worth a shot. It sounds like you've got a
good grip on the issues.

Now that you've had to endure this city slicker's
ignorant, overbearing advice on your household
management, how about a dose of naive envy: 85 miles
from the nearest grocery store but with an internet
connection, I'm impressed!

&gt; &gt; while it was alive. If so, you might want to think
&gt; &gt; about how to deal with this &quot;production issue.&quot;
&gt; It's
&gt; &gt; definitely easier to resist the call of the fridge
&gt; if
&gt; &gt; there isn't a whole lot in it.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I can see what you are saying, but it doens't
&gt; really work that
&gt; way....when we butcher a pig let's say, that pig has
&gt; to last until the next
&gt; year's pig is ready to butcher. Likewise, we can
&gt; only hunt every
&gt; fall....that meat is all processed and put in the
&gt; freezer, canned, or what
&gt; have you. The way it kind of goes is that we end up
&gt; eating a lot of poultry
&gt; and rabbit in the summer, because nothing else is
&gt; ready to put up yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I only grocery shop every 6 weeks or so (the grocery
&gt; store is 85 miles one
&gt; way) I probably have less in my fridge than a lot
&gt; of city folks do.
&gt; Actually, milk and eggs are the major things in my
&gt; fridge :) But, I have 3
&gt; freezers, shelves of canned food, and jars full of
&gt; dehydrated stuff. I cook
&gt; every meal &quot;from scratch&quot; as it is.
&gt; 
&gt; My downfall seems to be my own baking I'm afraid. 
&gt; Just grazing all day.
&gt; (moo) And junk food that my hubby likes to pick up
&gt; when he is driving truck
&gt; and stops somewhere. And eating more than I should
&gt; at the dinner
&gt; table....big problem. I did the water trick and
&gt; only having one plate last
&gt; night, and survived :) It's a step!
