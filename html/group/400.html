Hi no1space,

Time for another self-quote:

from: 

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#fat">http://www.nosdiet.com/#fat</a>

**********************************************

Aren't you worried about fat?

I don't want to seem like I'm coming down as &quot;pro-fat&quot;
in the carbs vs. fat debate. I think the evidence
strongly suggests that too much fat is bad for you.
But I also think that much (if not most) of the fat
people consume is in the form of snack foods (chips,
crisps, popcorn, etc.) and sweets (candy bars, ice
cream, pop tarts, Capt'n Crunch, cake, etc.), which
are restricted by the noSdiet (these also tend to be
the worst kinds of fat). So while the nosdiet does not
address fat explicitly, it does so as a kind of side
effect.

The reason I don't address it explicitly, besides the
fact that the side effect restriction seems just fine
to me, is that it's a more complex issue than sugar.
There are good fats and bad fats, and it's often less
clear which foods are high in fat whereas sugar tends
to jump right out at you. Simplicity and clarity are
important. If you have a complicated diet that is 100%
in sync with the latest nutritional research and
covers every theoretical base, it won't do you any
good if you can't stick with it (never mind that the
latest nutritional research is a rapidly moving
target). Zero percent of a hundred is zero. An eighty
percent solution that you can actually stick with is
infinitely preferable to that.

*************************************************

In other words, don't worry about it unless you think
it's becoming a big issue for you, which I think is
unlikely. It just isn't, in comparison with the basic
rules, an economical use of your limited &quot;worry&quot;
resources. The foods you mention are fatty, and
probably &quot;bad&quot; fat, but I don't think that most people
get most of their fat from such &quot;mealy&quot; sources: I
think it's more (or at least enough to make a decisive
difference) from snacky sources. Also, I find that
having just 3 meals a day means one starts taking
better care of what they consist of without the burden
of additional rules. So while I do eat all of the
foods you mention without worrying about it, I usually
eat something at least a tad healthier, because I
don't want to blow my only &quot;shots.&quot;

&gt; technically, (and for good measure, in practical
&gt; terms), where do 
&gt; common &quot;fattening&quot; foods fit into the nosdiet? I am
&gt; referring to 
&gt; foods like cheese pizza, fried chicken, other fried
&gt; foods, italian 
&gt; foods with heavy cream sauce, etc.
