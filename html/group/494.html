Hi Rose,

This may sound crazy, I think the easiest thing is
just absolutely decide not to do it -- ever. If you
give yourself any wiggle room with these work parties,
you're bound to seriously slip up. Hard as this
sounds, it really is easier than trying to navigate
&quot;just a little every now and then.&quot; There is no
decision to be made, no agonizing, you know you just
can't. Get a cup of coffee or tea to show you're a
sport and just act like you're full. 

See:

<a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/#fence">http://www.nosdiet.com/#fence</a>

For more on why strictness actually makes it easier. 

Hope this helps,

Reinhard

&gt; Hello Max;
&gt; 
&gt; You wrote:
&gt; &gt; I eat so early in the morning then I have class
&gt; then Im hungry . . 
&gt; . Do you think eating pretzels or animal crackers
&gt; that are both low 
&gt; in fat would be ok.
&gt; 
&gt; My thoughts:
&gt; No. I suggest eating a bigger breakfast, one that
&gt; fills you. I think 
&gt; I see a clue in your question whether animal
&gt; crackers low in fat 
&gt; would be ok. Don't avoid good fat. It will fill you
&gt; and keep you 
&gt; satiated for a long time. Avoid bad fat. Whatever
&gt; people think, or 
&gt; are annoyed by, the lowcarb hysteria, it did bring
&gt; out the opposite 
&gt; danger of extreme hicarb/low fat eating. I am
&gt; guessing the nosdiet 
&gt; high council :-) would suggest a good, balanced
&gt; breakfast, and I am 
&gt; adding to not skimp on the good fat. It will fight
&gt; the returning 
&gt; hunger longer than anything. I've read that some,
&gt; including our 
&gt; fearless leader m(_ _)m, eat oatmeal. That can fill
&gt; you up, and, 
&gt; besides other good properties, has a good glycemic
&gt; value, which makes 
&gt; it a better carb. If it doesn't fill you up, add
&gt; some butter (good 
&gt; fat). That oughta gag, I mean fill you for a week,
&gt; or at least till 
&gt; dinner.
&gt; 
&gt; Pretzels and animal crackers are white processed
&gt; flour with white 
&gt; processed sugar - very bad.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; Tom
&gt; 
&gt;
