Well, friends, I finally have some personal good news. I started NoS fresh at the 
beginning of October, and re-experienced the good &quot;free-ing&quot; aspects as 
well as the difficulties of changing habits. As usual, the first strictness tended to 
relax, and two weeks of houseguests gave opportunities for making exceptions. But 
very often, your emails encouraged me not to fall totally off the wagon. (I've been 
wondering, how did anyone diet in the days before email groups?!!!)

When one month had passed and it was time to get on the scale, I realized that my 
period was going to mess things up--it can add 5-6-7 pounds of water retention. So I 
didn't believe that first number...and tried again when it was all over. I am very 
happy to report an apparent 2 pound loss! The number on the scale had not gone down 
for many months (years?), so I am inclined to believe it, especially because I've 
been feeling my clothes are looser. Two pounds wouldn't have excited me in the old 
days, when dieting and weight loss was easier and quicker, but now I will be happy 
for any OUNCE that goes away and stays away. =)

So I am happy, I am re-committed, and I am looking forward to next month. I'm even 
trying to figure out how to get some exercise into my schedule. I guess it's time to 
go buy a sledgehammer--LOL--I never thought *I* would be in the market for one of 
those!

Keep it up, all of you! There's one more bit of evidence that it will work.

Diane
