Hi Lissa-
2 lbs. is a great start!! I'm hoping to lose about the same as you are by the end of 
the year. I found that if I do a small amount of exercise each morning before work, 
it helps alot. I do about 75 crunchs on an exercise ball and you wouldn't believe how 
much that seems to help my stomach!! In just a few days, you start to feel good about 
yourself, it's a great confidence booster!! Good luck to you.

Hi Amy,



42lbs. in 5 months is awesome! 



I just started my 1st day yesterday. It was tough to not snack, but I made
it through. The scale registered a 2lb. loss this morning. I'm hoping to
lose about 30 by the end of the year. 



Good Luck to You,

~Lissa







hi, this is my first day. I have followed a similar diet two years 
ago and lost 42lbs. in approximately 5 months. it was wonderful, so 
now I'm at it again. I have alot of clothes I would love to fit into 
again!! Thanks for all the tips.
Amy
