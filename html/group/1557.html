I am NO-S-ING successfully and not MAKING my husband join in, but he is
losing a bit as a spin off.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if many people are successfully harassed
&gt; into dieting... If your husband *wants* to lose
&gt; weight, then he's going to have to do something, and
&gt; you can do (and have done) him a service by making him
&gt; aware of no-s. As you point out, it does have the
&gt; great selling point of not absolutely prohibiting his
&gt; pop and popcorn, and its humor, simplicity, and
&gt; no-price will make him feel like less of a mark. But
&gt; if he doesn't really care about losing weight, then we
&gt; have a pre-nos problem, and I'm not sure how to (or
&gt; whether one should) talk someone into that. Set a good
&gt; example, let him know you're concerned, and that
&gt; you're ready to talk whenever he gets interested. I
&gt; wish you could do more, but if he doesn' t feel like
&gt; it's his own thing, his own initiative, there's no way
&gt; he's going to succeed. It's hard enough when it is.
&gt;
&gt; Hope something clicks with him,
&gt;
&gt; Reinhard
