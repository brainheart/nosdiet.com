&gt; Great Deb. Even with your holiday eating. I am jealous. I could 
be doing better Keep it up.
....Thank you very much *Lee* :)
Well to be completely honest it was a big surprise for me :)
It seems that the small changes overall, to my way of eating, on a 
day to day basis are having the most impact here....even with 
sebacks and bad weeks, the drastic reduction in portion sizes and in 
between snacking, I think, are whats really helping... Our dessert 
consumption is probably down more than 50% from what it used to be, 
maybe even more....
So don't be jealous... You are doing great too, since you are still 
trying...Just don't give up and eventually you will make one little 
triumph after another, and before you know what's happening, you 
will be where you want to be :) I wish you well, and try to keep 
your eyes on the forest, not the trees....just notice the trees but 
don't focus on them....Know what I mean Vern?
Once Winter is over my sugar consumption will be alot less, because 
I really enjoy hot cocoa at this time of year and usually have a cup 
every day (an unofficial S). This will change by the time it warms 
up again (pleeeeaaaase soooon!)
I have a rotten stinkin cold right now and sound very stuffed up in 
da dose :)
Love,
Deb
