Alex,
noS. Isn't it great, why didn't we have that flash of brilliance?
At least we recognized it when we read it! I don't know if this will be
inspirational, but it is what my experiences have been. It has been 5
weeks, I've lost 6 pounds, this is just the way I want it. I've lost
faster, but have always gained back. I want my way of eating to change.

My aunt and uncle are &quot;naturally thin&quot;, but when their way of 
eating
is examined, they are noSers unaware. They eat a full-ish plate and
seldom have seconds. The meal is balanced, they aren't afraid to have
desert, but only occasionally serve it. You seldom (next to never) see
candy in their home if it isn't Christmas. When they go out to eat they
almost always take some home because they quit eating when they are
full. 
Some people can do this without to much hassle, me, I need some
rules to follow, to build a habit. Thank you Reinhard.
My worst evenings are when I haven't eaten enough for breakfast
and/or lunch. Eating noSeconds makes me very unsatisfied about 60-90
minutes after dinner if I've gone light on the earlier meal(s). If all
3 meals are reasonable, evenings aren't bad. Today is one of my short
meal days, to add insult to injury my wife brought Krispy Kreams home.
I'll just hang in for another hour and I'll be in bed.
Eat, this isn't about not eating, it is about eating reasonably.
Eat when you should, it will be easier not to eat when you shouldn't.
My progress the last 5 weeks:
Start 249
Wk 1 248
Wk 2 247
Wk 3 246

Wk 4 244
Wk 5 243 
The goal ?? Whatever I get down to, for me it isn't the destination, it
is the new road I'm traveling.

Hi fellow NoSers...
I came across the nosdiet.com link on mothering.com and after reading
through the website I was just really excited about the common sense
behind this approach. I'm currently about 20 lbs. above what I'd like to
weigh. I'm not super overweight (per weight-watchers at the upper limit
of what I'm supposed to weigh at my height 5f7inches), but I know that
it would be much better for my health if I could lose some of the extra
pounds. I eat pretty healthy, generally, but my biggest problem used to
be the snacking :) I also tend to eat for all the wrong reasons
(social, boredom etc.). That's why this lifestyle change makes a lot of
sense to me. I had my first day &quot;on it&quot; yesterday...and did not 
snack,
but had a hot 1% milk chocolate after my no-seconds dinner. Today was
good so far and I intend to stick to the plan. 

Well...that's pretty much it for now, I guess.

Hope to read some more inspirational stories from all of you soon.

Alex

PS: Gibt's hier in der Gruppe Leute aus Deutschland ????
