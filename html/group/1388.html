&gt; I am diabetic and monitor my blood sugar before going to bed and 
on getting
&gt; up.I do have some natural insulin left and raw veggies aren't 
hurting the
&gt; levels.I'm running tight as I've got some eye problems which I 
don't want to
&gt; get worse.

Dearest Hana, 
Diabetes is now considered to be an official epidemic in the US, 
sorry you have to go through that..I had Gestational Diabetes when I 
was pregnant and that was probably one of the most difficult 
experiences I have ever had..I have ENOUGH mood swings without my 
sugar levels making things worse...I was a raving be'otch if I 
needed something to eat and even put it off for only say an hour or 
so..Then I'd have something and I felt like an entirely different 
person.
It came from being so overweight but then, after consulting with the 
hospital nutritionist and they told me simply to, drum rolll.....

Tada!
CUT OUT SUGAR (no S, no S, no S they chanted in unison!)
After that change I was cool! Didn't need insulin, just a healthy 
way of eating.
Hopefully your weight loss will help with the Diabetes...Unless you 
have juvenille type, sometimes weight loss can completely reverse 
the disease...I'm scared because, they told me that if I gained my 
weight back (which I did this year) I might become diabetic again, 
so Thank God for No S and all of your great support! It's a terrible 
condition to live with.

By the way, back to my pet topic, the acupuncture approach, the eye 
is the external sense organ which is the manifestation of Liver 
Chi...People with any Blood issues usually have liver issues. Don't 
worry though, it is a very common thing..The liver does so much all 
the time, it is really easy for it to get overwhelmed. So do 
whatever you can to make life easier on your liver, maybe that will 
help your eyes? The Liver is the &quot;Master Planner&quot; in traditional 

Chinese medicine (TCM) and even planning too much can cause this 
imbalance. In addition, Anger is the emotion associated with the 
Liver..excess anger, whether expressed or suppressed will harm the 
Liver Chi. So much of this is hereditary.
I am virtually blind without my contacts. 
I have heard that the herbal suppliment Milk Thistle supposedly 
helps the Liver. The job of the Liver in Western understanding is to 
Store and Detoxify the Blood.. In Eastern translation this means it 
is in charge of regulating the &quot;Smooth Flow of Chi&quot; Chi being our 

energy. When things aren't running smoothly, due to emotional or 
physical ups and downs, it can have an adverse effect on liver chi, 
and conversely when the liver chi is deficient, things don't &quot;run 

smoothly&quot; All Eastern approaches are what I like to term &quot;Chicken 

and Egg&quot; relationships, very hard to tell what came first.
Diabetics blood sugar fluctuations is a form of this uneven flow of 
Chi.
I love Traditional Chinese Medicine..To me it is fascinating to see 
how everything functions and manifests. Hope I'm not boring you 
guys :)
Again, Kudos for your veggie snacking, I'm sure it's doing you no 
harm and you are well in control of your insulin checkins
God Bless
Debbie
