Hi Folks,

I recently lost 30 lbs and maintaining and to tell the truth that is 
the most greatest feeling. I have still another 20 or so pounds to 
go to get into ideal shape. (I was 200 max, now 170, wannabe 150, 
reasonable cos I am only 5'3&quot; tall) To get down 30 lbs in 3 months 

was sweaty business. It was a combination of diet and exercise and 
good eating habits. I used to get up at 5 am to make it to the 
National Park or game reserve so close to my place. I live in 
Bombay, India, which is a mad city with a dearth of space, so there 
is no space to run on the roads without being chased and bitten by 
stray dogs.

I have been fat since I was 15, now i am 25, and spent a great deal 
of my time alone. I had and still have very few friends, no girl 
friends, which I attribute to my weight. I really maxed out thanks 
to the generous portions of rice at home as well as binging after 
drinks and chinese food, lot of it. I have curbed the binging now 
and dont have more than 2 pegs of hard liqour or 90 ml of alcohol, 
moderation is the key. NO more red oily rice passed off as &quot;chinese 

food&quot;.

The thing that blew my lid was when a group of carolers came to my 
place and a young girl refused to shake my hand. I then enroled in 
a gymnasium, but couldnt do weight as they would only result in more 
stretch marks. So i had to take the cardiovascular route. I was in 
search of new places when I stumbled upon literally joggers 
paradise, so close to home.

In India, obesity is not that a problem, but as we are getting 
more &quot;westernized&quot; and &quot;materialistic&quot; or &quot;urbanized&quot; 
it is starting 
to become a problem. Ok a new McDonalds has just opened near my 
place, I havent gone there yet, and I probably will not go. Feel 
like bringing the place down with a bazooka but it comes down to 
self control.

I have put off my jogging and walking for the rainy season (monsoon) 
but planning to start it again in Sept-Oct and become a lean mean 
guy by this Christmas.

So help me Ajay.

Ajay Lewis.
