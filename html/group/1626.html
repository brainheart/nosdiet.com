perfect day 
&gt; for me..i have eaten some sugar and i am really fighting the urge 

to say @!$% it ! and cozy up in front of the tv with a bag of salt &amp; 

vinegar chips...i just keep telling myself not to make a minor 
indescretion a full fledged binge. how do you guys deal with 
insanely stong cravings to eat?
thanks again ! donna o&quot;

Firstly Donna, congratulations for trying to be honest with 
yourself. We will certainly be here for you if you feel the urge to 
keep yourself more on track with public admissions to *keep* you 
away from denial...Diet confessional? Help me Father, I have 
snacked.. :)
Secondly don't set your standards to &quot;perfection&quot; it doesn't exist 

and all you will do is focus on the negative....Try to keep 
your &quot;blinders&quot; on, so to speak, to the little indiscretions or 

bumps on the road...That's not to say, don't acknowledge you had 
one, but just don't make it be the factor that then (through guilty 
feelings) makes you throw in the towel and say &quot;F*@k&quot; it...
If you are really really craving something, try to buy a smaller 
portion with a &quot;negative feedback&quot; outcome of being empty before you 

actually get to &quot;full fledged binge status&quot;...Also, no where in No S 

diet does it say you can't have these foods...Take a couple of 
handfuls and add them to your meal...Eat each chip like it is the 
best thing and you want to make the taste really hit your senses (as 
opposed to wolfing down the whole bag)
Now don't get me wrong...I have plenty of &quot;indiscretions&quot; and I am 

sure that other people here, including the founder, would agree that 
this does happen...Just break out of that &quot;false&quot; idea that 
perfection exists when battling any challenge, whether diet or any 
part of life...You can't say &quot;F*#k&quot; it though, just say &quot;Oops I 

guess I had a little snack&quot; and don't make yourself out to be a 
failure...The last thought I have is try to keep tv minimized 
because there is an almost inextricable link to &quot;noshing and 
snacking&quot; once that boob tube goes on...If you must, try to replace 

chips and other &quot;stuff it in your face mindlessly&quot; types of foods 

with maybe, a cup of hot cocoa or some cup of soup? Just take it one 
day at a time and recognize whatever traps are all around you, then 
tackle them one at a time....
Good Luck!
Debbie
