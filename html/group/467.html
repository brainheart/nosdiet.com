Sadly, I understand Maurice's predicament... and I
imagine there are at least a couple other natural born
ice cream inhalers in this group...

You're right, Alex, that ultimately it comes down to
common sense and self control. But nowadays these
faculties are generally in worse shape than even our
flabby guts. We've got to start with slow and easy
exercises, until the will is strong enough to walk on
its own. I'm optimistic that with a few pointers we
can get Maurice the additional structure he needs to
make it past these weekends. After all, it sounds like
he's doing pretty well during the week. We've got
something to work with.

Maurice, here are some practical pointers that occur
to me:

1) be stricter about the snacks during the week. Might
not seem like much, but it adds up, and it's training
for the weekend. I do believe that these 5/7 habits
get internalized and carry over to the other 2/7 -- at
least, I know it was the case with me.

2) how about going to an ice cream parlor for a cone
rather than buying a pint or gallon? That way there's
only so much to inhale. Same idea for the other stuff:
get the smallest size possible. I find this is easier
to get away with when the treat is really top quality.
Don't let the movie folks fool you: blowing twice as
much for half as much really is a good investment.

3) Buy a big batch of fruit Friday night and keep it
unrefrigerated in a conspicuous place so you are
conscience bound to eat it. If you find fruit
uninspiring, experiment a little. Get that crazy
mexican papaya you don't know what to do with. With a
little googling you'll figure it out. Make it feel
like a luxury, exotic, exciting and you're appetite
will feel sufficiently flattered to forgo other stuff.
Fruit is big. It takes up space. It's like nature's
stomach stapler. 

4) Time is on your side. It's nice to see results
after a month, but it can take longer. You're in much
better shape that someone who's been flip-flopping.
You have a foundation of self discipline on which to
build.

People in this group have had success with reduced
s-day nosdiet, but I'm hesitant to recommend it
because I think the people who find it most tempting
are least likely to be able to stick with it... also,
that's not what I do myself, which doesn't mean it
can't work, just that I'm not in a position to talk
about it.

&gt; ice cream. Are you mad
&gt; or what?
&gt; 
&gt; Surely the treat bit at weekends is simply a treat,
&gt; nothing more - it
&gt; doesn't mean you eat all you would have done during
&gt; the week to catch up.
&gt; You need a bit of common sense. Don't say you need
&gt; more guidance - take
&gt; responsibility for yourself, it's your life after
&gt; all.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I'm not exactly a newbie anymore, but I have
&gt; the SAME EXACT 
&gt; PROBLEM on the weekends.... I do &quot;pretty&quot; well on
&gt; the weekdays. I 
&gt; never have full-blown snacks, but I may have a
&gt; &quot;bite&quot; of something 
&gt; between meals to get me to the next meal if it is a
&gt; few hours away. 
&gt; But come the weekend, it's like the rules disappear
&gt; altogether. I'll 
&gt; eat till I'm full at meals, eat snacks anytime I
&gt; want, and then I'll 
&gt; go and buy myself a treat or two, like ice cream,
&gt; cookies, or candy 
&gt; bars. The problem is, I &quot;inhale&quot; the treat, whatever
&gt; it is. If it's 
&gt; cookies, I'll eat half the package, If ice cream, I
&gt; eat the whole 
&gt; package if it's a pint, or 1/3 to 1/2 the package if
&gt; a half-gallon. 
&gt; Then, of course, I'll come back to it later or next
&gt; day so it's all 
&gt; gone by the end of the weekend. I know this follows
&gt; the letter of the 
&gt; nosdiet rules, but I just *know* that I must be
&gt; undoing any good that 
&gt; I achieve during the week. And I walk almost every
&gt; day (usually 3 
&gt; miles), and do shovelglove 5x a week. But I have not
&gt; really lost any 
&gt; net pounds after about a month.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a feeling that the relaxed rules for the
&gt; weekends is too 
&gt; liberal for me and my personality. But if I make it
&gt; too strict, human 
&gt; nature will make me rebel and resent it. So what can
&gt; I do to add more 
&gt; discipline to my s-days?

&gt; &gt; Howdy!! Just posting to say how excited I am to
&gt; actually find a 
&gt; &gt; group that fits my &quot;live-it&quot; style..hehe I keep
&gt; telling myself it's 
&gt; &gt; not a diet..it's a &quot;live-it&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am a Stay at Home mom of four children, ages 12,
&gt; 11, 6 and 9 
&gt; months.
&gt; &gt; I have lived by the &quot;No Ss&quot; rule for a month or so
&gt; now and lost 
&gt; seven 
&gt; &gt; pounds. Now recently I find myself sliiiiding
&gt; back into bad 
&gt; habits. 
&gt; &gt; While it's true I don't eat &quot;garbage foods&quot; on the
&gt; weekdays, I seem 
&gt; &gt; to make up for it on the weekends. Why is this? 
&gt; and I'm not even 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; fan of sweets, just during one week a month it
&gt; seems. And 
&gt; snacking. 
&gt; &gt; Again, when no one is home I do soooo well, eat
&gt; all my veggies and 
&gt; &gt; drink TONS of water, but on the weekends it seems
&gt; harder.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, I pose this question....if I'm doing so well
&gt; on the weekdays, 
&gt; am 
&gt; &gt; I just undoing it on the weekends?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks in Advance...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Pal....pondering all the new and wonderful friends
&gt; I'm gonna make 
&gt; &gt; here.
