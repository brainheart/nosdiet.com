Hi Guys! Hope you all had good ones today :)
I wrote Reinhard the other day because, heh heh, I was in need of an 
extra pep talk and was too wimpy to complain to all you guys.. 
Needless to say, he is the top of the crop! The finest founder in 
the foundation, and gave this girl a little extra fat to chew 
regarding tweaking NoS so it kicks in... Thanks for listening 
Reinhard... I doubt that Atkins would ever get involved one on one 
with his following :) Everyone let's hear it,,,
Reinhard you are our hero, and we love you!!!!
You really deserve the honor of being called 
&quot;Guru&quot;...You are a most excellent person :)
So, I didn't want to mention weight loss for some reason here, 
because I guess I was worried that it only came from the fact that I 
have been sick for almost 3 weeks...And I was just overwhelmed with 
crappy feelings in general. I was thinking maybe it wouldn't really 
count and maybe it would just come flying back on me once I started 
eating normally again... Well it hasn't and I'm back to three meals 
a day... So I have lost another 3 pounds guys!!! And that was after 
about an 8 week plateau (the thing that was nagging at me)
Well, whatever. Sickness or not, it counts! I believe that makes it 
about 7 lbs since the beginning of the year!!!
I didn't drink any coffee for those weeks. And I normally had two or 
three cups, with sugar, before the virus. That's a habit which I 
thought for sure, would never change, but now I think I may try to 
keep coffee to only one cup a day (mmmm my brain is already 
revolting against this! LOL)
I intend to eat a lovely portion of Haagen Daaz Chocolate Chocolate 
Chip ice cream tomorrow to celebrate this extra loss!!!!
Paradoxical eh? I'm not gonna gain any of those pounds back.. I'm 
not worried, because at this point, even desserts are more enjoyable 
in moderation, and how can one dessert a week do someone in?
Tell me! Come on, tell me! LOL...
So what are you all going to dig into this weekend? I hope it's 
real yummy!
Love,
Deb
