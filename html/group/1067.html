Thank you Sunshine and Kim. I am hoping today will be a little better than yesterday. 
I didn't do too badly - just one little slip. Habits are hard to break - but I 
started to eat something and then thought -- hey I shouldn't be eating this - so I 
threw it out. 
Chel
ps -- I used to know someone by your name (same first and last) but I cant remember 
where from (maybe even highschool... so long ago) what area are you from? 



-------------- Original message -------------- 

&gt; Welcome to the group, Chel. I&quot;m new too. I will be starting tomorrow (was 

&gt; going to start today, but had another family gathering today!!). 
&gt; 
&gt; I, too, think a list of unsure foods would be great.

&gt; Chel,

&gt; Welcome to the group! The thing that helps me with doing NoS is 
&gt; knowing that it works--I've tried it successfully and still use it. 

&gt; 
&gt; Anytime I am tempted during the week, I just remind myself that the 

&gt; weekend is almost here and I can have dessert or a snack. That helps 

&gt; to keep me on track. 
&gt; 
&gt; As far as that granola bar, I'm not so sure that it is an &quot;S&quot; food. 

&gt; I have a post from a few days ago that hopefully someone will answer 

&gt; questioning the &quot;S&quot; category of certain foods. Unless the chocolate 

&gt; chips were the primary ingredient in the granola bar, I think that it 

&gt; would have been okay. But until I get my other post answered I can't 

&gt; say for sure.

&gt; &gt; Hi... my name is Chel and I'm a new no-s'er! My friend Mary (Hi 

&gt; Mary!) passed on a link to the site -- which I loved -- so we both 

&gt; started today. I've done weight watchers (lost 90+ pounds -- 70 of 

&gt; it I found again) and Atkins, and most other diets under the sun. I 

&gt; think I will like this one... no counting carbs, points, fat grams, 

&gt; calories etc. Seems simple and realistic. I did decide to give away 

&gt; the granola bar I brought for lunch though, even though it is low fat 

&gt; it had chocolate chips in it, so I decided it was S. 
&gt; &gt; For those of you who have been doing this for a while -- any advice 

&gt; is welcome!
