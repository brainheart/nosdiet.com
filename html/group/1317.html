dear deb

once again, you have gone to the heart of the matter

It takes a Herculean effort to keep your mind positive, but that will
make the difference. Most people gain weight when they are sad,
lonely or stressed...

or living out of the past, trapped by it.

positive, loving thoughts are essential. I have found Louise Hay's book 
you
can heal your life, and her meditations to heal your life fantastic. I 
give
myself doses of them every day.

here is one about guilt - her meditations/thoughts on a topic start and 
end
with an affirmation.

I value my freedom, so I neither give nor receive guilt.

As I child, I was manipulated through guilt into good behaviour: &quot;Don't 
be
like that. Don't say that. No, no, no!&quot; Religion also uses guilt to 
keep
people in line, even telling them that they will burn in hell if they
&quot;misbehave&quot;. I forgive the churches and church authorities. I choose 
to
forgive my parents and to forgive myself. Many of us have been living under
a heavy mantle of guilt, felling &quot;not good enough&quot; for whatever reason. 
This
is a new day. I take back my power! I start by loving and accepting myself
unconditionally.

I love and accept myself exactly as I am.

love from jen

Hi Lee, it's Debbie here...I think that you could tweak the system if
you call the hurricaine a &quot;Storm&quot; that starts with S!
Don't focus on the mistakes you make in the process. As I said to
someone a few days ago:
Setbacks are for people who are going somewhere..if you weren't on
the road to a successful life, you would never even think of yourself
as &quot;falling off&quot; the path to begin with, because you wouldn't have 
a
goal in mind...Keep your eyes on the prize
Welcome that setback and embrace it!
It means that you are going somewhere, not just settling to stay the
same. It is not easy, I know that very well..I don't know how
overweight you are, or what your background is, but we are all in
this group for similar reasons..Incase you were wondering. I am 210
lbs now (after my first loss of 5!) so I can relate to wanting to get
thinner. And guess what, 3 years ago I was around 165. I didn't
maintain the loss, because I didn't adopt a lifestyle change and when
the stress hit me big time this winter, I got really depressed sat on
my buns, and ate non-stop...I feel so much more in control just
having to make some small modifications to my eating and thinking
with Reinhards great suggestions, and I really feel that I will be
able to keep this going for life because it is just about not
overeating and I can still enjoy those high calorie foods once or
twice a week.
It takes a Herculean effort to keep your mind positive, but that will
make the difference. Most people gain weight when they are sad,
lonely or stressed...
Be a friend to yourself and congratulate yourself for every small
achievement...Including the setbacks.
That should pull you through some rough patches :)
PS Hurricaines are very stress producing, maybe you were just afraid
and looking for comfort in a candybar.
Be well,
Love
Debbie
