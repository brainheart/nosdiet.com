&gt; I am just thrilled that I followed No S with absolute perfection 
this week.

.......Hey Jeanette congratulations! :) I'm really impressed with 
your perseverence when you might have had a very bad week if you 
didn't have the great NOS guidelines keeping you company...I have to 
say one teeny little thing though...Just yesterday you and Diane 
were comparing perfectionistic tendencies and I *thought* I heard 
you say your new motto is &quot;progress, not perfection&quot;...While, again 

I am really proud of you for having such a successful week, I think 
you are maybe setting yourself up, still, mentally, to try and be 
perfect...from your opening statement. I could be wrong, but well, 
those are your words :) This would be fine if the rest of the road 
wasn't in front of you, but it is. I don't want you to think any 
less of yourself or your efforts in the future if they 
aren't &quot;absolute perfection&quot;...The fact that it worked out perfectly 

was a great bit of news, but again, if you use perfection as your 
goal, you will be setting yourself up for big letdowns when you 
can't attain it...Hey look at me...Just last week I had set a goal 
of getting my 21 days slashed and only made it to 3 out of 5, with a 
doozie of an S weekend to follow... But guess what? I will focus on 
those 3 days. Next time maybe they'll be 4 or 5.. Baby steps here 
folks...Sometimes talk is cheap. (and I do talk alot, but I try not 
to be cheap! LOL ) It would be easy to get bummed out and really 
beat myself up, but I believe this is all going in a positive, and 
successful direction... No ultimate success stories are without 
their setbacks. As I've said in the past, only people who aren't 
going anywhere don't have setbacks....Anyway, please forgive me 
since I really don't want to rain on your parade! I think you are 
really getting somewhere!!! :) And 8 lbs is fantastic :) The first 
weeks usually show the biggest initial loss, so hold tight with that 
for a while and I'm sure there will be more success ahead :) Just 
all that talk about perfection....I had to mention it :) Hope I 
haven't overstepped? :) Let me know if otherwise.

&gt;I am excited because if I can do this on such a stressful week, I 
&gt;can do it ANY WEEK. 
......You are being a good friend towards yourself in this stressful 
time, by doing something which makes you feel better inside :)
Love and Congrats,
Deb :)
