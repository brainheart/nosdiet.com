&gt; while it was alive. If so, you might want to think
&gt; about how to deal with this &quot;production issue.&quot; It's
&gt; definitely easier to resist the call of the fridge if
&gt; there isn't a whole lot in it.

Yes, I can see what you are saying, but it doens't really work that
way....when we butcher a pig let's say, that pig has to last until the 
next
year's pig is ready to butcher. Likewise, we can only hunt every
fall....that meat is all processed and put in the freezer, canned, or what
have you. The way it kind of goes is that we end up eating a lot of poultry
and rabbit in the summer, because nothing else is ready to put up yet.

I only grocery shop every 6 weeks or so (the grocery store is 85 miles 
one
way) I probably have less in my fridge than a lot of city folks do.
Actually, milk and eggs are the major things in my fridge :) But, I have 
3
freezers, shelves of canned food, and jars full of dehydrated stuff. I 
cook
every meal &quot;from scratch&quot; as it is.

My downfall seems to be my own baking I'm afraid. Just grazing all day.
(moo) And junk food that my hubby likes to pick up when he is driving truck
and stops somewhere. And eating more than I should at the dinner
table....big problem. I did the water trick and only having one plate last
night, and survived :) It's a step!
