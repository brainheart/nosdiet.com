would anyone care to give me a list of the

chees fries....)thanks so much ! donna o

Hey Donna...You probably already know what you have to do to curb 
overdoing it on S days, but since you asked...When I have an S day 
it doesn't mean &quot;shoot down&quot; the week and go nuts...It is not easy 

to be perfect and no one is expecting that of you, or really 
anyone...

In the best of all worlds, I attempt to allow myself maybe 
one &quot;snack&quot; and one &quot;sweet&quot;...It doesn't sound like much, given 
that 
the whole week you are really trying to eliminate all that and maybe 
mentally it seems like a &quot;so so&quot; use of S days...But we are all 

trying to undo some pretty ingrained bad habits which no one could 
defend as healthy...It will take time for you to change your 
outlook, so be a little patient...But as Reinhard suggested, and 
most people who have stuck with the plan at least a three week 
period consistently, it does really get easier...There will be bumps 
in the road but just keep moving past them and onward towards your 
goal of developing a newer and healthier you...

If I were looking at your list of S'ses, I would have to say, 
instead of having cake, candy, cookies, ice cream etc...Pick one or 
at *most* two S'ses, your choice...Eat them slowly and relish every 
bite so the experience satisfies you...Over time you will see, as 
some people have posted in the past, that they really enjoy sweets 
on S days more (no guilt involved, you earned it)and unplanned sugar 
consumption is really not as great as it used to be. 

For me personally, it is the &quot;overeating&quot; seconds that creeps up 

once in a while...I had a pizza &quot;bender&quot; the other day, and even 

though it was my meal I had way way way too much...Fortunately, I 
have been No Ssing for over a month and the feeling that went with 
overstuffing myself was so uncomfortable after that it was not an 
experience I wish to have any time soon again...I will view it as a 
setback and I am back on my horse again...
Good luck
May the Force be with you!
Love,
Deb
