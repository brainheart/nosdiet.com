Does anyone else trade S days? It was my son's birthday on a 
Friday, so I used that as an S day and followed the no-s rules on 
Saturday. I figured two days a week of sweets and seconds is 
enough.

Hi Anne, you sound like you are doing all the right things :)
Happy you are feeling like things are proceeding at a healthy and 
enjoyable pace.

Yes,I do trade S days occasionally. There is a no s &quot;Loophole&quot; 

which dictates that an S day can be a &quot;special&quot; day, ie: your 

birthday or a family holiday, etc...as long as you aren't making, as 
Reinhard said, &quot;your cousins hamsters birthday&quot; an S day, you can be 

somewhat flexible.

As for me personally, I only allow myself Snacks, like a special 
video and popcorn evening, or a really nice sweet, like some ice 
cream....And I try (key word is &quot;try&quot;) to only have one S day a 
week.

I'm not sure if it's allowed in the S rules anyway, but, regardless, 
one rule I keep throughout the week, including the weekend, is &quot;no 

seconds&quot;. I am thrilled at this point in my life, that with this 
plan I have developed a normal, healthy appetite and don't feel the 
need anymore to stuff myself to the gills, most of that stuffing was 
a result of bordom or sadness anyway, not hunger...I think that 
overeating is never a good thing because it disrespects what your 
body really needs, and it simply doesn't need to be overfull, just 
full. Even when I have a sweet dessert to look forward to, if I am 
really stuffed already, from a filling meal, I would rather postpone 
eating my sweet for a time when it isn't going to be the &quot;one last 

bite&quot; that pushes my full stomach over the edge...(did any of you 

see Monty Pythons &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;?, theres a gross-out scene 

where a big fat guy has so much food and keeps saying &quot;one last 
bite&quot;.
At the end of the scene they bring him a teeny tiny mint, he eats it 
and explodes! LOL Yuch!

Congrats on your achievements, and hope you had a nice time with 
your son :)
Peace and Love,
Debbie
