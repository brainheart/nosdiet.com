Hi Linda,

Welcome to the group. It's absolutely OK to post this.
That's the whole point of this group.

I'll give my standard advice: 

1. Be strict about the rules. The stricter you are up
front the faster you'll build your habit and the less
work you'll have to do long term. 

2. No self-revenge if you run into trouble. Not only
is it unpleasant in itself, it's an excuse to fail. 

3. Remember that this is long term. Don't step on the
scale every five minutes. Of if you must, do as Allan
suggested recently and average out the weights over a
long period of time so you aren't thrown by short term
fluctuations.

4. Post to the group if you run into trouble or even
just to check in. It's good both for restoring your
morale if you're down and to foster a sense of
accountability. Even though you're not strictly
speaking &quot;accountable&quot; to anyone here, there's nothing
like announcing your decision to a crowd of 150+ to
remind you that it really happened and you aren't just
messing around.

Looking forward to hearing more from you,

Reinhard

&gt; I weigh 167 and 
&gt; am 5'5&quot;. I hate being fat(over weight). I found this

&gt; typed in the seach words,&quot;help i'm fat&quot;. I like the
&gt; No S diet, ideal. 
&gt; So here I go. tomarrow is day 1. 
&gt; I hope it was ok to post this.
