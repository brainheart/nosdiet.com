I had this problem for several weeks and then I started to limit my fats
too, which isn't exaactly NoS in theory, but it has worked and I am about
12pounds down, with a bit of fluctuation going on too, but the general 
trend
is down.
It might be what happens if you weren't eating all that much to start with
as I know I wasn't.

&gt; I have been delighted with this new way of eating but I am having 
a
problem.
&gt; The first 10 days I lost about 5 pounds! My weight fluctuates a bit so 
I
&gt; wasn't surprised to gain a few pounds back and then lose one. This
process has
&gt; continued and I have gained back 4.5 to 5 pounds. Now I am not cheating
or
&gt; going crazy on the weekends. My way of limiting the amount of food is 
to
eat only
&gt; what I can put on one plate. No stacking! Also if I don't get hungry 
for
the
&gt; next meal I am sure that I ate too much at the earlier one. I try to 
make
&gt; sure that doesn't happen. Any suggestions? Please don't say write 
down
&gt; everything you eat. I have tried that in the past and it just makes 
me
crazy! Thanks
&gt; for any help. I am not giving up and must start seriously exercising
though
&gt; my life is busy with my family and running a business. In other words 
I
am not
&gt; just sitting on the couch all day. Thanks, Sophie
&gt;
