wow ! talk about the question of all questions ! yes, it would seem logical 

that if you eat when you are hungary, and don't eat when you are not ( 
like
so 
called normal people) then your body would reach it's ideal weight and food 

would no longer be an issue. this is how it works for me...( confession
time) 
being that i have spent 20 years of my life dieting, starving
binging /purging (don't purge anymore, although at my worst a purged 5 or 6 

times a day)and binging/starving and just plain old compulsively eating 

(angry, sad, mad .bored etc)
i have lost the ability to tell when i am hungry a lot of the time.... like 

when i am sad, mad, stressed, bored, etc. therefore i must have a built in 

control.... 3 moderate, reasonably healthy tasty meals a day with NO SNACKS,
NO 
SWEETS AND NO SECONDS . this is my ticket to sanity ( thanks no s'ers) 

although 
i have not managed to string together 21 consecutive days yet, i am moving 

slowly in that direction. i am no longer tortured by the continuous
question of 
' am i hungry? do i need to eat? ' if i am eating and it is not a meal
time 
i can no longer delude myself into thinking that it is ok... much luck to 

you, lurker
hope my experience sheds some light on your own journey donna o
