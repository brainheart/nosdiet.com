well i find i have to eat lower carb foods or its all over for me
so i planned my thanksgiving that way i did eat the one meal at dinner and had a bit 
of everything that was served including bread, stuffing and potatoes and i was just 
plain full and that was all i could eat i am surprised i recovered and went back to 
life as normal because in the past i have done the 10 day binge thing 
a few weeks ago before i got a grip i was having a real problem everything was an S 
day every day was someones birthday at the office or some reason to eat out or bring 
in treats so now now more of that for me .. and even on S days they will be meals . 
and healthy meals .. and if i choose to add a dessert or bread on those days with my 
meal thats fine

&gt; i did good i read not to skip meals on thanksgiving so i did not
&gt; we lost our power for the day so i had to go cook over at a 
friends house 
&gt; that also helped with no snacking as there was nothing to snack on 

&gt; i ate and cleaned up and packed the food away we did not even 
have dessert other than some fresh fruit salad as we were all too 
full .. and the only thing left over was turkey and green beans so 
that has been what i have eaten for dinner the past few days 
&gt; so i did not even gain a pound from the holiday that felt good
