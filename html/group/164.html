Woohoo to you, Kevin! That's teriffic that you are losing your taste for
sugars. Sooner or later, you will see the pounds come off. In the
meantime, you are getting healthier and forming better habits. And that, 
to
me, definitely counts as progress. :) Keep up the good work.

I totally agree with your thanks to Reinhardt. Great site, great tips, 
good
people and always good for a chuckle or two.

Lynda

Subject: [nosdiet] Just a little update on me.


I've ran through a few hard times these last few weeks, working 6 days 
a
week, 16 hours a day for at least 4, and 8 the others doesn't promote good
eating, at least for me. I've found ways around that..Changing weekend 
days
to Wed and Friday, the hardest days to get through for me. Adding a couple
extra &quot;special&quot; days with a birthday and wedding in there. I have not 
lost
weight yet, at all...Possibly because I don't get in the exercise I should.
I squeeze in what I can, I carry the heavy boxes, and give the light ones 
to
my assistants, I stay on my feet as much as possible, but I just don't 
feel
the drive to do &quot;exercieses&quot; when I get home. Anyway, I have not bought 
pop
since I started the diet, and last night I had grabbed a 24 oz pepsi from 
my
cousin, and couldn't even drink half of it. That made me feel good.
I'd like to thank you once again for sharing your diet ideas for one and
all,
and not try to market it in a book and call yourself a professor of
Dietology. So thanks! And hopefully I'll start seeing those pounds fall
off
since my appitite for the sugars has gone down.

Kevin

&gt; glad to hear all is back to normal. Have been away and for a while 
made
&gt; every day an S day. My neice said she lost a lot on weight watchers,
&gt; and they allow a little sugar, but that was too much effort in
&gt; weighing, planning, and my life is too busy. The no S diet is the
&gt; easiest and does seem to work for me. Bonnie

&gt; ....I hope.
&gt;
&gt; It took verizon a full week to fix the problem. The
&gt; diagnosis: squirrels munching through the wire. Darn
&gt; beasts must be on atkins.
