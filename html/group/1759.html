&gt; hi guys
&gt; I made myself a promise that I would post no matter what. I've 
found in the
&gt; past that I will write in a diary for example, when things are 
going well.
&gt; well, everything was ok till late this afternoon at work. and I 
had a small
&gt; packet of crisps.
&gt; but all day I was thinking about how I'd go off the rails when I 
got home.
&gt; I had thought to myself that I would email now, around dinner 
time, each
&gt; night cos it is my difficult time and thinking of you and your 
successes
&gt; would help keep me on track. I still think it will, but today 
isn't the day.
&gt; I am about to go for a walk, and I hope I will come home to just 
one meal,
&gt; but I doubt it.
&gt; I will not berate myself, but I get worried and puzzled that I 
have trouble
&gt; building a 3 wk habit (ie it is only day one).
&gt; things were muddled so breakfast (yoghurt &amp; sunflower seeds and a 

little
&gt; flaxseed oil) wasn't till about 10.30. I had thought I was meeting 

a friend
&gt; for lunch but that's tomorrow, so I hadn't bought any lunch with 
me.
&gt; Then work was busy and I bought a sandwich and kransky sausage at 

about
&gt; 3.45.
&gt; So I know that this all doesn't help - cos it isn't the ideal.
&gt; Group I need you, and I have promised myself I will post each day 

til I get
&gt; the 3 weeks up. I hope you can bear it.
&gt; bye for now
&gt; jen
&gt; HI Jen, I am Julie and a newbie in this group- Dont be so hard on 

yourself you have had a rough time of it and what you had for 
breakfast isnt that bad you know. Could of been a candy bar:). I try 
minute by minute sometimes. Also I have found in all my dieting 
years that a big glass of water will fill me up when i know i cant 
eat yet. I have a sandwich quite often at work for lunch with some 
fruit- nothing wrong with that- bread meat cheese all healthy,. 
Anyway hang in there girl- one day at a time. Julie
