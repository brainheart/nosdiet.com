Hi Maxine,

Don't despair. You have enormous temptations given
your line of work. But this is also why it's so
important to be clear about what's off limits *and* to
have adequate replacements. If you need soda then make
it diet soda. Don't feel guilty about it. It's better
than pounds of sugar a week. If you can't pass up the
free food, recognize this fact in advance and think
about which offerings are most acceptable. Be
realistic. If there's no way you're going to settle
for the salad with 0 cal dressing (do they even have
that?) then go for the next best thing. There's no
sense in being a saint on paper and then wolfing down
a big mac and a shake because you can't live up to
this ideal.

Don't let the difficulty of your situation get you
down. Think how impressive it will be when you lose
weight despite all of these temptations. Now *that*
will be worth a documentary.

We're all rooting for you,

Reinhard

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I am starting again. I feel really good when I
&gt; stick to the no s so I dont know why I have trouble
&gt; sticking to it. But so far I have done good today. 
&gt; The soda for some reason has gotten harder then
&gt; before. I know part of it is because I work in fast
&gt; food and that is one thing that is free all day as
&gt; much as i want. But I havent had any today. I want
&gt; to keep getting your emails. They are an
&gt; inspiration to me.
