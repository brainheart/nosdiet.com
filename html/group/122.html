Hi Lee,

I should have added carbonation to my list of soda
replacement criteria... good point. Because it's *so*
physically similar to pop, right down to the packaging
and sound effects, it might make it that much easier
to to pull off the swap. It's also probably more
hydrating than caffeinated drinks.

And for what it's worth, I give my blessing to frozen
bananas :-).

&gt; Is it the sweet or the carbonation that has you
&gt; hooked? Believe it or
&gt; not, carbonated mineral water can help to curb the
&gt; carbonation part of it.
&gt; It may take a little getting used to, but I became
&gt; addicted to it when
&gt; I went to Italy. It helped to curb any craving I had
&gt; for a soda and
&gt; it is much healthier. It ain't mountain dew, but it
&gt; might be worth a
&gt; try if it is the fizz that you are really hooked to.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing for the fruit/sweet jones....I'm not
&gt; sure if this serves
&gt; as a cheap trick to fool the sweet taste buds, that
&gt; we techincally
&gt; shouldn't employ, but freezing slices of banana and
&gt; keeping them in a
&gt; well sealed bag works to curb the sweet tooth a bit.
&gt; You have to like
&gt; bananas, I guess, but it seems like a good way to
&gt; get the fruit in and
&gt; the frozen aspect makes it taste like a creamier
&gt; treat than the
&gt; straight shot of banana. Reinhard would have to make
&gt; a call on that one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Congratulations on making it your first weekend,
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; &gt; if it was only part of a week and there were
&gt; some
&gt; &gt; &gt; stretchers. If it takes a few days to find your
&gt; &gt; &gt; stride, don't worry about it. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Strictness is a tool, not an end in itself. But
&gt; I find
&gt; &gt; &gt; that strictness makes it easier, and it's what
&gt; I'd
&gt; &gt; &gt; advise most people to try. I'm thrilled that
&gt; Teresa
&gt; &gt; &gt; has lost weight using No-s, and I don't begrudge
&gt; her
&gt; &gt; &gt; her few candy corns (congratulations, Teresa,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; sorry for responding to two posts at once). But
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; personally would rather not have to worry about
&gt; &quot;some&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; turning into &quot;way too much.&quot; &quot;No&quot; is harder 
to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, at the mid point of day 2, let me tell
&gt; you a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit more about my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;situation.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I work in the athletic department of a high
&gt; school. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not a teacher, I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a coach, I just do random stuff. I'm
&gt; basically
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an assistant athletic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; director, though this district doesn't
&gt; officially
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have one. The point of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this, is I make dirt for money, but the
&gt; department
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes up for it by giving
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me kick backs. Coke, which we stock the
&gt; machines
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; throughout the school, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sell at sporting events, is mine for the
&gt; taking (and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dasani water is what we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sell, which is the sodium containing
&gt; water...yuk).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is kinda the point where it doesn't
&gt; matter if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm late, so long as I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in by the time school starts, I'm SUPPOSED to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there a half hour ahead of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway...Yesterday I did well, until I
&gt; realized I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was going to dinner with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some old co-workers, we went to Baker's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Square...Couldn't pass up some pie,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I kinda made it a special day, that was all
&gt; I did
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though, no snacks, no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pop.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today at work, first we get the concession
&gt; stand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delivery in, so what do I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do for a half hour? Yeah, I stick M&amp;M's and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Snickers on a shelf. That was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard to pass up, but I made it. Then we get a
&gt; fund
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raiser rep. in showing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us his different candy options, and since last
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he came around, we got
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him 2 of our coaches buying from him, he gave
&gt; us
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free samples...We each got
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about 5 bags of M&amp;M's. Wow, was it hard not
&gt; eating
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them on the way home.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll save 'em for those S days though.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right now, I'm hungry, and wanting a snack, so
&gt; I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gonna go mow the lawn. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guess 2 good things will come about with this,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; housework will get done too,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'eh?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again for listening, and giving out
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole idea.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kevin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I'm treading the thin line between fat and
&gt; phat.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome and good luck! Here's my take on the
&gt; two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues you raise:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the pop, nothing beats water,
&gt; obviously,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you might want to consider tea as well. If
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of those hot water spigots at the cooler
&gt; it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fast, and if they give away pop, they
&gt; probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away tea, too. If you are sensitive to
&gt; caffeine,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; green
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tea is very weak and supposed to have all
&gt; kinds of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; health benefits. Herbal teas have no
&gt; caffeine. I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crazy about tea, I prefer coffee, but it's
&gt; just so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy and less contentious in terms of
&gt; health. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hot, so you drink it slow, and the little
&gt; ritual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the tea bag seems to fulfill my &quot;looking 
for
&gt; oral
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distraction&quot; requirement.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the pop-tarts/nutrigrain bars for
&gt; breakfast
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issue, I'm not a picky eater, and since my
&gt; wife
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get up way before I do, I tend not to be
&gt; in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; huge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rush in the mornings. So I can't speak to
&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from vast personal experience.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've always considered cold cereal pretty
&gt; quick,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it sounds like you need to be out so fast
&gt; you're
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating in the car... not the most conducive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; environment to cheerio consumption. You
&gt; know, 5
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes might put cold cereal within
&gt; striking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; range.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would setting the alarm clock 5 minutes
&gt; earlier be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the question? Or could you keep a stash
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cereal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and milk at work? Or do what I do, keep a
&gt; stash of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oatmeal, nuts and dried fruit at work
&gt; (though I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usually eat this for lunch). If you could do
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these it would expand your horizons
&gt; significantly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are *a lot* of different kinds of
&gt; low/no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sugar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cereal.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bread is also a big category - it's not just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; toasted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wonder or thomases english muffins. Mix it
&gt; up with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different cheese and a different piece of
&gt; fruit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning and even the same old bread can seem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novel. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't know your exact tastes in this
&gt; depeartment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spend some time seriously scoping out the
&gt; bakery,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cheese and fruit sections are your
&gt; supermarket.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll wrack my brains about it a bit, but for
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being I'd suggest not letting this problem
&gt; be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breaker for you. Pop tarts are clearly out.
&gt; But
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nutrigrain bars might be considered
&gt; temporarily
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exempt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until you can think of something less
&gt; sugary.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, they are *marketed* as healthy, and all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considered, are probably less awful for you
&gt; than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pop
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarts. Emphasis on 'temporary,' and don't
&gt; let it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every day. Hopefully you'll get enough
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alternatives
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested here in this group (and by the
&gt; mother of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invention) that you won't have to resort to
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often/at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I stumbled upon this site today through

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't remember
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question I had, but it wasn't even
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loss. I decided
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this may very well be the way I've
&gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for to loose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight all this time. I've gained ~60
&gt; pounds in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last 4 years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most being in the last 2 years. The other
&gt; night
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to stop drinking pop like I
&gt; do...Which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constantly. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard since I get it free at work, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water here has a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant amount of sodium, so you just
&gt; end up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more thirsty after
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drinking it, but I'm gonna do it. This is
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step up for me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I'm pretty sure I can handle most of
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the bat, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of it soon. Thanks for making this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; availible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now for a question that I know has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addressed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not &quot;to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfaction.&quot; Breakfast, I wake up
&gt; litterally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minutes before I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to be at work, and it's a 20
&gt; minute
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (yes I'm late
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every day, but that's a whole 'nother
&gt; story)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nutrigrain bars and pop
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarts have been a Godsend to me. Not only
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm a VERY picky
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eater, and most common breakfast foods are
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liking. I do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love a good bowl of Cheerios or something
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I frankly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't have the time for them. Toast is
&gt; great,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; english muffins
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too...but every day? I don't think I'd
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that...Any other ideas

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; addressed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I either
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glanced over it or missed it in the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sorry
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it is just a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repeat. Thanks for the help!!
