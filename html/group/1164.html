Thanks to everyone for their encouragement on my big starting day.
Reinhard, you have a very friendly and helpful group here (as I'm sure 
you
know)!



From: &quot;Alison PB&quot; &lt;alisonpb@...&gt;
(By the by, I'm also on the Low Carb UK list and saw your reference to 
this
site there - thanks!)

Oh--ahem--you're welcome! I was wondering if anyone from there would see 
me
here. =) I'm sort of &quot;going over to other side&quot; but it was time to 
admit
that what I was doing (or not able to stick to) wasn't working. I hope 
my
posts on these two lists don't appear too contradictory or hypocritical! 
At
least low-carbing has given me some healthier food preferences, but I just
can't keep to the really low levels that seem necessary for progress.



From: &quot;Kate Ann&quot; &lt;kateann@...&gt;
My question is....about eating in the car.....what kind of car do you have
that has a refrigerator and stove so that you can fix food and eat during 
a
30 minute drive? LOL



Very funny! =P As I'm sure you could guess, there was a bag of potato
chips in the back seat, and the car has a predilection for turning into
drive-through's. Thanks for your ideas. I love accomplishing two things 
at
once, so I will try combining (isotonic?) exercise and breathing with
driving...when I can spare time from drinking water, making phone calls, 
and
cleaning out my purse. ;-) (No, I'm not really that scary on the road.)



From: Reinhard Engels &lt;beautiful_idiot@...&gt;
(Re: taking S's one at a time...)
Sorry it didn't work. It was an intriguing idea.

I had trouble figuring out why I gave up the idea, but I think it's because
during the past weeks when I was paying more attention to my habits, I
realized (subconsciously until now) that my &quot;bad&quot; snacks are always 
sweets.
Since I was LC-ing, I tended often to go find a piece of cheese or some
nuts, but I would mainly do that if I was really hungry. When I was bored
or annoyed or avoiding work (!), I'd want a comforting cup of tea or coffee,
and something sweet with it. I've always been a cookie monster, and though
I've trained myself to be content with only 1, 2 or 3 (if small), it would
be better to have none, or one after a meal. The trouble is, I enjoy sweets
much more between meals, with a hot drink. I don't care about dessert after
a meal. And I don't like sugar in tea or coffee--I want the sweet on the
side.



I haven't quite resolved this cup of tea problem. I love tea, but I don't
really enjoy it by itself. I think I'm learning, though. For one thing, 
it
needs to be really GOOD tea, and then I can appreciate the flavor alone.
Well, anyway, it might just come down to whether I'm more determined to
satisfy my taste buds or to fit into my clothes. =) Only I can decide
that.



Thanks for your other insights into hungry/full and mealtimes. I have known
for a long time exactly what started my snacking and weight problem. When 
I
was a kid, coming home from school was the time to drop the books, change
clothes, get comfortable, and HAVE A SNACK. As I recall, I was rarely
hungry, but it always sounded like a good idea--a sort of reward after 
a
long day. My mother, excellent in every respect--cooking healthy, not
allowing junk or sodas, etc.--may have steered me a bit wrong here. She
would ask us, &quot;Would you like a snack?&quot; to be nice, I'm sure, and maybe 
9
kids out of 10 could handle after-school snacks without having a weight
problem later, but if I ever have children, the question will be different.
Perhaps, &quot;How about a glass of water?&quot; =P



Well, I started typing this days ago but was too busy to finish, and now 
I'm
a week and a half into the project. I'm doing so-so. I have avoided
outright snacking, have no potato chips stashed in the car, and have been
more hungry at proper mealtimes, but as I might have expected, skipping 
the
small sweets has been more difficult. I started well but began making
exceptions after about 5 days. So maybe I am taking the S's one at a time
after all! I don't have a very &quot;absolute&quot; personality--I am generally 
nice
to other people and constantly making allowances for them, and I am &quot;nice&quot;
to myself as well: &quot;Yes, dear, I suppose you can have a small
something--you've eaten moderately all day. One little treat won't hurt.&quot;
I'd rather have two chocolates every day than a hot fudge sundae on the
weekend! It's a continuous learning process but I do think I'm making
progress.



I was thinking that the oft-used joke &quot;No thyself&quot; is a very 
appropriate
saying for this plan, and considering how much we learn about ourselves
while trying to change our habits, it would be equally appropriate to use
the original, &quot;Know thyself&quot;!



Thanks again for the input and other people's progress reports. I'll be
back with a final wrap-up in 10 days!



Diane
