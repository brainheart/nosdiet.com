Hi Bonnie :)
Don't underestimate how much your daily walking is helping you.
It may not be causing you to lose weight, but I am really willing to 
place money on it that it is keeping you from gaining...
Lets face it ladies, something happens to our bodies somewhere 
between 30 and 40 and it takes much more to lose and much less to 
gain. So not gaining is really great when you think of the other 
option.
Please, if you were ever considering whether it is worth doing this 
walking since &quot;they are thinner&quot; than you, and you are just staying 

the same, don't give up your walking! It is also a great way to 
enhance your mood on the positive side, and for women who may be 
concerned about staying bone healthy, the vitamin d from the sun,and 
the low impact all help maintain healthy bones, when people are 
diagnosed with osteoporosis, the common exercise suggested by health 
professionals is...
Walking or golfing...The sun light helps raise serontonin (feel good 
neurotransmitter) and Vitamin D, necessary for calcium intake in the 
bones.
I dated a very slim mailman one year, who as part of his delivery 
route, walked about 10 miles a day, and he climbed an inordinate 
amount of stairs.
He told me that the one time that he had to stay home due to an 
injury of some sort (oh he broke his hand) Within, one month he 
gained 30 lbs not changing his eating at all, and just from the 
change of his metabolism... He used to be able to eat like crazy 
because the exercise was burning so much that basically he was like a 
walking food furnace...When that abrupt halt in activity came, so did 
the pounds, since he was eating like crazy, he started gaining like 
crazy.
Walking is really underrated, but when you hear stories like his, one 
realizes that it does change your body's metabolism in a positive way.
Maybe start adding some hills to your walking route to push your body 
a little harder? You are inspiring me to get up now! 
So is your son cute?
LOL just kidding!
Musicians, can't live without them, but take my advice, just buy the 
CD and run like hell!
PS I am a guitarist/singer too, LOL
mainly Dylan and Dead stuff
Love,
Debbie

&gt; Dear Debbie,
&gt; My son is in his 30's and is a music teacher and in several 
bands,
&gt; mostly guitar, and won't marry as it is too hard on a family , so I 

can
&gt; imagine it was hard for you...it is that way being with any artist, 

that is
&gt; only into their art. I for one am a painter, but that comes second 

to my
&gt; marriage of 41 years to the same man. His only art is old car 
restoration.
&gt; Anyway one can overdo on French Cuisine, but I never did all the 
years in
&gt; Europe. I thought it was the active life syle, but perhaps it was 

the
&gt; similiar to no S diet at the time!
&gt; My husband and neighbor and I walk 40 mins every morning...I see a
&gt; difference in both of them-much slimmer, but it does help keep my 

blood
&gt; pressure down, but does not do much for me in the weight department.
