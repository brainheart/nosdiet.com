APJ:

I'm a seconds man myself. Not sure if you've seen the
poll at:



Snacks is winning by a large margin, so your vote is
critical!

I haven't put up a new poll in a while, but the old
ones are all still open. About half the group has
joined since the last poll was announced, so many of
you may not be aware of their existence. You can see
them all in the &quot;polls&quot; tab at the side of the group
home page, or just click here:



I think you've got a good sense of the issues
involved, APJ, that it's going to take patience. Don't
hesitate to bug us if you have questions or feel
you're faltering (or just want to brag).

Saleta:

Self help tends to take itself dreadfully seriously, I
guess in the hope that other people will. But crazy is
a great mnemonic device. If somethings a little nuts,
you'll remember it. I call it the principle of comic
pragmatism. It's a joke, but it's also serious. It's
effective *because* it's a joke.

And besides, as the good book says:

&quot;If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this
world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.&quot;

Bulimia, huh? I guess my saying about the diet working
both ways might actually get put to the test. Keep us
posted. I'm very curious (and hopeful).

Best of luck to you both,

Reinhard
