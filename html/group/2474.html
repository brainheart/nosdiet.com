reply to this email and then I hit a button and deleted it...grrrrr.. lol.

....Hi Carrie Poersch (I bet you heard your share of racecar jokes=20
when you were a kid! LOL :)

Thanks again for the info Carrie.. There may be something to those 3=20
servings, but I'm sure that the Dairy Industry is still emphasising=20
the selected facts that will help sell milk, not Kombu Seaweed or=20
Almonds :)
I looked at the articles you posted and wanted to make a little=20
point to add my two cents to your two cents so we would have four=20
cents...
The studies were comparing, calicium intake from 3 servings of=20
dairy, versus 1 serving of dairy plus an 800mg calcium=20
suppliment/pill, and then compared it to a very calcium poor diet...
I believe that the reason their studies point towards the three=20
servings theory being the best is twofold.
1. It is obvious that if you eat you will stimulate your metabolism,=20
better than if you starve yourself.. So these mini meal, dairy=20
additions are good for stimulating your overall ability to turn on=20
you inner calorie burner...
2. It isn't widely known, but Calcium can only be absorbed at a=20
certain rate... I believe that the most calcium you can absorb in=20
one dose is 500 milligrams.... So those 800 milligram=20
pills/suppliments are basically throwing 300 milligrams of=20
Calcium &quot;down the toilet&quot;.... So even if the calories remain 
the=20
same in the two scenarios, if it's the calcium that makes or breaks=20
the difference in the overall burned fat/calories, at the end of the=20
day, the 3 servings rule works because it introduces the calcium=20
into our systems more efficiently...

&gt;&gt;Personally when I started NoS I would occasionally have a glass 
of=20
chocolate milk with breakfast. For me having that bit of chocolate=20
helped me keep from totally binging on chocolate later.=20

....Hey if this is actually helping you from going nuts later, then=20
by all means please help yourself... If it were *me* I would wind up=20
drinking the whole gallon in one day (with help from Richard of=20
course!)
Please keep sending the info, I just enjoy picking it all apart=20
because it's my nature to do that... It's fun for me, but I don't=20
want it to discourage you or anyone from sharing feelings or info or=20
science...It's all grist for the mill :)
Peace and Love,
Deb :)
