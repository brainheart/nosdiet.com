&gt; This week I will not be that good, but will try and even if it's 
only 75 percent, it is better than not at all.

....Hey Bonnie :) A planned &quot;not that good&quot; week is sure to be much 

better than an unplanned, unconscious binge... I'm sure your 
excesses won't do too much damage overall.. Hey it should be fun on 
Christmas and just respect your bodies signals...

&gt;Deb, your note was beautiful.. remember to take good care of 
yourself for yourself and your little boy is most important. Glad to 
hear you have a good attitude and are doing better now!
&gt; Love, Bonnie

....Thanks a lot BonBon and Leelee! I guess experiencing, even sad 
and upsetting feelings are better than just going on and being 
complacent about something as important as caring for myself....I 
have always been someone elses care giver, and waited for someone to 
come along and care for me as much as I cared for them....This 
should be secondary to self/love (not the narcissistic brand) and 
self/care....I realize now that, with God and my little man, Richie, 
and of course you great friends! I have all the support I really 
need to achieve my dreams. By the way, thanks for mentioning taking 
care of myself and my son but, if you knew Richard personally, you 
would realize that in many ways, our roles are often reversed...He 
cares for me, without fail, when I need a hug or a kind word... He 
is the best kid ever! I am often a disfunctional mess at home, just 
in terms of my mood swings, and do you know what he said last 
night? 
&quot;If I could choose any parent in the world, you would always be the 

best one for me!&quot; This kid is pure sweetness personified, and more 

than once I have wondered what have I done in life to deserve 
someone this great? It must have something *reeeealllly* good.
I thank God every day. 
Well I was out for about an hour, shovelling snow and scraping off 
all the ice and stuff from my car...it was fun and it makes me feel 
good to get fresh air and get out of the house.
Now for some coffee and thawing out :)
Peace,
Deb :)
