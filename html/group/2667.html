As the subject line has stated, I have had a great week! What is 
ingenious about this diet is that you can eat almost anything you 
want during mealtime! I've had pancakes and eggs for breakfast, 
turkey sandwich with chips for lunch, steak and mashed potatoes with 
a salad for dinner. I'm not worrying about carbs, fats, 
calories...etc. I'm just eating regular food, but not a lot of it! 
Most importantly, I'm not finishing my kids food, but throwing it 
right into the trash! (I am so proud of myself.) :) This week for 
my s days, I had some cookies with tea on one day, and a Coke and 
some more cookies (they were great homemade chocolate/ chocolate 
chip)on the next day! I have been able to stick to three meals a 
day easily since I'm not worrying about WHAT to eat, but HOW MUCH 
I'm eating! My husband has been so proud of me that he is also 
doing this diet. (And I hate calling it a diet since it is just so 
common sense eating!) We're going to treat ourselves to a piece of 
cheesecake this weekend if we both do well during the week! Now all 
I have to do is get back to the gym! haha
