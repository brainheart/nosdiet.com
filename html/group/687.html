Curd cheese is a smooth cheese made from curdled milk. I don't know what 
it
might be called in other parts of the world. I am in England.the German
Quark is just about the same. You will need to talk to someone who runs 
a
good Deli. It has the texture of creamed butter, but don't try that. It 
is
used to make cheesecakes as an alternative to cream cheese, but only has
moderate amounts of fat. Cream cheese is very fat. Good hunting. please 
let
me know your local name for it. If you have Czechs in your area, they would
know it as &quot;Tvaroh&quot;. It definitely is a simple cheese and not fermented 
like
yoghurt.

&gt;
&gt; Someone described eating raw veggies dipped in Ranch dressing as an
evening
&gt; meal. Here is a recipe for a tasty dip with not too much fat in it.
&gt; 1 tub curd cheese (Quark is a possible alternative cottage cheese is 
too
&gt; grainy)
&gt; 1 small tub natural unsweetened yoghurt.
&gt; A few salad onions or scallions.
&gt; 2 teaspoons powdered sweet paprika
&gt; A little salt.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Put the curd cheese into a bowl and stir in yoghurt until consistency 
is
&gt; right for dipping. Chop the salad onions (green and white parts).into
rounds
&gt; about 1/10inch thick. Stir into the dip.Season with a little salt. Add 
the
&gt; paprika, a little at a time and mix thoroughly until the dip turns 
a
salmon
&gt; pink.Chill before serving.
&gt; This dip is very tasty on celery sticks and carrots.
&gt; Enjoy Hanadr47
