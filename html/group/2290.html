It's amazing how alike most of us with a weight problem are. I bet a lot of 

us are &quot;recovering perfectionists.&quot; For too long we walked (or tried to 

walk) the tightrope of diet perfection, and after &quot;messing up,&quot; we always 

said exactly the same thing (quoted below). Although I still have a long 

way to go, at least I can thankfully say that for many years now I have 

avoided that particular trap. When I decided I really hated the stuffed 

feeling, and no emotion or food was worth the risk of having it, and when I 

let go of the perfection fixation, binges just stopped happening. The 
spiral of self-hatred *for* overeating and self-punishment *by* overeating 

just can't get started any more.

Somewhere I saw the motto &quot;Progress, not perfection.&quot; Since perfection is 

not attainable (at least, not by anyone I know!), I am sure this motto is 

the one we all must adopt, or we never will make progress...! You can't 

fall off the path of progress like you can the path of perfection, because 

every mistake is just part of the learning process and therefore part of the 

progress. Of course, if we don't learn from our mistakes, that's something 

else.

Well, I know this is nothing new or profound but at least whoever is feeling 

alone can know there's yet *another* person just like you. =)

I always used to fall into the trap of thinking, &quot;Well I've already
screwed up so I might as well go ahead and have some of this and
that...&quot;. It's hard but I am starting to get a grip on that thinking.
