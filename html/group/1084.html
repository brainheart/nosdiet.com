Hi,
Welcome back to NoS. I think it will be easier for you to reach your goal
and maintain it doing NoS than doing the warrior diet you mentioned.

Just curious... You mentioned you liked the philosophy behind the warrior
diet. What is the philosophy behind eating most of your calories at night?
It is not something I would choose to do, but I am curious as to what the
creators of this diet believe are the benefits of eating at night.

Good luck in reaching your goal. We look forward to your updates.

And no...it is not just you. Reinhard definitely has a future in comedy!

Lynda

Subject: [nosdiet] NoS Diet again


I am hoping the reason I did not get a response from my first post is
because people missed it? Anyway, I just want to say that I will be
trying this diet again. I was doing it but then I stumbled across a
diet called Warrior Diet (basically, undereat on veggies/little
protein during day and then eat most of your calories at night). I
liked the philosophy behind it but decided it was too extreme for me
right now. I am going to try to get these NO S habits in my head and
make them automatic before trying the WD. I plan on posting monthly
results, starting from Aug. 1 (next month). As of right now, I am
roughly 170 lbs, with a 35 or 36. in waist. My goal is 150 lbs and
10% bodyfat (I think this translates into mebbe 31 in. waist?).

I realize these goals might be more specific than some others so you
might find it harder to relate but any encouagement is appreciated. I
enjoy reading all your posts. (Is it me or does Reinhard have the
potential to do irreverent comedy? :-)).
