&gt; HI There Richie,

I saw your picture and you are so cute !! And I'm not just saying 
that because I am a friend of your Moms. I think its great you are 
posting now, its about time! :) We are all really proud of you, we 
know its been hard to not do what all the other kids do every day. 
Your Mom must really love you alot to care about your health and 
what you eat :). My daughter Shelley is 14 and started NOS with me 
last OCt. she has lost close to 20# I believe. 
Did you have a nice Valentines Day today ? Did you make your Mom a 
Valentines Card? Be sure to have a sweet today since its a special 
day.
Love Jools

&gt; 
&gt; Hey Ivy :)
&gt; This is my first group post on Nos. You aren't the youngest person 

&gt; on Nos, I am :) I'm 8 (turning 9 on March 29). Good luck on Nos! 
&gt; Since I've been doing Nos with my Mom, I've been better with 
eating, 
&gt; and I'm really happy that I did :)
&gt; I used to eat candy every day which I thought HAD to happen. Hey 
&gt; Reinhard and everyone else, the thing I like about Nos is that you 

&gt; don't cut out on sweets PERMANENTLY! Please write back when you 
have 
&gt; time :) I don't have my own account, I'm using my Mom's.
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Richie
&gt; P.S. Happy S Day!
