Hi Jill. I have been on this &quot;diet&quot; for a month now and have lost 5 

pounds. I too do not eat any sugar during the week and on the 
weekend I have one sugary item. I find that by allowing myself that 
one treat on the weekend, it gives me the willpower to last the 
week. By about Wednesday I'm thinking something sweet would be nice 
and then I think only three more days to go! I have switched to 
Stevia for my morning tea and have cut out all diet pop and regular 
pop completely. Good Luck Jill!

&gt; Well I am pretty good about having no sugar on Mon-Fri. When I 
have a
&gt; craving, I just keep in mind &quot;Hey, I can have it (whatever type 
of
&gt; sweet treat i happen to be craving) on Saturday and/or Sunday&quot;. I 

try
&gt; to let myself have one soft drink and one dessert per day of the
&gt; weekend. Granted that is my plan that I stuck to last weekend, 
seeing
&gt; as how I've only been on this plan for about 10 days now. I did 
lose 2
&gt; lbs though already :)! Best wishes to you, keep us posted on your
&gt; decisions and successes.

&gt; &gt; Hi. I just found the Nosdiet website while searching for advice 

&gt; &gt; on how to get off of sugar. Do most of you abstain from sugar 

&gt; &gt; entirely? If so, how did you go off -- just cold turkey? If 
not, do 
&gt; &gt; you feel plagued by sugar cravings on the days you don't eat 

&gt; &gt; sugar. I'm very much up in the air about how I want to do 
this. 
&gt; &gt; I've been playing around with one system -- but, I'm afraid, 

&gt; &gt; playing around is the right phrase. I like the simplicity of 

this 
&gt; &gt; plan, but I think I may need to make the &quot;no sugar&quot; a permanent 

&gt; &gt; part of my plan. I'd love to hear about what others of you are 

&gt; &gt; doing -- and how you are doing it. Thanks! Jill
&gt; &gt;
