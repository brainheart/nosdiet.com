Hello;

I found the nos diet and this group towards the end of Christmas 
break. Wanting to make sure nos was as doable and simple as it 
appears, I decided not to start until I had done it for three 
weeks.:-) So I've been noisily lurking here for the last three weeks.

The nos website is an example of what the internet was promised to 
be, a free exchange of ideas. And nos is one of the best ideas I've 
found. It still cracks me up - it beats or matches any popular or 
comercial diet out there, and it does so by simply putting our 
mommy's advice, &quot;Don't eat too much&quot; into a nos memory aid. It's 

genius.

I'm 48. Until a few years ago I was still a skinny type trying to get 
bigger and stronger. It worked moderately. Then I realized there 
would always be someone bigger and stronger (brilliant, huh?; I'm 
kind of slow). So, considering my age, I figured I better go for the 
health benefits and get back to my old skinniness as much as 
possible. I'm competitive; maybe I can outlive the big guys.

I tried, and still believe in and like, reasonable interpretations of 
the low-carb diets. I think most people should look into the the why 
of those diets, the insulin problem, etc. However, as I said, nos can 
match those diets very well. 

The problem I had with those other diets was other people. My wife is 
the greatest cook in the world, and it is not nice to say I won't eat 
this or must eat that - how rude. Now nobody knows I'm on a diet - 
it's invisible. If she puts freshbaked rhubbarb pie in front of me 
I'll take a small to medium slice for the sake of domestic deception 
I mean tranquility. Hey, it's much less than my former huge slice and 
then a second. Nos is a good thing - make it work.

The first week was easiest. It was so nice to not eat so much, to be 
hungry at mealtime. I noticed I was on a diet a little more the 
second and third week. It was no big thing. My meals were big enough 
that they held me through from one meal to the other. 

After three weeks, I lost three, two, or maybe one pound. I don't 
care. I agree with the advice to not look at a scale. I do - I'm 
compulsive. I don't care. 

I am eating less than I used to. I'm not wasting my time around the 
house grazing. A reason I didn't lose much even though my calories 
are so much less is I think the body likes to keep it's same weight 
for a while. It's just a feeling I have. Weight will come off when it 
comes off.

I know I am saving money. I must be. No more money goes to almonds 
and apples in the drawer, a rare candy bar, whatever. Since the diet 
is invisible, it may take a little more time to be reflected in the 
family grocery bill.

I always work out to some extent or another. My first link to the nos 
site was from shovelglove.com. That's another work of laughingly 
simple genius. I don't do those particular (peculiar?) exercises 
because I'm shoveling and pounding tire retaining walls with a 
sledgehammer anyway. Other exercises are more fun for me right now. I 
found an exercise site with a specially made sledgehammer just for 
exercising. Ha! Poor suckers. The customers probably by Atkins energy 
bars.

There has to be a downside to nos. Here it is: the name is a Spanish 
reflexive pronoun. Oh well.

Hello nosers. Make it work.

Tom
