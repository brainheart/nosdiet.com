<pre>
    
I made it through the first full week pretty good.
Last weekend i was new so i did not give myself the S day slack. been 
on plan for 11 days now.

Sweets were not had ( well i sampled a new product at work.. but it 
wa a bite.. not a serving)
No second helpings
No snacks were had


it is that simple


I did have to adjust my meals because i swung shift two times this 
week.. my body did not know if it were coming or going.. so a few of 
the days i had three smaller meals and one big one. Being awake for 
20 hours a time some days and only awake for 12 on others makes for 
strange eating habits.

The strange thing is.. for both my s days.. i picked sweets for my S 
thing allowed.. which is unsual for me

I had a bounty bar saturday and a small bowl of ice cream sunday.
have not had a meal yet today either but have had icecream( wellthe 
icecream was breakfast) getting ready for my lunch.. ( which is my 
families dinner.. midnights blows...)
I am not going to weigh myself for another week yet.

Even though i am averaging over 8000 steps walked at work.. I am 
still trying to incorporate more walking into my day.
Walking to work is not really an option as I could not manage towalk 
home again after standing on my feet for 8 hours. I walk around my 
block a few times a night until my feet can't take anymore.

Days off will be the clincher , go to the highschool and do the track 
until i just can't walk anymore.( or the pedometer hits 4000 steps.. 
whichever comes first)
