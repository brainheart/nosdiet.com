Hi Everyone, I am very frustrated. I really fell of the wagon. I 
am at my top weight again. It started last week when my cousin gave 
me the South Beach Diet book. I tried it for a day, then I thought I 
would just cut down which included snacking and then all hell broke 
loose. I came back to check the posts and had 25 and read them all. 
It seems some of us keep making the same mistakes. It seems when I 
have success that is really when I fall??? Is it because my body has 
lost some weight and it is trying to get it back? I guess I have 
been trying for about 3 months now and I should have done better. I 
have continue my exercising. I really look forward to that so that 
is good but I feel like a food junkie. Well enough of the whining.

I kind of have a goal. We are going to Key West the end of July and 
I wish I had done better these past 3 months but I guess I can't go 
back so I have to let it go. I know what I am suppose to do I am 
going to try real hard to do it.

Thanks for listening.
