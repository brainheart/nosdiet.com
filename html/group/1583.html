Hey Rondelle, How are you honey? :) Did you pack up the icecream at 
the video store yet? LOL
Not to be *too* facetious, and of course thanks for the newsletter, 
but one day some doctor is going to say that eating an APPLE will 
cause cancer...I can't help but laugh at the unbelievably 
microscopic evaluations these guys use in their approach, but 
unfortunately they are not factoring in the whole person, complete 
with emotions, mental baggage, stress, (NoS reference alert) bad 
*habits* which never change, spiritual &quot;ruts&quot; and other intangeable 

attributes...A major pathology cannot simply be caused by one thing, 
some poisonous food. An example of how much more complex this issue 
really is, comes from the world of cigarettes. Please don't 
misunderstand me. I am not trying to say I approve of smoking at 
all, but how can Western science explain why some people who smoke 
get cancer and why some don't? Western medicine is very good at 
doing things like fixing broken bones, doing open heart surgery, but 
I feel it is unfortunately geared towards &quot;cleanup&quot; or &quot;crisis 

control&quot; and really bad at seeing the whole picture.

Of course, I would not knowingly ingest a proven toxin, but I am not 
going to worry about getting cancer from any one food 
source...There's much more at play which is not even considered in 
these inflammatory articles. Not your article, specifically, but I 
am just so jaded at this point at what is offered as sound medical 
advice these days. I am really cynical, especially when they 
say &quot;Blah blah blah...is believed to cause cancer. What about the 

amount, the circumstances under which the food is consumed, the 
quality of the whole food experience? It's these considerations 
which most &quot;fear factor&quot; style nutritionists don't include in their 

recipe for health. 

I used to have a stepson who died at 13 from bone cancer...From the 
day he was born he lived under horrificly abusive conditions. There 
was no &quot;hereditary&quot; component to cancer in his background, he didn't 

eat that well, it's true, but it is my personal theory that having 
such a trauma filled life, and having to absorb the stress of being 
in a verbally and physically abusive family, without one day of 
peace or happiness, may have caused his pathology...It was a 
terrible shame. He was so young.

I have had my own experience with cancer, and had to have a 
dysplasia removed from my uterus years ago, and in retrospect, I 
believe that it was caused by repressed fear...I will never be able 
to &quot;prove&quot; this but I still consider it a valid possibility.

Anyway, lets just hope that some medical institution doesn't ever 
link cancer to chocolate (on S days), wanton sex, or the Grateful 
Dead, cause that would just suck! Now wouldn't it people? :)
Peace and Love,
Debbie
