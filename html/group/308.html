Hi no1space,

Regular Quaker oats should do just fine. The steel
cuts look very different. To visualize the difference,
rememeber that oats are a grain: rolled oats is the
grain squashed, steel cut is the grain coarsely
fragmented. The steel cut are a lot harder, they take
a lot longer to cook, and you couldn't possibly eat
them &quot;raw.&quot;

The brand of steel cuts that I see most often is
&quot;Mccann's Irish Oatmeal.&quot; 

<a href="http://www.mccanns.ie/pages/products.html">http://www.mccanns.ie/pages/products.html</a>

It comes in these beautiful tins that make great
storage devices. It's pricier than rolled oats, but
honestly the stuff is so dense that one tin will last
you so long, even if you eat it everyday, that there
are few foods cheaper. I'm sure you can get it cheaper
from the bulk bins too (it's just oats, after all),
but I still have a couple of tins to get through
before I investigate that. The biggest problem with it
isn't price, but the time it takes to prepare, which
is why most of the oatmeal I consume is rolled oats.

&gt; &quot;super hard core steel cut oats&quot;:
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard of these, but have never seen them in
&gt; real life. All I 
&gt; have seen in the supermarket is Quaker Oats (natural
&gt; kind, not the 
&gt; quick cook), and the various other brands (store
&gt; private labels) of 
&gt; essentially the same thing. Where can one readily
&gt; find the steel cut 
&gt; variety? Do they sell them in a package or only
&gt; bulk? What do they 
&gt; look like? What's the difference? How do you cook
&gt; them? How much do 
&gt; they cost?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
