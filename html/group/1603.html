&gt; i would like to say thanks to hanna and deb for their support and 

kindness regarding my son's LD's.

Hey Donna, sounds like your family is going through quite a 
catharsis. Being a single mother is definitely scary at times, I 
try to remember that God is always nearby, waiting to help..It 
sounds like you are trying to help your son and yourself, and not in 
some state of denial. As far as the medications go (and I can only 
speak of how US medicine approaches things) this whole society is 
overmedicated, with every thing there is a pill...Allergies, Tension 
headaches, acid indigestion, chronic fatigue, depression, sexual 
dysfunction, insomnia, they all have some expensive pill to &quot;free 

the person&quot; again....As far as I'm concerned if a person does not 

get to the source which is probably found on a deep level, these 
symptom treatment regimens will only have a very limited impact on 
the overall ongoing health of that person...
It took alot of bad experiences with at least two of the above 
mentioned problems (headaches, depression, oh also allergies so 
that's three) and at least 3 different doctors and maybe 
experimentation with 3 antidepressants (all with *horrific* side 
effects) also a year of living with horrible headaches, a secondary 
symptom of living with HerpesII (thanks for the memories Clark, LOL)
popping tylenol, advil and naproxen, with NO real effect, to make me 
finally lose faith in the &quot;medication fix&quot;...When you don't really 

get to the source of your pain, nature just keeps on &quot;turning up the 

volume&quot; to listen (thanks Gary Lee, for the &quot;volume&quot; metaphor)

So I believe strongly that food exercise and alternative, or maybe a 
better term is &quot;intergrative&quot; therapies is the way to go, combined 

with family support and whatever is personally meaningful, whether 
spirituality, or just a great friend to &quot;listen&quot;...At times it feels 

like there is no other choice and one must go with the norm. After 
all it seems like everyone takes prozac now, so it must be the only 
way. I felt desperate like that 4 years ago, but for me, those 
pills only made things much worse... It's just a big a health rut, 
to be sure, because certain day to day things don't need to be 
medicated all the time, including, and especially, our psyche and 
spirit...Some people really advocate on the side of antidepressants 
and they may help to a point, but every body is different and 
ultimately, from the handful of people who I know who use these 
prescribed solutions like Zoloft or Paxil etc..., they seem to 
eventually get to a point where the effects &quot;wear off&quot; and then they 

feel they have to switch to something else...There are more holistic 
solutions available which don't run the risk of personality altering 
side effects and possible kidney and liver toxification...No the US 
medical community at large will not acknowledge the validity of some 
of these remedies and therapies but that, I believe, is just due to 
lack of knowledge and training in those areas...
Talk therapy, good start, good outlet for release and support (on 
condition that the therapist and your son have a good honest rapport)
Consider meditation as a great way to calm things down and get 
intouch with what your body needs...As a massage therapist, I can 
personally recommend getting massage as a wonderful way to &quot;cope&quot; 

with built up stress and depression.
The four &quot;pillars&quot; of health, taken from Chinese Traditional 

Medicine, as outlined by the Yellow Emperor, hundreds of years ago 
are:

Acupuncture
Herbs
Massage/Bodywork
Exercise

You may want to add some of these to your more &quot;conventional&quot; 

treatment plans. At worst case scenario, they will do no harm...
Peace and Love,
Debbie
