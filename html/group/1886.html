well that is partially true but the film also shows what our kids eat at
school that is not something they can really choose... they are served 
bad
foods rather than healthy choices. and he showed that healthy choices do 
not
cost more than the junk foods many of the schools serve..kids dont really
have the freedom to choose when they are handed a tray of food..and the 
soda
machines do not need to be there etc.. also many of our institutions have
bad food choices available and he showed how things could be different 
there
also and how different the behavior was when good foods were served rather
than junk
his point was that this is how much of America does eat..he wasn't blaming
McDonalds he as a matter of fact started out thinking it was ridiculous 
to
blame them for peoples weight. what he did was cut out the exercise and
over eat and show how quickly that destroyed his heath . as a matter of 
fact
he showed one guy who eats a big mac every single day and is perfectly
healthy. of course he doesnt eat the fries with it :)

&gt; I was reading someones post and it reminded me of all the bad press food 

&gt; has gotten when really we all just eat too much of it and dont exercise 
or

&gt; work it off. So the person in the mirror is at fault, not Mcdonalds. No 

&gt; one to blame but myself for my jelly belly. No one forced the food down 
my

&gt; throat. Its time to take responsibility for my actions.

This reminds me of a good point that is made by Gwen Shamblin (I think), 
the

one who started Weigh Down. She says the problem with diets is that they 

are all an effort to make the *food* behave, when *we're* the ones who need 

to learn how to behave. We spend so much effort and money trying to take 

the &quot;bad stuff&quot; out of foods and only end up eating more of it because it's 

not real food and our bodies know it...and usually we are *not* healthier 
as

a result of these foods that have been licked into shape. =)
