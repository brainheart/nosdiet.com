Hi everyone,

I have been browsing this group for about 5 days, gathered my 
thoughts, and decided to post everything I had for now all at the 
same time.... more efficient, right?

So in no particular order, here we go:

1. Reinhard- since you say you eat a lot of oatmeal because it's 
portable and easy, what kind of oatmeal is it? I would assume that 
it's not the &quot;instant&quot; kind (less healthy). So, I guess I wonder how 

the fully cooked type is considered portable. 

2. Do beverages count as anything? Water, tea, coffee and other no-
cal drinks, can they be consumed throughout the day without being 
considered snacks? Or must they only be consumed along with one of 
the meals?

3. Regarding the 3 meals a day concept- I get it; but- don't you 
agree there is something to be said for the 6 small meals a day plan 
since blood sugar stays level and hunger pangs are not as likely to 
occur? Does a plan like that readily fit into the nosdiet?

4. Reinhard- do you have any before/after pictures of yourself? Do 
you have any pictures showing your upper body which show the effects 
of the shovelglove exercises, and/or pics which may depict the loss 
of fat or flab?

5. If you do the shovelglove exercises, does this completely replace 
the need for doing situps/crunches on the floor? Or do situps feature 
anything extra that cannot be achieved standing up?

6. Why do you call it the shovel GLOVE? I understand the shovel part, 
but not the glove part.

7. Has anybody noticed that the nosdiet is EXACTLY the plan (less the 
s-days) followed by Jared from Subway to lose 245 lbs. ? He decided 
to eat an exact quantity of food only 3 times per day, with no snacks 
in-between ever, lots of walking, water, and outside of his meals, no 
other food crossed his lips. There was no sugar in any of his chosen 
foods, and he still had lots of BREAD everyday, contrary to the no-
carb preachers. That tells me the system is sound.
