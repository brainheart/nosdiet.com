HI Mare, NO i couldnt live like that, I thrive on peaceful living 
condition. Cant even stand it when the counters are cluttered, let 
alone screaming hitting etc..

&quot; do you really believe they changed that much in just a week.&quot;
Not really- do we change that quickly??? letting go of bad habits. 
Those kids had been in control for a long time.

&quot; Can you imagine living in that chaos???&quot;

Couldnt pay me enough to not kill them :|

This is the end of my third week on NoS diet.WOO HOO. Not sure if i 
have lost as i have no scale :)I do feel better not being restricted 
on a diet other than the obvious three SSS. I feel more in control. 
I like that i can have pasta or rice or fruit whatever i want to 
eat.I think the next step for me now that i have conquered the snack 
machine, is exercising( walking,striding,crunches etc)My DH keeps 
asking about walking with me and I am nearly done giving him 
excuses. They have been valid ones for sure(tired,very tired,chest 
muscle pull,laundry). But now I need to buck it up and get moving.I 
must say that the weeks have flown by, i couldnt imagine dong this 
for 3 weeks,have read others post about it and thought could i ever 
get there ? Well here I am now making life changing decisions for my 
health. I looked at Reinhards photos today and thought again to 
myself will I ever be described as LEAN again. I also couldnt do 
this without My support group&quot; all of you out there in Noser world&quot;

Thankfully again Julie
