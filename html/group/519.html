True what you say about it not affecting blood sugar levels and having no 
c=
=3D=0D
alories, but there is this to be taken into account. . .=20
from <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/modernfood/aspartame.html">http://www.westonaprice.org/modernfood/aspartame.html</a> 
:
Aspartame itself doesn't have any calories, but basically, one of its ingr=
=3D=0D
edients, the amino acid phenylalanine, blocks production of serotonin, a 
ne=
r=3D=0D
ve chemical that, among other activities, controls food cravings. As you 
mi=
g=3D=0D
ht well imagine, a shortage of serotonin will make your brain and body 
scre=
a=3D=0D
m for the foods that create more of this brain chemical=97and those are 
the=
hi=3D=0D
gh-calorie, carbohydrate-rich snacks that can sabotage a dieter. Obviously,=
=3D=0D
the more aspartame one ingests, the more heightened the effects. Simply 
put=
,=3D=0D
aspartame appears to muddle the brain chemistry.

Nutritionist Susan Allen, RD, CCN, at Chicago's Northwestern Center for 
Int=
=3D=0D
egrative Medicine, suspects that something additional is going on in many 
o=
f=3D=0D
her patients who have been using aspartame and other artificial sweeteners=
.=3D=0D
Allen believes that when they consume them, the sweet taste of no-calorie 
=
s=3D=0D
weeteners triggers their bodies to release insulin, even though there is 
no=
=3D=0D
food to feed the cells. Normally, when we eat, the sugar in that food, 
whic=
h=3D=0D
is derived from carbohydrates, is broken down into simple sugars, like 
glu=
c=3D=0D
ose, which then enter the blood stream (we call it &quot;blood sugar&quot;).

We depend on insulin (secreted by the pancreas) to usher that blood sugar 
i=
=3D=0D
nto our cells to supply energy and maintain normal blood sugar levels. The 
=
p=3D=0D
roblem Allen sees is that an &quot;insulin-sensitive&quot; person who uses 
artificial=
=3D=0D
sweeteners teases his or her body into thinking food is on its way, so 
insu=
l=3D=0D
in is released. But when the body discovers it was cheated out of food, it 
=
r=3D=0D
evolts by throwing a food-craving tantrum that can only be quelled by eatin=
g=3D=0D
blood sugar food that will more than likely be high-calorie sugary snacks.=
=3D=0D
&quot;I point out to them how it doesn't make sense. . . they're trying to save

t=3D=0D
hemselves sugar but then they eat more foods that are going to raise their 
=
b=3D=0D
lood sugar anyway.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But not much comfort if you are one of the folks who do have a bad

&gt; &gt; :( I personally think there is enough questionable data about it that 
i=

t is
&gt; &gt; worthwhile to avoid it on a regular basis. Why stuff unneeded junk 
li=

ke

&gt;=20
&gt; Why stuff snacks, sweets or seconds into your body? Presumably if
&gt; everyone here had no problem dropping extra food cold turkey then 
we
&gt; wouldn't be here in the first place.=20
&gt;=20
&gt; Until then, some people will get to 'fewer sweets' via 'diet sweets',
&gt; and especially via 'diet soda', where you find aspartame all over 
the=20
&gt; place.
&gt;=20
&gt; It's great that you choose to avoid it yourself, and I have no problem
&gt; with that at all; going from that and &quot;some people get headaches&quot; 
to
&gt; &quot;you should avoid this outright&quot; seems a bit counterproductive. 
For=20
&gt; someone that does not have reactions to aspartame -- and since most
&gt; people do not there is a high probability that the person you were
&gt; advising to avoid it does not -- it is advice that will make it more
&gt; difficult for them to change their eating patterns.
&gt;=20
&gt; In short, the dangers of aspartame are urban legend.
&gt;=20
&gt; The British medical journal The Lancet published an opinion on aspartame
&gt; and internet pseudoscience, in which the authors wrote
&gt;=20
&gt; Patients at our diabetes clinic have raised concerns about information=
=3D=0D

&gt; on the internet about a link between the artificial sweetener
&gt; aspartame and various diseases. Our research revealed over 6000 web
&gt; sites that mention aspartame, with many hundreds alleging aspartame 
to=
=3D=0D

&gt; be the cause of multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosis, Gulf War
&gt; Syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, brain tumours, and diabetes
&gt; mellitus, among many others. Virtually all of the information offered
&gt; is anecdotal, from anonymous sources and is scientifically
&gt; implausible.
&gt;=20
&gt; An MIT study (press release at
&gt; <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/tt/1998/sep16/aspartame.html">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/tt/1998/sep16/aspartame.html</a>) 
found
&gt; no adverse health effects from daily large doses of aspartame:
&gt;=20=20=20=20
&gt; During a four-month period, subjects received either aspartame, sugar
&gt; or a placebo and underwent physical and psychological testing. Some
&gt; subjects were given doses of up to 45 milligrams per kilogram of body
&gt; weight--the equivalent of 17 to 24 12-ounce diet beverages for males
&gt; and 14 to 19 12-ounce drinks for females. In the general population,
&gt; most Americans who consume aspartame take in 3 milligrams per
&gt; kilogram of body weight a day, the equivalent of one or less 12-ounce
&gt; diet beverage.
&gt;=20=20=20=20
&gt; Despite the high consumption of aspartame, the 48 normal subjects
&gt; showed no changes in mood, memory, behavior, electroencephalograms
&gt; (which record the electrical signals of the brain) or physiology that
&gt; could be tied to aspartame, Dr. Spiers found. Although some subjects
&gt; reported headaches, fatigue, nausea and acne, the same number of
&gt; incidences were reported by subjects taking placebo and sugar as
&gt; those taking aspartame.
&gt;=20=20=20=20
&gt; The US Food and Drug Administration has weighed in as well
&gt; (from <a href="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/qa-adf9.html">http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/qa-adf9.html</a>):
&gt;=20
&gt; To date, FDA has not determined any consistent pattern of symptoms 
tha=
=3D=0D
t
&gt; can be attributed to the use of aspartame, nor is the agency aware 
of
&gt; any recent studies that clearly show safety problems.
&gt;=20
&gt; Lastly, the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard University talks about
&gt; aspartame and diabetes
&gt; (<a href="http://www.joslin.harvard.edu/education/library/aspartame.shtml">http://www.joslin.harvard.edu/education/library/aspartame.shtml</a>):
&gt;=20
&gt; Since [aspartame] does not contain calories in the usual amounts
&gt; consumed, it cannot affect blood sugar levels or cause weight gain.
&gt;=20
&gt; If your doctor has told you that your hyperglycemia is a result of
&gt; consuming aspartame I recommend that you find someone else to help 
you
&gt; manage your condition.=20
&gt;=20
&gt; (I should add that individuals with the genetic condition=20
&gt; phenylketonuria are unable to metabolize some of the components in
&gt; aspartame, but phenylketonuria is rare, and the components that PKU
&gt; individuals cannot metabolize are present in other foods.)
&gt;=20
&gt; Generally, then, I think aspartame is a reasonable way to improve 
from
&gt; being a regular soda drinker; while ideally we'd all just go to water 
or
&gt; tea right away, some are going to have to take smaller steps, and 
diet
&gt; soda with aspartame, being readily available all over the world, is 
a
&gt; safe smaller step.
&gt;=20
&gt; Lastly, I am not a doctor, and none of the above should be considered
&gt; medical advice.
&gt;=20
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;=20
