Welcome back Valerie. Hang in there. 

I almost slipped yesterday. I got terribly hungry and wanted to 
start grabbing at 3:00 PM and I couldn't think it away. It was 
getting real bad. So I decided I had to give in and just had my 
dinner very early and I really filled my plate. I figured this was 
better that grabbing something and start the cycle of non stop 
eating. Well I lasted through the night so I did only have 3 
meals. Whew!!! Today I feel better. It is weird how that 
happens. The only thing I can think of is I came home early and 
maybe that change in my schedule gave me some free time.

Something I have when I need a sweet; I make a cup of coffee with 
coffeemate and 1 equal and then I add it to ice and have a large 
cold coffee drink. It taste good to me and seems to help. Not the 
healthiest but serves the purpose.

Are Italian greyhounds more stubborn than a Jack Russell terrier? I 
can't imagine. I have one of those and 2 mixed breeds. And a cat. 
Love them all.

Take care everyone.
