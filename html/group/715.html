<pre>
    
I've been doing no-s for 6 weeks now and clearly need some help. 
First, some vital stats: I'm 50 years old, 5'1&quot;, about 110 pounds 

(yes, I know the insurance charts say that's normal), I exercise 3-4 
days a week with either toning floor exercises and/or &quot;gliding&quot; or 

jumping on the trampoline. I work in an office for attorneys so I 
sit on my tush most of the day. At the end of the first two weeks, 
I was thrilled to see I had lost 1/2&quot;, but nothing more since then. 

I have no idea if I've lost any pounds because I don't have any 
scales. While I realize my situation is not desperate, I'm tired of 
looking like I'm 6 months pregnant. Obviously, the weight I want to 
lose is right in the tummy. I live on a lake and I don't want to 
feel embarrassed about the way I look when swimsuit season rolls 
around.

One of the reasons I joined no-s was because I wasn't given a strict 
list of foods to eat, or not to eat. So I continue to eat the same 
foods as before: toast or cereal for quick breakfast, a sandwich or 
hamburger for lunch (I have cut out the chips/fries except for s 
days), and dinner seems to be whatever hubby and I agree on...often 
grilled something with a salad or baked potato or beans...we eat 
very simply at home. With spring finally having arrived in Texas, I 
hit the ground running on the weekends. My s days generally go with 
only two meals a day, the good news is that leaves some calories 
available for sweets! Confession: I often have a &quot;light&quot; beer in 

the evenings and one or two granola bars a day; other than that I 
believe I've been pretty faithful to no-s.

Any ideas on getting more inches off?

Gwen
