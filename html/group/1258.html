Welcome, Ann.

As Rich pointed out, No-s is designed for maintenance,
which is totally neglected by most other systems, but
is actually the really tricky part, and what it sounds
like is mostly what you have to do. Massive loss in
short time makes the best copy (&quot;x pounds in y weeks,
belly fat first!&quot;), but it doesn't make the best life.

As I mention on the shovelglove site:

&quot;Maintenance is harder than progress. Maintenance is
more necessary than progress. Progress is
intrinsically temporary and you need to mentally
budget for that fact.&quot;

Best of luck, and keep us posted.

Reinhard

P.S. I know I've got a bit of a welcome backlog at the
moment. More pending... can only squeeze in time for
one at a go right now. In the meantime, a general
welcome to all recent arrivals.

&gt; I don't remember the link that got me to the No S
&gt; diet, but what a find. After a weight loss 
&gt; of 85 with WW, attending meetings and following the
&gt; point program I switched to a local 
&gt; program started by a former WW leader. I followed
&gt; along with more counting; energy units 
&gt; instead of points but the same thing. I found myself
&gt; rebeling against the counting, writing 
&gt; and a program designed for people constantly coming
&gt; into the program rather than 
&gt; someone with a large amount of weight to lose. I
&gt; found myself gaining on vacations and 
&gt; finally gaining 19 pounds back over 2 years. Now I
&gt; have been playing with the same 5 
&gt; pounds for almost a year. 
&gt; 
&gt; This makes so much sense. I can eat right for 5 days
&gt; a week with some variation on S 
&gt; days. It does not mean I can go hog wild because I
&gt; can gain as easy as I lose. So far so 
&gt; good.
