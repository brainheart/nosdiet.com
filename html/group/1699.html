Hi gang (or club for you pacifists out there :)
I took a measurement of my waist back on September 3rd, also my 
belly at bellybutton level (where I most resemble a kangaroo)
I thought that rather than pounds I would find this a more 
motivating reality check for me, as pounds can really fluctuate up 
and down sometimes as much as 5 lbs, just from a few salty meals or 
indiscretions. In addition pms and menstruation usually rocks my 
world poundwise...And this week is no exception from that pattern.
I am actually up around 4 or maybe 5 lbs, but I know that I have 
also been exercising alot more regularly...SG at least 4 days out of 
5, massaging people for several hours a week.
So even though I was a bit miffed at that predictable gain during 
the most bitchiest time of the month when I am definitely &quot;bloated&quot;
I decided to check my waistline, because my clothes didn't seem 
tighter...
The results:
I am down an extra 1/2 an inch from about 3 weeks ago, and a total 
of 1 and 1/2 inches since Sept 3! Pretty nice :) Maybe this 
Shovelglove stuff is making the difference, it seems so.
Richard, my son, who has been his usual active, eight year old self, 
has lost 1 and 1/4 inches of fat from his cutie belly, from being on 
No S with me :) He is strutting around like Mick Jagger because he 
is proud that you can now start to see his Abs!
So besides slashing out days, I strongly recommend to all, to 
consider measuring yourselves as a kinder gentler alternative to 
scale hopping.
Peace and God Bless :)
Debbie
