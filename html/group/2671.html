Sorry to hear that you had a slip up, Debbie. Here's a big hug! It 
sounds like you were able to see the silver lining in the cloud, 
though. Having that overfull feeling fresh in your memory may help 
you stay on track for awhile. Try not to beat yourself up too much. 
Today is another day. Your slip-up wasn't that serious. After all, 
at least you didn't deliberately go into the kitchen, pull out a big 
bag of chips or Hershey's kisses, and devour the whole thing in 
addition to your regular dinner. So, all in all, I think you did 
well! This is a process, right? Occasional slip-ups are part of the 
process.

I'm continuing to learn as I go. Overall, I'm very proud of myself. 
No chocolate since last Sunday! However, yesterday I broke down and 
had a snack before bedtime. I was so hungry because I hadn't eaten a 
sensible dinner. (All I had was a bowl of ramen noodle soup.) It 
made me realize that I really need to make an effort to plan 
nutritious, high-quality meals, and making sure each meal includes a 
serving of protein probably wouldn't be a bad idea, either.

Have a great day,
Nancy
