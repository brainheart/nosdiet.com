In Response to the statement that the American system
of healthcare is uncivilized -- to an extent that is
true, however there are no people dying on the street
in agony either. And yes, I have ben treated in the
emergency room that also contained everyone from
vagrants to wealthy people. Emergency rooms do not
refuse care in critical situations as the hypocratic
oath would not allow such behavior from a doctor.Most
towns and cities of any size have paramedics supported
by the local and state governments that provide first
responder care that is world class. Smaller localities
are staffed with volunteers who must be completely
trained and certified by a government agency. Yes,
there are doctors that are in medicine almost solely
for money, but they are usually plastic surgeons who
make a living off the insercurities of people who want
fat sucked away or vain women wanting their boobs
enlarged. The American system of healthcare has
virtually been crippled by lawyers(baristers?) who sue
for and win outrageous sums of money and drive
malpratice insurance up for doctors (who pass the
costs on to patients). Medicaid is given to all of the
the poor which ensures them of medical treatment that
often is the best in the world and costs taxpayers
(who pay their own medical bills) through the
nose.Health insurance companies are staffed with
demons from hell who will withhold payment on anything
they do not approve of. Yes healthcare is fouled up in
this country,but the only thing that could possibly
screw it up worse s the US government. We have
government agencies that will pay $500 dollars (about
330 pounds sterling) for a hammer that can be had for
$10 at at the local hardware store. Congress cannot
account for over 300 billion dollars of the country's
budget from last year. I don't think anyone would want
those guys in charge of healthcare.
The big difference in the European and (less and less)
the American mindset about government is that we have
a basic mistrust of governments that become too
powerful.
Ben Franklin,the classic American sage of the
Revolution, said that those who would trade securty
for freedom deserve neither.From the start of the
American Revolution until now we have bitched and
complained about government - ours and others and have
looked at politicians with a critical eye. I suppose
someone has to.
