Hi dangalishus,

First off, give yourself some credit, it sounds like
you've licked 2 out of three esses. That's a good in
itself, and a foundation on which to build. You are in
better shape to tackle the final S than you were
before.

My advice is: 

1) get the cheese nips etc. out of the house. If you
want to indulge on s-days, buy a small amount so you
don't have leftovers to tempt you.

2) give yourself decent sized meals so you aren't so
hungry for snacks. Until you know just the right
amount it takes, it's ok to make the meals a little
too large at first. Once you have the discipline of no
snacking in place it's relatively easy to fine tune
the portions.

3) if somehow #1 and #2 don't work on any given day,
drop the crackers and nips and stick with the fruits.
It's not officially &quot;ok,&quot; rules-wise, to snack on
fruit, but it's officially &quot;much better&quot; than the
alternatives.

4) Drink more water, drink tea. Drink anything except
sugar water. It's astonishing what a difference this
can make.

5) bug us if none of this works

Hope this helps,

Reinhard

&gt; I have definitely taken the sugars away and even on
&gt; the weekends when 
&gt; I can eat a debbie cake, I don't have it and I
&gt; pretty much anything I 
&gt; want. I have stayed away from the sodas as well. 
&gt; For me not to have 
&gt; a soda is a miracle that i could not entail before,
&gt; but that is also 
&gt; doing good for me. However, the snacking has
&gt; diminshed to a point, 
&gt; but I didn't think about it a few minutes ago when I
&gt; just bought and 
&gt; ate those cheese nips, the little bag to go. My
&gt; snacks consists of 
&gt; wheat crackers and white crackers and fruit. How do
&gt; I get out of 
&gt; this mode gang. Please help. I am not having
&gt; seconds either. I 
&gt; feel like I am doing so much better, but I also feel
&gt; I am on the 
&gt; wrong band-wagon. Any adice would surely help. 
&gt; Please direct me in 
&gt; the path I should go.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
