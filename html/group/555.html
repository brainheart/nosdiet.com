Welcome, John. Not sure why it took two days for your
message to go through... hope you're still with us.
Though given your line of work and obvious
determination, I'm optimistic. These simple structures
may be all you've been missing.

Keep us posted,

Reinhard

&gt; Good morning! My name is John, and I am a pastor
&gt; and school teacher. I
&gt; think that the no-s diet is the only viable answer
&gt; to maintaining proper
&gt; body weight. A couple of years ago, I went on
&gt; WeightWatchers, and lost
&gt; about 15 pounds. At 6 feet tall and 200 pounds I am
&gt; not so very far from
&gt; my &quot;target weight&quot;. As any dieter can tell you,
&gt; those last pounds come
&gt; off hard! Unfortunately, after all my hard work, I
&gt; almost immediately
&gt; gained the 15 pounds back. :-( On WeightWatchers,
&gt; I felt like I was
&gt; starving to death all the time, and was too weak to
&gt; do very much work. I
&gt; really began to wonder what the point of being thin
&gt; and living longer
&gt; was, if I was unable to accomplish any meaningful
&gt; work in my life.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the past few months, my snacking has really
&gt; gotten out of control. 
&gt; I was eating a candy bar or M&amp;M's every day, and my
&gt; weight has ballooned
&gt; up to 212 pounds (fully dressed and with my work
&gt; boots on). This weight
&gt; gain has got to stop!
&gt; 
&gt; I have been on the No-S plan since the beginning of
&gt; the month, and it has
&gt; not been too hard so far. I am kind of a determined
&gt; person, and it seems
&gt; like I may eventually get my body in the habit of
&gt; eating less. I think I
&gt; may stick strictly to the plan, and then weigh
&gt; myself at the end of the
&gt; month.
&gt; 
&gt; At any rate, I hope you all have a wonderful week,
&gt; and I am looking
&gt; forward to working with you all.
&gt; 
&gt; John
