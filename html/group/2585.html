Deb,



I found out about this diet from the T-Tapp website too, and have been
&quot;tapping&quot; off and on for 4 years. It's good for strengthening the 
core
muscles in the torso, and the ab workout is great, but I think it's a little
over sold on the web site - not to mention the expense of the tapes.



Maybe all fitness web sites do this, but when they say someone lost X number
of inches, I tend to think of that as a combo of waist, hips, thighs, chest
&amp; arms. What they actually do is make several measurements up your 
arms,
legs and torso and then combine all the &quot;lost inches&quot; from way more 
spots
than any normal person would consider measuring. Like I said, maybe it's
commonly done, but it seems a little dishonest to me.



The other thing is the mega-extreme emphasis on form. Your starting
position (before you do any of the exercises) is this:



1.	Legs hip width apart
2.	Knees bent
3.	Knees twisted out (from the hip) so they are over your little toes
4.	Butt tucked under - way under
5.	Abdominals tight
6.	Shoulders back and down (not pushed down with your traps, but pulled
down and together with your lats)
7.	Chest out
8.	Arms relaxed by your sides with palms forward.



After that it gets complicated, and any failure to lose has the trainers
immediately attributing it to your not having done one of the above
perfectly.



I've found that it's great for improving balance, and I use it for that, 
but
for fat burning, nothing beats the old treadmill/exercise bike combo for 
me.



Sharon

Hi Deb, 
If T-Tapp (Teresa Tapp) is done correctly, I don't think that you 
would ever &quot;Out Grow&quot; the benefits of this exercise program. Teresa 

has a very long list of credentials and a lot of work in the progress 
of this program. Is it for everyone, probably not, worth 
investigating, it's up to the individual. Take a look, it's a lot 
harder than one might think at first glance, and about the time you 
think you've got it, it gets harder. Nothing against your trainer, 
but that's usually the response from someone that hasn't tried it. 
Okay, so back to the NoS subect, how long have you been on this WOE 
and what type of results have you had. 
I noticed last night that after preparing heaping plate and couldn't 
finish the whole thing, maybe there's hope for me. I haven't felt 
guilty about anything that I've eaten either. Yea.
Bye for now.
Joyce

&gt; ....Hi Oldies :)
&gt; I will check out your TTap site... From what I understand, 
according 
&gt; to my muscle bound personal trainer who is definitely a very big 
guy,
&gt; isometric movements won't do much for the muscles because you have 

&gt; to work the muscle to the full extent of its range of motion...yes 

&gt; you will develop some endurance and burn some calories to be sure, 

&gt; but to really see results and improve your muscles you have to do, 

&gt; what he called, &quot;progressive overload&quot;... ie, if you don't continue 

&gt; to challenge the muscle, your results won't be optimal.
&gt; But do what you like, because that is a very important factor, and 

&gt; it is usually the deciding factor on whether or not you continue 
any 
&gt; exercise regimen :)
&gt; Hope NoS is going well for you
&gt; Deb
