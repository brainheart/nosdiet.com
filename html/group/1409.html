Thanks Jennifer (and others who replied!) for the good ideas. I ended
up taking the idea of taking the food home and keeping it until an
S-day. I tried this last week with a piece of birthday pie, and it
worked well. About the only thing I couldn't do that with might be
doughnuts... maybe I'll cut myself a little slack for doughnuts
celebrating promotions, but for any other doughnuts I'll just pass.

Jen, keep it up, you'll probably be fine. I've found doing productive
things, such as exercise, helping friends/parents with home repairs
(hey, anyone can paint), stuff like that is a good way of keeping your
mind off of food, and getting some fitness too. And it makes the S
days so much more rewarding when you've been &quot;good&quot; the rest of 
the
week. But then again, you have 30 years of habits to overcome...
heck, I only have 28. ;-)

--- In , &quot;Jennifer Dunbabin&quot; &gt; lbs.
&gt; that is great news for a newbie like me to hear.
&gt; 
&gt; the best thing for food u don't want to eat is to LIE, lol, and say 
'no
&gt; thanks, that's not my thing' or 'I'm allergic to X, I will come out 
in
&gt; hives'. that deals with the manners side of things.
&gt; 
&gt; the temptation bit ...... well, that is a bit harder. drink lots of
water
&gt; and herb teas. my temptation happens in the evening and I still
haven't got
&gt; a handle on it.
&gt; 
&gt; for me it is finding replacement stuff to do I think that makes me 
feel
&gt; loved and nurtured. good things like meditation, painting flowers,
singing,
&gt; writing and talking to friends .... I am making small steps but it
is going
&gt; to take a long time. I have 30 yrs of habits to overcome.
&gt; 
&gt; keep us informed about how your progress goes.
&gt; 
&gt; love
&gt; 
&gt; jen
