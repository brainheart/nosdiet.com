&gt; HI Cat, Way to go girl. Isnt there a sense of impowerment to not 
let it rule you,your emotions etc..I agree with deb- lets add 
another S to the diet. NO scales just slashes :) Come on Reinhard do 
it, your the master of this site only you can make the change for 
all of us,just 2 words &quot; NO SCALES&quot;. If he wont do it lets start a 

petition :) Yes i am still feeling bitchy today, and if I need to 
blame it on someone I think you are a good choice Debster.After all 
what are friends for. If its too much for you,you can OHMMMMM it

&gt; &gt; i have been thinking lately that i do let the scale and my diet 

&gt; take too much of my life so i will concentrate on making healthy 
&gt; choices and just see where i go 
&gt; ....I bet you will surprise yourself, and do great!
&gt; I had a successful first red slash day, on the calendar. 
&gt; It feels very good to take the initiative to change myself for the 

&gt; better...Why be passive about something as important as my 
personal 
&gt; success? I'm enjoying all the posts and stories from everyone, 
and 
&gt; wish you all the best.
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard, I looked at that Sheldrake guys site, it was 
&gt; interesting...*I* think by supporting each other towards 
&gt; a &quot;collective goal&quot;, ie: getting serious about sticking with NoS, 

we 
&gt; will be able to shape our habits in our &quot;collective group 
&gt; consciousness&quot;... It will be that much easier...
&gt; All actions we take as individuals effect all humanity, because we 

&gt; are all part of the Universe, and you can't change one part of the 

&gt; Universe without it's directly impacting the Whole.
&gt; I feel like the NoS group, and it's cousin sites, SG, UR and 
&gt; Everyday, are wonderful microcosmic examples of the application of 

&gt; these Karmic Universal laws....
&gt; Ommmmmmmmmm-my goodness I am only 48 hours away from a Haagen Daz 

&gt; attack! :)
&gt; Cosmically Yours,
&gt; Deb
