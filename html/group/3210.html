&gt; McDonalds I bought a roast chicken wrap with salad and a pack of 
fruits. It didn't cause my blood sugar to go up too high and I was 
satisfied and didn't get into trouble. We all have free will and what 
we eat is our choice not the vendor's.

....You are right! There's always a healthy option if one wants it.
Way to go Hana :)
I forget if you have type II or juvenille diabetes, but I will tell 
you that if it's type II, you can pretty much reverse it completely 
simply by getting the weight down...
Keep up the great work :) You can beat that disease Hana! You are on 
your way :)
I had gestational diabetes with Richard, which could explain why he 
was eleven pounds! At the time, I already was grossly obese for my 
height, before I got pregnant... It was my high weight that tripped 
the diabetes off, but with the hospital &quot;diabetes diet&quot; which in 

essence was like NOS, ie: no refined sugar, and not huge amounts, I 
thankfully didn't have to use insulin... My cholesterol also dropped 
about 100 points once I was back in NY for a year and not eating for 
three, like I did when in New Orleans, a town *not* known for it's 
lean cuisine :)
As for McDonalds offering healthier choices, I am also happy to see 
that this is a growing trend in fast food joints of all types...
I know that the vendor isn't the one to make our choices, but in the 
end, most people, when you say McDonalds, won't have a yogurt side and 

chicken salad pop into their mind..
It's gonna be a big clown with red shoes and hair, and the hamburgler, 

and the very greasy, heart clogging classic
The Big Mac ;)
(and when they say I'm having a &quot;Big Mac Attack&quot;, they really mean it! 

LOL)
Love,
Deb
