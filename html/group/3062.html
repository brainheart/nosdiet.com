Thanks for the imput. I know now a days that being fit is very
feminine and sexy for a woman. . I just want the slim toned look (
like Reinhard's). I DON'T want to look like the female version of
Schwarzenegger. :) Thanks for the response and a sledge hammer will be
purached Wednesday (hopefully!). 
P.S. My back isn't as great as it could be. Any precautionary measures
other than don't over-do it?

&gt; &gt; Hi! Sorry it's been so long since I've posted. It's been really 

&gt; hectic. I have a question about the shovel glove and its effect on a 

&gt; woman's body. 
&gt; .... You can expect to sweat and feel envigorated, also you will 
&gt; develop a &quot;fearsome grip&quot; :)
&gt; 
&gt; I like the results of the shovel glove. . .however, I want to trim 

&gt; down, not bulk up. Will it make a woman bulk up? Do any of you gals 

&gt; in the group shovel glove? Thanks in advance for any replies.

&gt; .....Hi Amy :)
&gt; Everyone is really unique, but as for me.. My arms have slimmed down 

&gt; nearly 2 inches and I certainly don't look any bulkier...
&gt; If you pardon my honest and frankness here, I really think the 
&gt; whole &quot;bulking up&quot; issue is fairly mythical and unfounded...
&gt; I'm not a personal trainer, but I will go a bit out on a limb to say 

&gt; it is my belief that you would have to really really really be 
&gt; lifting a very large amount of weight to increase your muscle mass 

&gt; to the point that you start to look &quot;bulky&quot;... More probably, you 

&gt; will just develop strength, tone and definition.... Take a good look 

&gt; at Reinhards pic... He just looks chiseled not like Goliath... 
&gt; Strong toned and lovely to look at!
&gt; Don't you think that would be a good thing to aspire to?
&gt; Just don't start popping roids and you should be fine :)
&gt; Being in shape is feminine Amy, so don't let others tell you it's 

&gt; not.
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
