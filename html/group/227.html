Hi Joy,

As Kevin points out, fruit isn't just permitted, it's
officially encouraged, and as the sweetest thing
you'll eat during the week, you'll come to appreciate
it as you never have before. I would encourage you, as
Kevin suggests, to associate fruit *with* your meals,
instead of eating it in between, just so you don't
start compensating for all that good fruit with lousy
meals. You don't have to wolf it down all at once, but
make sure that when you're designing your &quot;first,&quot; you
make room for the fruit. If the mass of food of on
that plate gives you pause, you should at least force
yourself to appreciate the fact. Fruit is twice as
good when it takes the place of something bad.

Reinhard

P.S. Congratulations, Kevin. I'm happy to hear it's
working out for you.

&gt; To answer a few of your questions from my point of
&gt; view, fruit is the 
&gt; greatest thing for this diet. I eat an apple with
&gt; every breakfast, they 
&gt; supposedly give you as much energy as a cup of
&gt; coffee (and are much better 
&gt; for you). I often times have a &quot;dessert&quot; of grapes
&gt; or strawberries, a small 
&gt; portion that I eat at the end of the meal, though I
&gt; keep these as a part of 
&gt; the proverbial plate. 
&gt; I'm what you called a carb addict. All I eat is
&gt; pizza, pasta, bread, and 
&gt; chili it seems. With pasta and bread being the
&gt; biggest. Toast for breakfast 
&gt; and lunch, pasta for dinner. Yet with this diet,
&gt; it's okay, and I'm proof 
&gt; now. I've only lost a few pounds, but the other day
&gt; I realized something: 
&gt; the pants I bought this fall, cause I couldn't fit
&gt; well into my old pants, I 
&gt; can pull down without unbuttoning/zipping. I was
&gt; quite excited about this. 
&gt; I don't know how the weight itself stays on, but the
&gt; fat, it's going away. 
&gt; 
&gt; As for other updates on me, I feared thanksgiving,
&gt; yet when it came around, I 
&gt; found I only had 1.5 plates (and the half was just
&gt; corn, I love corn). I 
&gt; didn't want anymore, I was so proud of myself. Also
&gt; Saturday night I went to 
&gt; Culvers (the only place in a large radius that
&gt; offers custard) for dinner. 
&gt; After dinner, we had assumed we would get some
&gt; custard, yet afterwards, I had 
&gt; NO desire for some. It was great. 
&gt; 
&gt; Enough about me, welcome Joy, hope you find yourself
&gt; as happy here as I am.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi all! I am a 50 yr old lady, and I'm 5'2&quot; and
&gt; weigh 143 lbs as of 
&gt; &gt; this morning. I've already lost around 10 lbs
&gt; over the last several 
&gt; &gt; months mainly by trying to just stop snacking and
&gt; staying away from 
&gt; &gt; sweets. I also have just started watching my food
&gt; combining....not 
&gt; &gt; eating carbs together with proteins. I've started
&gt; eating alot of 
&gt; &gt; fruit every day too, which seems to be making me
&gt; feel more 
&gt; &gt; energetic. I haven't been getting too sleepy in
&gt; the afternoons.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My dad died of arterosclerosis and cardiac heart
&gt; disease when he was 
&gt; &gt; 67 yrs. old. My mom has high blood pressure, my
&gt; brother died last 
&gt; &gt; year of colon cancer, and three of my sisters (mom
&gt; had eight kids) 
&gt; &gt; have had breast cancer. So....I think I need to
&gt; do my best to get 
&gt; &gt; as healthy as I can while I'm still pretty young. 
&gt; Most people think 
&gt; &gt; I'm 35 by my appearance, but I already have eight
&gt; grandchildren. :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I saw your webpage and decided to join and
&gt; try out this 
&gt; &gt; eating plan as well in addition to my food
&gt; combining and fruit 
&gt; &gt; eating. :) Worth a try, right? But I am sure I
&gt; will have to be 
&gt; &gt; extra careful on the &quot;S&quot; days because I have a
&gt; problem with trigger 
&gt; &gt; foods like pasta, bread, potatoes, and rice. 
&gt; Anyone else here a 
&gt; &gt; carb addict?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I went on the grapefruit diet, which is a high
&gt; protein/low carb diet 
&gt; &gt; that you stay on for 12 days and then go off of it
&gt; for two days. So 
&gt; &gt; every other weekend you can eat what you like. 
&gt; That was pretty good 
&gt; &gt; for me, and I lost around 20 lbs. That was 5 yrs
&gt; ago, and I ended 
&gt; &gt; up over the years putting back on most of the
&gt; weight. So I tried 
&gt; &gt; the diet again, but couldn't stick with it too
&gt; well. So I'm food 
&gt; &gt; combining now, and feeling much healthier...no
&gt; more digestive upsets.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are you allowed to eat fruit on this diet on non-S
&gt; days? I usually 
&gt; &gt; eat nothing but fruit till lunch time. Breakfast
&gt; and mid-morning 
&gt; &gt; snack are fruits. And then I have another fruit
&gt; for my afternoon 
&gt; &gt; snack.
