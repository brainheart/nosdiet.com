&gt; HI Michael, What I personally do is just say &quot; they look great but 

i am just not hungry&quot; or Sorry, but i am saving room for lunch, or I 

am cutting out snacking between meals. All plain and simple, all 
very true !No one can make you eat. It does take practice, I 
personally have a MIL who loves to feed us and often brings food 
into our place of business, never healthy, alwasys sweet and always 
delish ! I usually just tell her i am full and pass. Of course she 
knows i am trying to eat healthier and diesnt force the issue,( just 
tries to sabotage me LOL) so hang in there, practice refusing food 
if you have to at home alone. Good luck today Julie

&gt; Yesterday, I was at work for a short while and a co-worker (Walter)
&gt; offered me two bite-size sandwiches that his wife had made for a
&gt; function at her work. They were really small, about one square inch
&gt; each, and very good. One was a carrot-curry spread on white bread 

and
&gt; the other was cashew butter and some kind of jelly on wheat bread. 

I
&gt; took them, and ate them, rather than trying to explain no-s.
&gt; 
&gt; I feel awful, because not only did I have a snack, but one of them 

was
&gt; a sweet. And I did it just because I was too lazy to explain my
&gt; current mindset and eating habits. How do you guys refuse things
&gt; offered to you in the course of a normal day?
&gt; 
&gt; I've not been keeping an actual calendar with slash marks (like 
I've
&gt; heard you guys writing about) but I don't have a good mark for
&gt; yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise, things are going well.
&gt; 
&gt; Michael
