Oh, of course I agree that children are a different story entirely. I weep when I see 
what they are fed! If you start out right, then continue putting only healthy food 
before a child, they will acquire a taste for good food. I hate being around children 
who have always only eaten junk and turn up their noses at healthy food.

The funny thing is that some of the same adults who feed their children garbage will 
tie themselves into knots worrying about every ingredient or every latest health 
scare reported in the news. I think that's silly and counterproductive. That is 
&quot;trying to make the food behave.&quot; I don't know how to globally address the 
problem with school food, but occasionally a particular school decides to be 
different--they seem to have a certain amount of freedom to make changes. Then you 
hear reports about grades going up and everyone being happier and getting along 
better (as you say). It's that evil sugar, IMHO!

well that is partially true but the film also shows what our kids eat at
school that is not something they can really choose... they are served 
bad
foods rather than healthy choices. and he showed that healthy choices do 
not
cost more than the junk foods many of the schools serve..kids dont really
have the freedom to choose when they are handed a tray of food..and the 
soda
machines do not need to be there etc.. also many of our institutions have
bad food choices available and he showed how things could be different 
there
also and how different the behavior was when good foods were served rather
than junk
