As planned, I overate on Thanksgivings. No regrets, it
was great. If you did the same, great, don't worry
about it. That's the time for it.

But I notice that some of you seem to have a very
liberal concept of the boundaries of thanksgivings.
It's one day. Not Wednesday, not Friday, not 10 days,
just Thursday. Leftovers? They meal up very well.
Turkey sandwiches for lunch, microwaved plates for
dinner, etc. If you still have any appetite left on
Friday, that should do the trick nicely. Sweet
leftovers? Believe it or not, they'll keep one day
till the weekend. And if the velociraptors you live
with get to it first, good riddance. The fridge can be
your friend.

I guess I should have posted this sooner to prop up
the stumbling, but I was in slow bandwidth country.

This system isn't going to work if you turn every
major holiday into a two week affair. I don't want to
pounce on the already humbled, but I don't want to
&quot;OK&quot; you into complacency either. If you messed up,
recognize it, learn from it. Don't start starving
yourself to compensate, that's a recipe for utter
disaster. Just abide by the regular N day rules, no
more, no less. 

For most of us in this group, there are two other
biggies right around the corner that need to be
prepared for, and they're close enough together that
the temptation to extend and merge will be even
stronger. Apply your Thanksgivings day lessons to
these. Give yourself these 2 days wholeheartedly, but
no more.

Best wishes and much gratitude for this great group,

Reinhard

P.S. Bad as it is, let's be thankful that our problem
is getting too much food and not the other way around.
As problems go, it's a much better problem to have. Of
the 106 billion or so people who have ever lived on
earth, precious few have been so lucky.
