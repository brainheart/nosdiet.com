Deb, in case I forget to tell you again, I think your writing style is very 

creative and entertaining! I don't often hear people say &quot;honkin&quot; and it is 

such a satisfying word. I also liked: &quot;So go to your dairy department when 

you are sad that you only lost 2 or 3 pounds and hold a huge chunk of 
cheese. Then you may find yourself saying &quot;cheese&quot; and smiling :)&quot; I 
bet 
you smiled when you thought of saying that.

I guess that the reason I hesitated to bring up a nutrition topic the other 

day is that I have learned there are so many widely varying views on all 

subjects, and it gets wearisome covering the same ground. But I, too, don't 

believe that cancer comes zooming out of nowhere for reasons too mysterious 

to understand, and that we need to expend all kinds of effort and money to 

point fingers at THIS--no THAT--and don't eat THIS--and REALLY watch out for 

THAT!! No wonder people eventually just tune it all out (by the time they 

reach 80, anyway). I don't believe anyone will ever find a cure for cancer 

because &quot;treating&quot; cancer is too profitable. And I don't think the American 

Cancer Association really wants to close down.

With all of that said, one statement I heard lately has stuck in my head: 

&quot;Cancer feeds exclusively on sugar.&quot; I have also heard that cancer cells 

form in all our bodies every day, but a healthy immune system takes care of 

them. I also know (by experience and by reading) that sugar suppresses the 

immune system. So whenever I feel a bit rebellious about giving up sweets, 

I remind myself of these facts and it puts a bit of healthy fear into me.

I have had a pretty good week so far and I feel I have made the proper 

commitment to No S this time. I have sometimes been really hungry between 

meals but I have been able to wait. I was thinking, maybe another advantage 

to this system is that it's not really &quot;NO&quot; but more like &quot;WAIT.&quot; 
Whatever 
you really want, if you just wait a bit longer, you can have it. I am 
experiencing some of that feeling of control that I tasted the first time, 

and I think it's quite a gift. Nobody will stay in prison 24 hours a day if 

you give them the key to the lock. But if there were a distinct advantage 

to staying in prison part-time, a person might have the self-discipline to 

let himself in and out at proper intervals. In my past, going on a diet 

always felt like throwing myself in prison and throwing away the key. Who 

could handle that? That's why I've refused to &quot;go on a diet&quot; for many years 

now--it ends up being counter-productive because when you break out of 

prison you always go wild.

Not that it hasn't all been said before! =)

Diane
