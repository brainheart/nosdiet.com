Hot water from the water &quot;cooler.&quot; Sounds disgusting,
but it isn't bad, and it's ridiculously convenient.
There's no cooking, no microwaving even, and nothing
to refrigerate. I just pour and by the time I've
walked back to my desk it's ready to eat. I don't use
instant oatmeal, I like it chewy.

&gt; What do you mix with that oatmeal lunch? I often do
&gt; a miture with yougart,
&gt; plain no fat with Splenda or honey, and walnuts ,
&gt; sometime cut up apple or
&gt; berries, and flavor with maple or vanilla flavoring.
&gt; It is based on the
&gt; muselix I used to eat in Switzerland.

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Intelligent defaults&quot; is a term usually used with
&gt; reference to computer programs. It means that unless
&gt; the user specifies otherwise, the program will
&gt; behave
&gt; in a reasonably smart way. It anticipates the most
&gt; common user needs and just works that way without
&gt; requiring explicit configuration. If you don't like
&gt; the way it works, you can change it, but most of the
&gt; time, you won't have to.
&gt; 
&gt; I think this is a useful concept for diet. Think up
&gt; a
&gt; convenient, reasonably healthy default meal or meal
&gt; component. Make sure to always have the ingredients
&gt; on
&gt; hand. You don't *have* to eat this stuff every day,
&gt; but it gives you a good fallback if you're in a rush
&gt; and can't think of anything better. It discourages
&gt; opportunistic, hurried bottom feeding.
&gt; 
&gt; My defaults, as I think I've mentioned before,
&gt; though
&gt; not in precisely these terms, are mestemacher whole
&gt; grain bread for breakfast, and oatmeal, dried fruit,
&gt; nuts, and seeds for lunch. The oatmeal and
&gt; mestemacher
&gt; are my &quot;carbohydrate palates.&quot; You can get a
&gt; surprising amount of variety using these as bases,
&gt; by
&gt; varying the toppings, dried fruit, etc. The lunch
&gt; components store well at work, they're easy to
&gt; always
&gt; have on hand. Again, I don't make it a *rule* to eat
&gt; this stuff every day, they're just options. But
&gt; they're options that have spared me many a trip to
&gt; the
&gt; local fast food joint. Dinner I prefer to give
&gt; serious
&gt; thought to almost every day.
&gt; 
&gt; This isn't a necessary part of the nosdiet, but I
&gt; think it's a useful complement.
