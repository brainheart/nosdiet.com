&gt; HI Deb, 

....HI Jool! :)

how about limiting the # of houses you go to this year-
&gt; less homes less candy, or weeding out the ones that arent his 
&gt; absolute favorites. face it you always get ones that arent any 
good. 

...Sounds like that Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin scenario
(&quot;What did you get?&quot;,,,&quot;I got a Rock&quot;
&gt; &gt; Good luck Julie

We discussed this last night...It was a scarier scene than Halloween!
I caved and decided to let him have around 40 mini candies, as the 
idea of 20 didn't really fare too well, LOL, to save and dole out 
over the next few months...I am really going to have to say some NOS 
mantras if that stuff is going to be around here...Maybe I'll bury 
it in the backyard and then we can dig it up every week like a 
treasure chest...*Then* we could make our *own* Diet of Worms! :)
When Richard asked me about &quot;What are we going to do if I want to go 

to more houses? This sucks!&quot; (or something to that effect)
I suggested that instead of asking for candy we would then tell 
the &quot;tricked and treater&quot; parents that since Mommy and me are doing 

NOS and limiting sugar, could they please donate a quarter, instead, 
to his savings account :)
I'm going to try and make him into a great Mummy, with bandages and 
black eyes, and focus on having a great time dressing up...

Hey Hana thanks for the good idea of walking to school...Being a 
very protective parent, and things aren't quite as blissfully &quot;safe&quot; 

as back when I was a kid and walked the 6 blocks to school (they 
probably weren't too safe then either, but it was a much more 
lenient time regarding kids safety) Richard takes the bus since he's 
just 8...He will probably walk once he's around 10 or 11? Also, the 
school doesn't allow candy or fruit rollups junk in their snacks or 
lunchboxes...A NOS school! Plus, back to the walking thing, Richard 
runs around like a wild monkey and has plenty of exercise, but no 
matter what, I really and truly want him to develop those good 
habits now...controlling snacks and sweets is a huge task for 
parents in this day and age, since we are just bombarded with crappy 
food choice alternatives on kids tv, etc... Once he hits adulthood, 
my job will just be to observe and support, but right now, I feel a 
duty to him *and* myself to be sincere and serious about curbing the 
junk food...2 days a week of that is plenty...
Have a great day, and say hi to the puppies :)
Love,
Debbie
PS I went to Kings Point Park yesterday and spent about 2 hours 
wandering around and taking photos...I really hope they come out 
well...If I can get them onto some CDRom maybe soon I can upload 
some new photos of both the famous woodland park *and* Richard 
as &quot;The Mummy&quot; :)
