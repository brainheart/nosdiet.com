&gt; One question - where do people think starbucks coffee sits? It's 
clearly liquid calories, but it's also coffee and I'm not sure if 
it's anything other than milk and coffee, both of which are 
acceptable.

....Hey Michael :) Are you new? If so, welcome :)
So, Starbucks &quot;coffee&quot;.....
I worked there for around 3 months during massage school. By the 
end of that job I was an unadulterated carb junkie...
Their &quot;coffee&quot; drinks with flavoring, like Mocha Lattes and 
Frappucinos are all super loaded with sugar. If we are talking, 
straight Latte or Cappucino, or good old Black coffee, you can 
certainly have it during NonS days. You can even use a bit of 
sugar. But beware...those others are, as you put it, &quot;liquid carbs&quot; 

and they will fatten you up mighty fast. Definite S'ses with a big 
S. So if you love them, save them for your S days, and while you're 
at it, Starbucks makes some of the best dark chocolate I have ever 
had... They are little pieces so unless you buy 5 of them, you can 
have a bit of candy and not go hog wild, but still enjoy a really 
good choco.... I can't stand Starbucks coffee, it makes my stomach 
go into knots.. (but the smell Rocks!) so I was lucky not to crave 
any of those sugary beverages while I was there...Unfortunately, I 
didn't do so well resisting the donuts or other cakes...
Have a good one.
Peace,
Deb
