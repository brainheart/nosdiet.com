I guess I'll throw my two or three cents' worth of &quot;knowledge&quot; into the 
pot, 
with a few things I've heard about caffeine, which is the real issue, since 

it is the &quot;active ingredient&quot; of coffee.

Long ago I checked out a library book about caffeine...oh, here, I just 

found it, so now I can give the exact quote instead of a paraphrase. The 

book is &quot;Caffeine Blues&quot; (see <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3l4kl">http://tinyurl.com/3l4kl</a>) 
and the quote is 
&quot;...if caffeine were proposed today as a new food additive, the FDA would 

never approve it.&quot; At Amazon there is a fairly large excerpt online, and a 

variety of good reviews, if you'd like to take a look.

I have read that caffeine raises bloodstream insulin levels (as sugar does) 

which causes the body to store fat. (This is commonly warned about amongst 

low-carbers.) Anything that prompts the body to go into fat-storage mode is 

probably not attractive to the average dieter. =)

However, a friend of mine once had a doctor prescribe caffeine tablets to 

help her lose weight (a long time ago). It worked for her...so caffeine may 

also speed up the metabolism...? I've known quite a few skinny people who 

seem to subsist on caffeine and cigarettes...and I'm sure you know those 

people too. But in the long run, &quot;skinny&quot; isn't everything, is it? 
=)

These two ideas are confusingly contradictory...and I guess I should read 

that book again. I don't think giving up all caffeine for life is 
necessary, but a little research before continuing to consume large 
quantities might be wise. I have a feeling that for most of us, 
&quot;moderation&quot; would be a good enough rule...but it does seem that certain 

people are more prone to becoming truly addicted, and side effects vary. I 

don't get much of a charge from caffeine and can be happy with decaf most of 

the time...and if I got enough sleep consistently, I think I'd be fine with 

decaf ALL the time. Hmm, there's a thought. Thanks for bringing this up 

because I think it's time for me to consider it again. Caffeine tends to 

creep up gradually.
