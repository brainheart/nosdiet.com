&gt; Haven't we beaten aspartame to death on the list already? Anyone 
can file a lawsuit. We *know* that a lot of people think aspartame is
&gt; poisonous; we also know that no-one's actually been able to 
*demonstrate* Suing CIA, Madonna over mind 
&gt; Rich Lafferty 

Hi Rich, you seem pretty sure that aspartame arguments are all 
conspiricy theories of the same ilk as the above mentioned &quot;Madonna 

sues CIA&quot; (that is funny)
It is a bit upsetting to me because it seems pretty 
reactionary...Could there be a grain of truth, or even more to the 
claims about aspartame and splenda and all of those artificial 
sweeteners being detrimental to the body? I am guessing you consume 
equal or nutrasweet in some form, let me know if this assumption is 
wrong.
I used equal for around 4 years...Not lot's mind you..Maybe about 4 
to 6 packs a day, in my coffee...I assumed because it was so 
commonly found in everything, it must be fairly safe...I think that 
was a wrong assumption...I should mention too, that during those 
years I suffered from intense headaches, allergies, bad bouts of 
bronchitis which would last for very long periods of time, manic 
behavior...I believe that the equal was playing a part in this, it 
was screwing with the integrity of the CNS somehow...Once I read the 
article which I will leave for you to read (it is in a post format, 
but I read it in a different context, a health flyer I picked up in 
my school) I decided to completely eliminate this product from my 
life, because for me, it wasn't worth it if in the long run, *I* 
wound up being the guinea pig in a long term experiment gone wrong. 
I decided to try Splenda, which since they say it is a longer chain 
of sugar, it seemed safer, but then I found some study which cast 
doubt on that as well. I will tell you that after using Equal and 
then stopping completely, I felt better in so many different ways, 
and that all started to happen only within a few months...*My* 
evidence was good enough to confirm my worries about aspartame...I 
was less &quot;on edge&quot; all the time. I almost completely stopped 

getting chronic cases of bronchitis. In general, my overall health 
was better and I was alot less &quot;hyper&quot;
So sorry if you feel that I am continuing to beat this topic to 
death. I think raising awareness doesn't need to be likened to the 
lawsuit where Barney sues PBS for purple dye #47, and I did look at 
your links, whose to judge whether they have any real merit or 
truth..Scathing and pithy yes, but to me seemed very tabloidesque.
Empirical studies are really interesting too...Evidence can present 
itself, but sometimes it can be interpreted from different views. 
Depends who is presenting it right? Studies can finagle with facts, 
and I would prefer to advocate on the side of really finding the 
truth...
Do you remeber a time when it was commonly thought safe to smoke 
regularly? And what was that drug that was popular for, was it 
fertility?, in the 50's which wound up causing major birth defects ?
What about the approval of the use of Agent Orange? They were all 
billed &quot;safe&quot; at some point or another and sadly years later people 

found out the truth.
People should not be the guinea pigs unless they are really aware of 
the risks...I personally think, why not err on the side of 
skepticism while the &quot;jury&quot; is out?
I'll put the link to the letter by Arthur Evangelista, a former FDA 
investigator, at the bottom of this letter

PS..What in blazes is the North Western Tree Octapus? LOL
Peace,
Debbie
