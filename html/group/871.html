Okay Everyone,
I have been silently reading all the E-mails pretending I didn't really 
need
to do this...I guess now is as good a time as any to introduce myself and
get on with doing this for real. My name is Dawn, and I need to loose about
30 lbs. I have done, Atkins, Southbeach, WeightWatchers, and just about
every fad out there. I have taken about every diet pill and personally 
love
anything with Ephedra,(energy) (I know it supposed to be bad...I never
abused it though) For some of you 30 lbs may seem like no big deal, but 
for
me it is...
I am in the National Guard (18 1/2 years) and my weight makes me miss
promotions and gives me major stress. (nothing like dropping your trousers
to have your hips and stomach measured to see if you are in body fat range)
That being said, I still don't find the will power to stay with anything
long enough to get the weight off. I like the sound of this plan. I have
been trying to not do 2nds for a week and now I am ready to do this for
real! This plan will not have me making a different meal for my family 
and
a meal for me. I hated that and I was worried about the messages it sent 
my
children, (mommy is fat, mommy doesn't like her body, mommy is eating a
whole lb of bacon on her &quot;new&quot; diet and it is OK!?!)
I look forward to working with all of you! Encouraging all of you and
getting fit and trim with all of you! I think I will even do something
active tomorrow!
Have a great no&quot;s&quot; day!

Dear group, and especially Melanie,
I had fallen off the no S Diet, in favor of the popular South Beach.
Now I have gained everything back, I shall give myself a swift kick, and
even though it is an S Day, it is a good as any to start. Like Melanie,
any
downward movement on the scale will be welcome, and maybe slow but steady
is
much better than fast and yo yo!
Bonnie
