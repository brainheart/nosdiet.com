Dear, Julieloolie :)
I have another idea. (what a surprise!), and please feel free to let 
me bear your bitchiness cross, I can take it!
Although I wholeheartedly concur that &quot;NoScales&quot; would be a helpful 

addendum to apply to NonS days, one of the beautiful and, if I may, 
almost Spiritual aspects of NoS is it's &quot;non bossy&quot; approach and 

freedom of choice it allows it's &quot;devotees&quot; so to speak...It is 

simple and helpful, because there aren't too many rules in its 
fundamental framework...Not a micromanaging diet, like others... If 
bossy berthas like us had our way, there might be new addendums 
every five seconds to the diet, which would eat away at the &quot;free 

will&quot; aspect of the plan, and eventually, it would become just as 

restrictive, in the long run, as all the other diets which take that 
individual &quot;choice&quot; out of the picture...So even though I thought of 

the same thing before and suggested it, upon later reflection, I 
think that we should leave the rules as they are...This diet is one 
of the only real self improvement plans out there, simply because it 
doesn't make all the personal choices...This is where the real 
challenge lays...Self discipline is a long twisted and very arduous 
road, but it is so much more worth it to say &quot;I am going to make 
this choice for me&quot; as opposed to &quot;I will do what you want me 

to 'master'&quot; however ego-stroking it may be for our fantastic 
founder! LOL
I have a certain feeling that he is agreeing with this, and that 
it's in keeping with his general philosophy :)
The Spirit cannot be beaten into submission. Personal choices are 
the key to using the free will we were all born with :)

&gt;&gt; Yes i am still feeling bitchy today, and if I need to blame it 

on someone I think you are a good choice Debster.After all what are 
friends for. If its too much for you,you can OHMMMMM it 
away

...Check out Everydaysystems.com, Julie... I think that our addendum 
could actually become an everyday system for diet support, to 
compliment the already perfect gem NoS...I would be happy to be a co-
founder with you on that...And hey, who knows? Maybe we could form 
an alliance of &quot;scale hating bitches&quot; all over the world! :)
Love,
Deb
