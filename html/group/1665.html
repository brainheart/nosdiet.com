Yes, the healthcare system is far from perfect but the
point remains is how is the best way to fix things?
Government intervention will most likely be needed at
some level through legislation i.e. - tax credits or
stipends for employee health care and individual
insurance plans and limits on malpractice settlements
, but how much can we rely on the government to REALLY
fix things. If you think putting up with the long
lines at the DMV or the social security office are a
pain in the neck imagine trying to sit around waiting
for a doctor while you have a bad cold or the flu in a
place like that.Ever taste &quot;goverment cheese.&quot; And the
fact remains that in countries where healthcare is run
by the government you pay through the nose to get
private treatment from a REALLY good doctor and
usually only the wealthiest can afford that.

The fact remains that many doctors, lawyers and
insurance companies are killing the goose that is
laying the golden egg through plain old fashioned
greed and stupidity. 

That all being said, one of the reasons people are on
this board is to improve their own health and although
we cannot cure all sorts of diseases without a doctor,
eating sensibly and exercising may be the ultimate
lesson for us all to follow is we want to avoid having
to go to a doctor in the first place. Obesity rates
and the related illesses are at an all-time high and
that is overtaxing an already strained healthcare
system. There is something a doctor cannot help us
with and that is effort on our part.
