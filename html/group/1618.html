I've lost
&gt; around 15-20lbs since the beginning of this year. I so desperately 

want to reach my goal weight (or at least be closer) by the end of 
the year. 
&gt; I hope everyone had a great weekend!

Hi Lissa :) Ah Chocolate...Food of the Gods in the Aztec culture
Who doesn't like it? :) Fortunately for all of us we are still 
allowed to enjoy this indulgent dessert, on S days.
As far as worrying about that 3 meal thing, it's really the first 
week or two which is the biggest adjustment, and there is a little 
loophole built into the plan for those people who absolutely must 
have more meals...If you need your afternoon &quot;snack&quot;, call it a meal 

instead, keep it small and don't vary the number of meals per 
day...In otherwords, don't snack &quot;unconsciously&quot; whenever something 

presents itself, make yourself really wait for a meal...this 
eliminates &quot;autopilot noshing&quot; and curbs calories over the whole 
day.
It does make you focus on making your meals substantial and 
fullfilling as well as (hopefully) healthy...
If you have already lost 15 or 20 lbs that is great, but don't be 
surprised if you may &quot;level off&quot; for a while...plateus do happen and 

it is commonly believed that if a person loses 25 lbs or so over the 
course of a year, this is considered a healthy &quot;Keep it off For 
Good&quot; rate...I will be the first to salute you if you can lose more 

this year, but don't immediately put the &quot;quick loss&quot; psychology to 

work by putting pressure on yourself to lose so much so fast...I 
have been there before numerous times...Yes psych yourself up, but 
if I may, this diet is much more geared towards &quot;pain free&quot; loss 

which is slower, and more maintainable...and life friendly...
Good luck! 
Peace,
Deb
