Donna,
Take heart dear one. Life throws many fast balls - some curves -
sometimes you get the hit - sometimes you don't. Ah, but those
change-ups will break your heart. At first you don't recognize it, and
when you do there is seldom anything you can do about it. So we take
the strike and wait for the next pitch, or the next at bat. We learn,
maybe next time we will &quot;see&quot; it in time. Maybe our grip will 
be
better, or we'll have or other bat. Some how it will be different, will
it be in our favor?
At work sometimes things sneak up on me, and my one secret weapon is
Trail Mix. I am so lucky, our vending machine has trail mix with no
candy - a mix of seeds, nuts, and raisins, a nice mixture. It chews
well, and takes a while to finish. Probably too many calories, but less
then the See's candy bars I sell at my desk for the animal rescue group.
Quite healthy in comparison. 
I rationalize that it would have fit on my plate, and in fact lunch
is usually my smallest meal. So I eat a little too much and it looks
like a snack. So what! In reality what I have accomplished is to built
a wall that keeps the BINGE out. AND I CAN GO ON A BINGE. The first
time I had the trail mix I was on one, I was very disappointed there
were no M&amp;Ms. Later my disappointment turned into satisfaction when 
I
knew the mix had become one of my best allies.
Just for you I, will get the information tomorrow and send the
details, then you will have an ally too. Keep an emergency supply of
something, something semi-healthy and semi-sinful (we all know those
nuts are chock full of fat). Make sure the portion is controlled, that
it is easy to eat (on the run if you have to), and it will tie you over
to the rest of your meal. Let it be the appetizer that makes you
successful.
Love, David H. &lt;&gt;&lt;

today i did not have such a great food day...i was ok until around
lunch, we 
got really busy with some people in really bad shape and i had to delay
my 
lunch by 2 hours...i was so hungry by one ish that i grabbed some
candy... i was 
truly afraid that if i did not eat something that i would make an error
that 
i could not afford to make. after that, it was pick, nibble and nosh the
rest 
of my shift. i think that i could have handled today better, but after
having 
a slip i got a really bad attitude. i am sick and tired of eating bad
and 
being fat.
i will stop eating for tonight, and tomorrow will be a no s day ( or
else ! )
