&gt; but I did and I have lost 
&gt; over 2 lbs this week by being very good! :)

This is great. The &quot;being good&quot; part even more than
the 2 pounds. Focus on strict days on habit as your
metric. According to my brand new scale I can gain or
lose as much as 5 pounds in a day (I'm stepping on it
more than usual in futile attempt to weigh our baby).
This is obviously crazy, so I don't begin to worry
about it.

&gt; Again, forgive my posting length and frequency,

Length is not a problem, as far as the iron moderator
is concerned. Don't worry about it. I'd far rather
have one big post than lots of little ones.

&gt;It has only taken me 2 days to
&gt; acclimate to 
&gt; lowering the amount of sugar in my coffee...
&gt; Even if I only cut out one teaspoon, that saves me
&gt; 730 teaspoons of 
&gt; sugar every year (I drink two cups of coffee a day)

Great. Little tweaks like this over time are far more
effective than grand, flamboyant gestures.

&gt; Dear no S,
&gt; Looking at my new calendar and every day had an
&gt; orange Star, for doing
&gt; no S, 

...

&gt; 2 and 1/2 pounds
&gt; this week gone, goodbye,

Congratulations! Build on those invested days. It
won't be much longer till habit starts to kick in. As
I mentioned to Deb above, focus more on days than on
pounds at this point.

&gt; Well, it's time to start a new week of No-S. I did
&gt; well the 2 days ( I started back Thursday)

A 2 day week may not be a big milestone, but take what
you can get. Congratulations!

&gt; Thanks for the advice about
&gt; eating more at meals. It just seems odd to be on
this
&gt; &quot;diet&quot; and get to eat a good bit.

At the beginning, all you're really doing is
reorganizing your eating habits so that your senses
can figure out how much you are eating without a
calculator. You *see* how much food is on your plate.
You *taste* whether something is sweet or not. These
are more compeling and sustainable and natural guides
than mere numbers. You're re-normalizing your diet,
not doing some weird new thing. That it seems odd to
do something normal shows how messed up most of our
habits are.

&gt; If you dont mind my asking. . .how much do you
&gt; splurge on your &quot;off days&quot; (Sat and Sun)? I guess I
&gt; just want to know how much I can get away with and
&gt; still have No-S work LOL! 

I don't worry about this at all and I'd encourage you
not to. I think people who do do so at the expense of
their weekdaily habits. You only have so much
attention to give. It's much more profitably invested
during the week. What you do 5/7 of the time is not
only more important in itself, but will unconsciously
start to carry over to the remaining 2/7 without
additional intervention. It may not work right away,
or 100%, but it will eventually, and it will make a
decisive difference. I do have some excessive
weekends, even now, but mostly they're better than my
pre-nosdiet ordinary days.
