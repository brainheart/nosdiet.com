Here's a great salad to try out :)

Mix Romaine lettuce, mesclun mixed greens, grape tomatoes, cucumber, 
shredded red cabbage, some carrots, and two tablspoons of red kidney 
beans (for protein) Garnish with 2 teaspoons of raisins and slices 
of 4 or 5 fresh strawberries :)

Deb's dressing (Newman move yer'ass over!)
Juice of one orange, half teaspoon of lime juice, two sesame oil, 
two splashes of rice wine vinegar, splash of balsamic vinegar, half 
teaspoon of mustard, two teaspoons of mayonaise, some salt and 
pepper to taste.

This salad is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the tastebuds, with 
it's lively mix of red and green colors and sweet and tangy tastes...

For the last two weeks or so, I have noticed that I have almost no 
appetite in the mornings, and we usually eat dinner between 5 and 
6:30.... Rather than go back for various snacks after dinner, I have 
decided that I will be changing my three meals to 4... My breakfast 
is usually pretty small, and I don't think that's going to change 
soon... It's really hard when I'm trying to be quick and get dinner 
ready for my son and me to take the time to prepare a really great 
salad... I will try to do this in advance if I can think ahead, but 
for now, I consider this salad as my version of &quot;dessert&quot;... And 

though it breaks with the 3 plate rule, it still is healthful stuff 
and *not* Ben and Jerry's! Sometimes I don't feel like I need this 
but lately I have, so this is going to be an experiment for me in 
bending one of the NoS rules... I can't decide whether to consider 
this a meal unto itself, or just a second course in an extended 
dinner... No matter what, it still beats endless trips to the fridge 
once dinner is done, into the wee wee hours...
Hey Richard is playing guitar and singing for me now, a first class 
serenade! Guess what he's playing folks... Well one quick hint, his 
mother is a Deadhead, so for tonight it's &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot; by 

the Grateful Dead! What a little chip of the oldish block :)
Hope you are all having great weeks so far! :)
Love and Peace,
Deb
