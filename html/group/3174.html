Hey folks, Reinhard, esteemed Nos colleagues :)
I started a part time morning job today... and old position I used 
to have as a delivery girl for &quot;Tada&quot; auto parts! LOL...
Well desperate times etc....
Anyway, I didn't have any time to have a good breakfast before I ran 
out, and just took a large apple and a coffee with me... Really this 
was actually not such a bad breakfast, but the problem was that I 
was all off schedule and ate it around 11:00... By the time I came 
home and Richard came home from school, at 3:45, we were both pretty 
hungry, so I started making our dinner very early, like 4:45...
By the time the food was on the table, my mind was telling me &quot;you 

can have seconds Deb. After all this will count as lunch and 
dinner..&quot;
Well that's what my old mind said, but my new body said &quot;you are 
full stupid! Stop stuffing your mouth when you are not really 
hungry!&quot;
(that is after I had a good sized plate of food, and had gone into 
seconds mode)
I didn't listen, and let me just say, that I am shocked at how 
uncomfortable it felt to simply eat an extra cup of rice, when it 
really wasn't necessary...
I am still revolted by the &quot;stuffed to the gills, I am going to 
heave&quot; feeling of STUFFEDNESS for a lack of better word...
This will not happen again any time soon if I use todays experience 
to inform my future choices...
I'm really thrilled at how much my appetite has changed, and just a 
little p.o'd that my seconds habit is still somewhere dormant, and 
looking for opportunities to slip me up...
I'll plan out my meals better starting manana to minimize the chance 
of screwups...
For now, I am still sitting here groaning...
Ugghhhhhhsshgghhhgdhhhhlllggmphmhhhh.... &quot;pop&quot; (sound of exploding 

abdomen like in Monty Pythons the Meaning of Life!)
Love,
Deb
