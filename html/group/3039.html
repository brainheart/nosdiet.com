Hey you guys :)
I wanted to thank you Reinhard for that post about emotional 
eating...
I had quite an upset night yesterday and an even more upsetting 
morning today.... But guess what? I didn't go nuts eating to 
comfort myself... Though at one point last night I had a thought to 
run down and get something, it was way after dinner and I then heard 
*you* in my mind saying
&quot;you will only be punishing yourself&quot; and &quot;Be nice to yourself&quot;
So I didn't! I have been trying too hard to be good, to let a sad 
evening (and we are talking the waterworks were on big time!) make 
me fat. That's no solution is it? I won't use food to medicate my 
bad feelings anymore. That was a really good moment for me so thanks 
for listening guys!
What a good influence and saving grace you and this group has been 
to me... I am finally tackling these life long issues with success 
and I am so proud. I'm still losing weight this week and my inches 
are consistently going down, especially my arms..
I'm too embarrased to say what I started out as inchwise around my 
arms and my waist, but lately I don't even need to &quot;flex&quot; my biceps 

to see and feel the definition which is starting to just &quot;be there&quot; 

Woo hoo! They are now into the next &quot;inch&quot; notch down on my tape 

measure.. Yayyyyy :)
Peace and Love,
