Dear Deb,
True, if you pay attention to all out there you will go bonkers...does
that cause cancer. I think he means way too much sugar....like my cousins
little boy who only ate candy and was very small for his age...he needed
real food, but was very spoiled. Too much of cigarettes is not healthy..
mabe not cancer all the time, but many other things go on .....shortness 
of
breath, higher stress levels,
blah, blah, blah. While this Douglas will get a little carried away, I 
still
think that we are feeding our kids way too much sugar. Myself, this was
something that my Mom was careful of, not too many sweets in our home....she
was afraid or Mr. Toothdecay. This was before Flouride in everything. We
could have a chocolate or two and a soda but only on Sunday. Of course 
we
could have ice cream everyday....it is a family thing. With my own kids, 
my
son never liked sugar, most likely because I never had much taste for it,
but my daughter loved it....she took after her dad. I had to be careful 
with
her, not so much dental,but she was a picky eater, and if she ate candy 
or
cookies, she, like my cousins son, would not eat real food. This only
happened at her other Grandma's because I only let her have a sweet if 
she
ate her dinner......&quot;if you dont eat your meat you won't get any pudding,&quot;
old wise song words from the past. I am sure other Moms have had this
problem......tooo much sugar spoils the soup.
The other point of this Auntie Anti Sugar role of mine is often if a kid
eats too muc h of it, they often get chubby....you see that more and more
these days, and I see a lot of it on my husbands side, and that is a problem
they must deal with all their adult life.
Peace, Bonnie
