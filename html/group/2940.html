&gt; I generally exercise (weight train) on MWF in the evenings - after 

work - around 6-7pm; and then I have my dinner. Q2: Would having a 
protein shake pre-workout constitute a snack? Based on the basic NoS 
rules, that would be a yes. So, this begs another question - how can 
I sustain the high weights if there is a long gap between lunch and 
dinner? Hope these Q make sense.
.....Hi Mahesh! Deb here... To me, your shake sounds like a meal. 
It's not a haagen daaz bar or baskin robbins or 
starubucks &quot;Frappucino&quot; so it's not a sweet, since I am assuming 

this is a real protein shake... Snacks are unplanned events 
inbetween meals, like eating something just because it's there at an 
office meeting or whatever... The main problem with this kind 
of &quot;snacking&quot; is its unaccountability...
If you feel you really need your shake to give you energy for your 
workout, just shave a little bit off your dinner and consider 
yourself as doing NoS with 4 meals not three...
We are trying to eliminate that bad behavior of hitting the snack 
vending machines whenever one is around, etc... I guess one could 
argue that you might try working out on an empty stomach blah blah 
blah, but if this little personal tweak you make is the key to you 
doing NoS for life, then do it.
Many of us have been NoSsing with 70 to 80 percent strictness on 
some days, still you will achieve your goal...
Just keep in mind that you really shouldn't change your meal habits 
every two days.. IE: one day 3 meals next 4 then 2 then 5, you get 
the idea... Build a healthy habit of eating regular meals.
I am almost certain Reinhard will agree with this, that is unless 
your &quot;protein&quot; shake is really a supersized chocolate milkshake from 

Burger King! :)
Good luck Mahesh!
Peace,
Deb
ps.. I was really worried that eliminating snacks would be hard, and 
my blood sugar would get all screwed up, etc....After all, I had 
Diabetes for a while and I assumed that this wouldn't really be the 
best thing (wrongly so) for my sugar/insulin levels... I joined in 
the end of August last year, do SG 5 days a week and look forward to 
Spring arriving so I can get the heck out there and see some scenery!
I never snack anymore and it took only a few weeks to accomplish 
this. Finally my portion size has decreased and I am really happy 
about my better eating!
