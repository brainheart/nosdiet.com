In the flood of recent posts there were some new
member intros and success stories that I'd like to
acknowledge at least briefly. 

1) Welcome Jen from Australia and thanks for being
such an avid poster. I'm happy to hear you don't mind
me repeating myself -- I worry sometimes. 

2) Welcome Annie from Kansas. So we now have members
from both Ozes. That has to be some kind of good
magic.

3) Congratulations on the 15 pounds, Navin. 9 months,
that's fantastic. As for your work food question, I do
a few things: 

a) if you possibly can without being rude, ignore it.
Having a cup of coffee to keep other people company
while they snack makes this less antisocial. I'm
pretty sensitive about being rude, but I find that
it's usually not an issue. Beware of using it as an
excuse. Chances are the only person with their eye on
you and the cupcakes is you.

b) if &quot;a&quot; doesn't fly, and it'll keep, accept the food
gift and save it till the next S day. I have a
coworker who bakes cookies and brownies most Fridays
and brings me one to take home for Saturday. She
knows my system, she's not offended.

&quot;a&quot; should catch 80-90% of the problem, &quot;b&quot; maybe
another 5%. The 5% left over probably isn't worth
systematic intervention. 

4) Congratulations Michael, on your qualitatively
matchless if unquantified success. We should all
measure our successes in &quot;wonderful women&quot; met. If nos
played even a tiny roll in that, I'm honored.

5) Congratulations, Anne, on hitting the one month
mark and losing 4-5 pounds. I like your additional
rule: &quot;no reading diet books or articles.&quot; Because of
the web site, I feel duty bound to pay attention to
this stuff. Not only is it time consuming, but if I
didn't have &quot;founders zeal,&quot; I'd probably be tempted
by this new thing and that and never stick witha
anything.

6) Congratulations on making it to week 3, David. The
magic, habit cementing number approaches...

7) Thanks Deb, for you prolific, funny and inspiring
posts. You're pinch hitting for me. 

Please pipe up if I missed someone.

I'm happy it's been such a successful couple of weeks
for so many and wish I could spare time for more
generous acknowledgments, but paternal duty calls
(loudly).

Reinhard
