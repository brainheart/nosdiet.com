Hi Kimi!

I've been lurking here for the past two weeks (and following the diet=20
and have lost 5 pounds so far) but your email made me want to write.

I too was overweight in junior high. Unfortunately, I did not tackle=20
the fact head-on and just ate more to &quot;make myself feel better.&quot; 
By=20
high school I was 180 (at 5'5&quot;). You can imagine the comments, the=20
missed activities, the hell that was gym class. But that wasn't the=20
worst of it... By my 43rd birthday I weighed 360 pounds. That is what=20
they call &quot;morbidly obese,&quot; meaning you're so fat the fat ALONE 
can=20
kill you. Imagine carrying around a 200-pound backpack you can never=20
take off! I won't even go into the health issues because they get way=20
too scary, but believe me, it's bad. I tried ever diet imaginable, at=20
one point lost 100 pounds using the drugs Phen-Fen (only to gain it all=20
back and more when the drugs were pulled off the market as unsafe.)=20
It's made my life miserable.

No... I have made my life miserable. Every day we see people born with=20
handicaps they can never &quot;fix.&quot; Our weight is something we ourselves=20
control. And who the heck wants their weight to be the most important=20
thing in their life?

I think you have a very healthy attitude toward what's going on right=20
now. The reason to lose weight is so that you can enjoy everything in=20
life as much as you can. To be a strong, healthy young woman full of=20
energy and confidence is a great gift. Deal with this now, sensibly and=20
in a way that gives you a solid foundation for healthy eating all your=20
life, and it will become second nature for you. (I commend you on=20
utilizing Reinhard's approach, which is the most astonishingly sane=20
plan I have ever come across!)

A lot of people now are nervous about girls losing weight because so=20
often it swings into unhealthy body-images in line with the freakishly=20
thin models we see everywhere. So make sure your family understands you=20
know the difference between being healthy and starving yourself. The=20
world is full of sugary sodas, junk food, and things pretending to be=20
healthy that really aren't. Be smart and avoid making the &quot;easy&quot;=20
choices you'll see so many of your friends making. Accept and get over=20
the fact that some people can eat anything and stay thin while most of=20
us can't. (It's unfair. It sucks. Move on. Ya know?)

And always remember that there is NOTHING nastier on the planet than=20
catty teenage girls. Yes, it would be nice to shut them up, but they=20
will just find something else to criticize, they always do. Do this for=20
you and for all your future plans. (Oh, and tell that cute friend of=20
yours how much you appreciate his support. He sounds like a keeper! ;)

I wish you all the best and hope you'll let us know how it's going.

&gt; =A0=A0=A0 Hi All!!=A0 I just joined and thought I should introduce 
myself=

&gt; I'm a 15-year-old overweight girl.=A0 I'm sick of being overweight,
&gt; I'm sick of always feeling like someone is making remarks of my
&gt; weight, and I'm just plain sick of feeling fat!=A0 I weigh around 
150
&gt; lbs. and I want to lose anywhere between 20-30 pounds!=A0 I started
&gt; this diet yesterday, the day after my Birthday.=A0 It's surprising 
how
&gt; much that I've realised how much I eat!=A0
&gt; =A0=A0=A0 Everyone get's a &quot;wake up call&quot; to do something, but, I 
prefer
&gt; to call it inspiration.=A0 I just graduated from the 8th grade and 
for
&gt; our last class trip, we went to a camp for 3 days.=A0 Well, on the
&gt; first day when I was in the cooking group, one of my close friends
&gt; informed me that the other girls kept saying how I needed to go on 
a
&gt; diet.=A0 I felt like I got slapped in the face when I heard this!=A0
&gt; Later that night, the same girls invited some of the boys over to
&gt; our cabin.=A0 They thought I was asleep, but I heard everthing they
&gt; said (which I confronted them about the next day, a HUGE step for
&gt; me).=A0 They said horrible things about me, and I was always nice 
to
&gt; every single one of them!!=A0 Anyways, a couple of weeks ago, my best
&gt; friend called and told me something that brought my self-esteem way
&gt; up.=A0 My best friend is a boy, I'd say a cute boy.=A0 I always thought
&gt; he was embarassed by the way I looked.=A0 But, he said that no matter
&gt; what happens in the next 4 years, he'll always be there for me!!=A0 
I
&gt; felt like crying I was so happy!=A0 I guess that's part of my
&gt; inspiration, although the first part wasn't really inspiration.
&gt; =A0=A0=A0 Well, now you know some of my story, and I expect I've ranted 
=
on
&gt; for far too long!
&gt;
&gt; Best Wishes To Everyone,
&gt; ~*~*Kimi*~*~
&gt;
&gt; P.S.=A0 I've never faced my weight problem before, this has been a
&gt; huge summer so far for me!
