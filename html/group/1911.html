&gt; Hi There, Yes it was gwen shamblin, i was a part of weigh down,
&gt; alot of it made alot of sense,waiting for hunger etc.. I heard she
&gt; was in financial trouble?? know anything? Julie
&gt; 
&gt; No, sorry, I don't. I just read about her program in a magazine 
and ordered 
&gt; the book (used)...tried it for a bit, didn't find it very 
practical, though 
&gt; it was a valuable experience. It really is true that &quot;hunger is 

the best 
&gt; spice.&quot; Fortunately, if we do No S right, we can experience that 

same 
&gt; benefit most of the time!

Hi Diane, I forgot that quote, but so true. Right now i am ravenous, 
but its okay to be hungry i keep telling myself:) I also believe 
tahat this plan is much more practical. She was always about waiting 
til you were hungry, fine if you knew what it felt like. Some of the 
prople i did it with at church had never felt hunger since they were 
kids, so it was double hard for them. I don't know about you but i 
am sick of all the &quot;cures&quot;. Thenewest i heard about last night on 

the John Tesh radio show was that there are three new fat burning 
pills coming out soon that are currently being approved by the FDA.
He was laughing about it and said&quot;how about we all just eat less 
food&quot;. Amen Maybe I will call in one night and tell him about NOS.:) 

well i must get back to work stuff. Have a great day.Julie
