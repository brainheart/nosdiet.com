Now that one seems more up your alley, roughing it!
I missed that one, but it looked cool...We take modern conveniences 
so for granted at times...I'm sure those people were happy to come 
home to the comforts of hot running water and charmin toilet paper 
when it was all over...

I am just sick of all the others, since it's getting to the point 
where there's nothing to watch except the inane ones, and they are 
just taking up all the channels...

Yeesh!
.....you get my point :)
Boy what a trend Survivor started...I can't wait for it's demise.
Even Geico is spoofing this trend with the commercials for &quot;Tiny 
House&quot; which is pretty funny.

So here's a little tidbit about sugar...Ever wonder if those rumors 
are true that sugar makes kids hyper?
For the two nights after Halloween, I decided that I'd let Richard 
go completely wild and just eat as much as he wanted of his 
candies...
I figured it would be an interesting study and then the quicker it 
was gone, the happier I'd be not having to look at it, or argue 
about it. I imagined that, maybe, he would have 4 or 5 and be 
satisfied....Wrong
He must have eaten candy for one and a half hours straight, one 
lollipop after another, not too many chocolates but a bunch of 
lollies and twizzlers (I love those!) and whatever....
I tell you, by the time he had eaten, probably 20 candies at once, 
he was, no exaggerations here, doing his version of Michael 
Flatley's Riverdance only at triple speed! He almost took the wax of 
the wooden floor boards with all the fancy footwork! :)
I was laughing at it, but man how it altered his state, he was 
bouncing off the walls...I wish I could have taped it for you 
guys...It was like he was trying to get into the Guinness book of 
world records for tap dancing. 
Last night I decided to &quot;pull the candy plug&quot; and before he had a 

chance to raid the remaining lollipops (about 5 were left) I just 
dumped them...You ask if sugar is addictive? He was none too happy 
when he went scavenging around for them for his third night of going 
nuts on sugar...When I told him that I dumped them he almost growled!
Too bad....he can wait till another S day :)
It was the sugar growling, not him!
Peace,
Debbie
