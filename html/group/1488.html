--- In , &quot;Valerie Akers&quot; &lt;valakers@m...&gt; . 
I have been on a serious binge since Friday. My life is like that 
carnival game where you have a big rubber hammer and about five 
holes that have heads popping out of them. As soon as you bash one 
head back into its hole, another head pops out of another hole. 
Eventually you are frantically whirling this way and that, bashing 
heads all over the place, yet you can't keep them all down...

Hi Valerie :) Do you mean the wild and wacky
&quot;Whack-A-Mole&quot; ?
I truly understand how you must feel...You just seem to be buffetted 
around by all these crazed &quot;heads&quot; jumping up when you least expect 

it...If you feel that the plan was working for you, great! Don't 
give up on yourself when the road gets rocky... I too have terrible 
binge patterns..I really think part of it is physiological (ie the 
kind of cravings I experience, versus the frequency) and often they 
are just times where I am hoping to find some kind of comfort when 
things are crazy...Intellectually we can tell ourselves &quot;Have some 

willpower, didn't we go through this a million times before&quot; and 
still fall into those same patterns over and over...It can be 
crushing...Think of the plan as your chance to form a relationship 
with food, not just a diet...If it is going to last, you have to 
take it seriously...But lets face it, for most of us this is 
something that will take a huge amount of effort...Okay, you have 
moles trying to jump at you from every corner of your life (I assume 
these are family, job, partner, and whatever other stressors Life 
hands you) Just remember, that you have a new chance each day, and 
if you stick with it, even through the &quot;F*%k'ups&quot;...(Okay so you 

binged YOU ARE JUST HUMAN GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK! :), just commit to 
yourself and get off of the Titanic...I had a complete meltdown 
yesterday and absolutely HAD to have some chocolate ice cream...I 
ate it, and guess what? I am still on track...I will not let a 
little brown dessert spoil my fun and &quot;do me in&quot;...Now as far as 

alcohol addiction, this infact may be very Sugar related 
too...Alcohol has a lot of that, and if you need to be in a support 
group for drinking, do it. Smoking, it is a major appetite 
suppressant and quitting will probably increase your appetite. 
Nevertheless, if you don't you will be a good candidate for heart 
attack, emphysema, stroke, lung cancer, and have really yellow teeth.

I hope you can forgive yourself for that little binge and try to 
think of it in a differnt way...Just as a Setback...Not a total 
derailment. Use this plan as a kind of &quot;anchor&quot; if you may, to keep 

you sane in at least ONE area of your life...It won't be perfect all 
the time, but that is just not realistic...Be 80% all of the time, 
rather than 100% perfect 0% of the time. I know that I am coming 
off as a total know it all, but really I just want to offer my 
support to you, so forgive my preaching tone...I personally love 
that game Whack a Mole, I find it exciting...In real life, those 
moles just make me cuckoo! Three weeks is great, start over right 
now! Focus on anything you are doing that is positive and get out of 
the vicious cycle...Start your own &quot;Happy&quot; cycle :)
So I will just close with this question taken from Maimonedes, I 
think. Paraphrased of course:

&quot;If I am not for myself, then who will be?&quot;

Good luck and just keep on going, you will get it one day :)
Love,
Deb
