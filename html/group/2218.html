&gt; Wow Deb! How old is Richard? I'm lucky to be able to do simple 
addition in my head . 

....Yes I can relate Carrie :) I am mentally deficient in this area 
and it stresses me out just to have to do those simple equations... 
He, on the other hand, has an innate love of numbers. He is 
fascinated with them... The bigger the number the better... When he 
was around 5 years old, and at that time we had no tv connection so 
once in a while we watched videos, but there was plenty of time for 
pursuing other things like reading and more creative stuff, I found 
him lying on the floor in his room, with a notebook in which he was 
creating columns and columns of math equations... I asked him what 
he was doing and he told me that he was creating a &quot;multiplication 

table for the number 5&quot;. It started at 1x5 and went up to around 
500! I noticed this interest in &quot;ordering&quot; things and numbers, when 

he was very young... At one year old he had more fun playing with 
his blocks by placing them in a line on the floor from one end of 
the room to the other, and placing the blocks in size ascending 
order... Another cute thing I noticed was, even when he would read 
a book, the excitement, for him, came from &quot;accumulating&quot; chapters 

read... He was reading Harry Potter by kindergarten, again during 
the tv free time, and he would come from his room to report on how 
far he had gotten in the book... every hour he'd say &quot;I'm on page 

78&quot; then &quot;I'm on page 100&quot; etc.... It was the numbers that gave him 

the thrill... Last thing, I'll mention in this long non-diet post, 
oh did I mention I like food?, is, one time he came over to me with 
the large Yellow pages and told me with excitement in his voice, 
that &quot;hey mom, this book has over 1000 pages!&quot; Clearly it wasn't 

the content of the &quot;book&quot; but just the amount of pages that 
interested him.... I think he wants to be an astrophysicist when he 
grows up... I wouldn't doubt it if he does do that.. Where else can 
you use &quot;astronomical&quot; numbers on a regular basis... He loves it, 

and I don't know where he got it from, but it's great!

&gt; Here's a good quote I saw today, wanted to share it with you all. 

Have a great day guys!
&gt; Carrie :)
&quot;You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you 
don't try.&quot;
Beverly Sills

....It figures. Those operas always end with someone meeting their 
doom! :) LOL
Peace,
Deb :)
