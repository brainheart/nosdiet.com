Hi all, I thought I would share an intersting development for me...
I had one of my &quot;stress induced&quot; call Chinese food moments 
yesterday...Chinese food is totally a quick fix for me in these 
times (somewhat physically, but mostly psychological fix)
So I didn't go wild and totally berserk, but I didn't really feel 
hungry before the food came and I could have easily done with a much 
lighter dinner...Anyway, the great thing I thought after eating this 
unnecessary meal, was that I could really sense the 
uncomfortable &quot;overfull&quot; feeling and, this is the good part,
*Not* like it...I must have changed sufficiently these first few 
weeks in, to realize that the &quot;stuffed to the gills&quot; feeling, is 

just GROSS. I slipped mentally a little, and went on autopilot, but 
I was left with such a bloated blechy feeling, and with my new NoS 
perspective on eating, I realized the wonderful effect that waiting 
to eat,at the right time, has had on my body and mind...When I eat 
because I am really actually hungry, mind you, not raging hungry 
just normal hungry, and I stop when I have had enough, I feel very 
satified... I know that the old habits will take some nudging to 
change, and lets face it people, PMS doesn't help LOL
But I love the new real freedom I am learning to have with eating 
and a respect for myself that I haven't had for well over a year.
Did 4 hours of chair massage today,,will wield my shovelglove 
tomorrow :)
I am going to get ripped! LOL
Hope all of you had a great S day...Richard and I had our yummy 
Baskin and Robbins yesterday...Rocky Road!
Peace and Love,
Debbie
