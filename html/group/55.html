Hi Deborah,

I personally don't have too much of an issue with fast
food at the moment. Not that I don't love it, one of
our fondest wedding related moments was the &quot;family
sized&quot; bucket of KFC we ate on the beach afterward
because we'd been too nervous to eat much at the
reception, but because I like to cook for dinner and
I've got easy, reasonably healthy default meals in
place for breakfast and lunch. Pirateman2k and Lynda
give excellent advice, I'm pretty much going to echo
that.

Here goes:

1. As pirateman2k suggests, make it an S if it's a
problem. &quot;S-days&quot; are a useful construct for lots of
habits (even if they don't start with S). That way you
can console yourself with the weekend prospect of
eating that big mac when you're going without during
the week, and imagine how good it will taste when you
can eat it without guilt come the weekend. 

2. Ask yourself *when* you are succumbing to this
temptation. Is it usually for breakfast, lunch, or
dinner? When you are on the road or every day? When
you've identified your weak point, identify
alternatives. If you travel a lot and must eat out
somewhere, subway sounds like a good alternative
(thanks for all the details, Lynda). If lunch is your
problem, bag it or make sure you have lunch supplies
at work. Exactly what you choose is less important
than the fact that you have *some* intelligent default
in place. It doesn't mean you have to eat bagged lunch
or subway every day, but just that you know &quot;If I
can't think of something better, this is my easy,
reasonably healthy no-brainer alternative.&quot; Easy is
just as important as healthy, because if it isn't, you
won't do it. My defaults are &quot;mestemacher&quot; bread with
something for breakfast, oatmeal for lunch (quick to
prepare and easy to keep at work). I don't think
either of these has wide appeal, I mention them just
to get your gears spinning.

Good luck,

Reinhard

&gt; Hello,
&gt; I think I am addicted to fast food. Has anyone else
&gt; ever experienced multiple big mac attacks and been
&gt; able to overcome the addiction? Thanks for any help
&gt; you can give me.
