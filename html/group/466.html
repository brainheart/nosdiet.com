I'm a newer newbie than you lot, but I'm horrified at the way you go on. 
How
can anyone eat a full pint, or more come to that, of ice cream. Are you 
mad
or what?

Surely the treat bit at weekends is simply a treat, nothing more - it
doesn't mean you eat all you would have done during the week to catch up.
You need a bit of common sense. Don't say you need more guidance - take
responsibility for yourself, it's your life after all.

Well, I'm not exactly a newbie anymore, but I have the SAME EXACT 
PROBLEM on the weekends.... I do &quot;pretty&quot; well on the weekdays. I 

never have full-blown snacks, but I may have a &quot;bite&quot; of something 

between meals to get me to the next meal if it is a few hours away. 
But come the weekend, it's like the rules disappear altogether. I'll 
eat till I'm full at meals, eat snacks anytime I want, and then I'll 
go and buy myself a treat or two, like ice cream, cookies, or candy 
bars. The problem is, I &quot;inhale&quot; the treat, whatever it is. If it's 

cookies, I'll eat half the package, If ice cream, I eat the whole 
package if it's a pint, or 1/3 to 1/2 the package if a half-gallon. 
Then, of course, I'll come back to it later or next day so it's all 
gone by the end of the weekend. I know this follows the letter of the 
nosdiet rules, but I just *know* that I must be undoing any good that 
I achieve during the week. And I walk almost every day (usually 3 
miles), and do shovelglove 5x a week. But I have not really lost any 
net pounds after about a month.

I have a feeling that the relaxed rules for the weekends is too 
liberal for me and my personality. But if I make it too strict, human 
nature will make me rebel and resent it. So what can I do to add more 
discipline to my s-days?

&gt; Howdy!! Just posting to say how excited I am to actually find a 
&gt; group that fits my &quot;live-it&quot; style..hehe I keep telling myself it's 

&gt; not a diet..it's a &quot;live-it&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I am a Stay at Home mom of four children, ages 12, 11, 6 and 9 
months.
&gt; I have lived by the &quot;No Ss&quot; rule for a month or so now and lost 

seven 
&gt; pounds. Now recently I find myself sliiiiding back into bad 
habits. 
&gt; While it's true I don't eat &quot;garbage foods&quot; on the weekdays, I seem 

&gt; to make up for it on the weekends. Why is this? and I'm not even 
a 
&gt; fan of sweets, just during one week a month it seems. And 
snacking. 
&gt; Again, when no one is home I do soooo well, eat all my veggies and 

&gt; drink TONS of water, but on the weekends it seems harder.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I pose this question....if I'm doing so well on the weekdays, 

am 
&gt; I just undoing it on the weekends?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in Advance...
&gt; 
&gt; Pal....pondering all the new and wonderful friends I'm gonna make 

&gt; here.
