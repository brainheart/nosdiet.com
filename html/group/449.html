Hi Tom,

The suits and close/odd camera shots tell me &quot;if you
don't have anything to conceal, why are you wearing
camouflage?&quot; The Atkin's numbers were first reported
by the Wall Street Journal... not exactly a fly by
night operation. Baggy suits, adobe photoshop, and a
multimillion dollar PR operation can cover a multitude
of sins... (though I am surprised what a poor job they
did on these covers) and if EVERYONE is the business
is fat, there's not going to be much incentive for
exposure, right? I could be wrong, but I think there's
something at least mildly fishy going on here. 

BUT, all this being said, you're right that it's not
that important: we've got more than spite to go on
here.

Also, I'm not disputing that some of the points these
guys make are not true in some sense of the word
(tucked away in an enormous volume of fluff). My
problem with them is not that they don't work, if
applied to lab rats or the human equivalent, but that
long term most people are just not going to be able to
make the requisite sacrifice of pleasure in food that
these diets seem to require. Maybe it is good for some
people to be informed by the knowledge(?) that high
carb/white carb foods are to be minimized, but I
personally haven't found it to be necessary.

Thanks for pushing back on this, Tom -- makes the
group much more interesting. Also, I do feel kind of
bad for Atkins' widow after the whole Bloomberg thing,
and will officially stop ragging on him now.

&gt; Hello;
&gt; 
&gt; The picture links are below.
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree. I looked at the Amazon book pictures of
&gt; Weil, Phil, and 
&gt; Atkins. I don't think you can tell from the pictures
&gt; that they are 
&gt; fat or not. They certainly don't have a runner's
&gt; look, but as far as 
&gt; I know they don't push all that much exercise. I was
&gt; looking around 
&gt; my classroom and faculty room today, looking at
&gt; everybody's face, 
&gt; separating it mentally from the body. There were
&gt; round faces on 
&gt; skinny-enough bodies and vice versa.
&gt; 
&gt; The suits told me nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a fair question, though. I wonder about Spears
&gt; (Zone) and the 
&gt; Eanes (Protein Power) and Shwarzbein (sp?)
&gt; (Shwartzbein?). 
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't read Weil or Phil, but the others I think
&gt; contributed a lot 
&gt; by knocking down the anti-fat high carb idea. As
&gt; I've said before, 
&gt; they are often looked upon and reported in a
&gt; hysterical, sensational 
&gt; way, polarized and misrepresented. Now, after they
&gt; have apparently 
&gt; won the argument in the media for now, they are
&gt; still misunderstood. 
&gt; The media has a hard time getting anything straight
&gt; with their sound 
&gt; bites and their need to sell news.
&gt; 
&gt; I flat out don't believe Atkins was 70 lbs
&gt; overweight as reported. 
&gt; Even his suits could not have hidden that. Having
&gt; the biggest name 
&gt; out there, he and his diet ideas have been the
&gt; biggest target of all. 
&gt; He died as a result of a fall (I feel safe in
&gt; believing that, but who 
&gt; knows). Whether he would have eventually died of
&gt; whatever other 
&gt; condition, or whether that condition was a result of
&gt; his diet, is all 
&gt; just speculation.
&gt; 
&gt; The good news IMO is that the nosdiet can match or
&gt; even beat any 
&gt; other diet out there. It is fun to compare the cost
&gt; of reading the 
&gt; nos website, or even just the preamble to this
&gt; group, against the 
&gt; cost and time to buy and read all the volumes of
&gt; diet books and 
&gt; programs, good or bad.LOL.

&gt; &gt; If the prospect of millions of dollars in sales
&gt; can't
&gt; &gt; inspire you to lose weight, what can? But I guess
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; figured (rightly, sadly) that suckers will pay
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; so.
