Hey Guys and Gals, and everyone inbetween! 
I keep seeing my stupid Flintstones post title from a week ago, and 
be sure to see more silly titles from gratefuldeb in the future...a 
note to the newbies. When replying to the content on a post you 
see, just hit reply...Clearly no one has seen that episode where 
Fred eats the turkey and joins overeaters anonymous...too bad it was 
great.
If your topic is something new like a hello or a congrats or a 
totally new thing, (ie: great new recipe, check it out, etc..) It's 
kind of cool to break the previous thread (ie don't just hit reply) 
and instead go to the left side of the page and use the &quot;post&quot; 

button...then you can entitle your message as you wish...this will 
aid future archive browsers to kindof have an idea of what's in the 
new post, as they sort through the many messages that I, oops I 
mean, we No'ssers put up on the web...
The other idea I had for all of us, was maybe to encourage you to be 
bold and post ideas and thoughts that might be interesting regarding 
food, lifestyle changes, really anything somehow tied into making 
good choices (or bad...still can learn from experience)
Rather than just replying to occasional, shout outs for help, and 
our various successes, and I am *sure* with this group and this plan 
being so fantastic, that there will be plenty of those...
How about feeling free to expand on that with non-linear posting 
that may include: recipes we love, reflections on past experiences 
and things which worked for us which could be compatible with a NoS 
life...I love mantras and inspirational stuff... It would make my 
day to wake up, check the posts and find some inspirational quote or 
something similar...I always loved Haiku and fortune cookies stuff :)
You probably noticed that I am becoming quite the poster! Well 
folks, that in itself seems to be helping fortify my willpower 
because through these posts:
1. I am not snacking
2. I am finding help from all of you
3. I am doing something sort of creative, and therefore I am less 
bored and maybe that whole eating out of bordom thing will become a 
problem of the past. Actually it is really fading fast :)

So who is with me on this idea of posting things almost like an 
editorial kind of column, like that post about &quot;No S Menus&quot; geared 

towards our collaborative success? Who knows it may wake up your 
&quot;Inner Julia Child&quot; :)
I will leave you with a great fortune cookie I saved because I loved 
it so much. I put it under my sons baby picture because he is the 
greatest source of love I will ever know.
Use it when you need. 

&quot;The greatest wisdom is kindness&quot;

Good luck No S'er friends, present, past, and future
Love,
Debbie
