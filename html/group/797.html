I have a glass of milk, a banana, a small box of raisins and twelve almonds. almonds 
are suppose to be really good for woman. I cant remember why? But I did read that 
they were.

Hello, 
Have you thought of adding &quot;splenda&quot; to you tea or coffee. 
You can drink sugarless, between meals. Sometimes I enjoy 
&quot;diet rite &quot;pop or diet coke, if I cant find the other, pepppermint tea 
or
decaf coffee....I only allow me caffine before breakfast and just a couple
of cups as I get the shakes and hypoglycemic with too much caffine. I also
get a little shaky with nutrasweet, and try to avoid it as much as possible,
using Splenda if needed.

My plan is to start full swing tomorrow morning. I have already been 
watching my portions and my grazing in the last few weeks but have 
not been so as strict as I should. I know I eat more than I should, 
mostly through grazing. My meals tend to be small so I will have to 
try bigger meals to start off with to curb that need to graze. 
Sweets are not really an issue for me. I will be cutting my coffee 
and tea intake to try to reduce my sugar intake though as i drink at 
least a full pot of both a day (an IV and liquid caffination would 
be much simpler no?) 
Any words of advice to make it through the first day? Food 
suggestions?
