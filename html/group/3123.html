&gt; Dear No S, 
&gt; This doctor is very pro low carb, but very anti sugar, and it 
really surprized me about the Texas schools wanting to grade the 
kids on their BMI!
&gt; Bonnie

....A fat test? Maybe they should focus more on literacy... With 
our own Texan president saying things like &quot;Thank you for my 
reinaugurafication&quot; I am really scared what else may come out of 
that state! (just kidding Mr. Bush, I know you really didn't say 
that!) BMI report card for kids? That is truly ludicrous! How about 
just stressing the importance of exercise and getting rid of the 
snack and soda machines....
This reeks of the &quot;Just say no&quot; campaign during Regan/Bush... How 

about *education and informed choices*! There's a radical thought! 
LOL... I guess it's a good goal, but devoid of good psychology...
Plus, I read this guys articles Bonners...
All respect Bon, seriously this guy seems like an angry charlatan...
Is he even a doctor? Seems like a reactionary's reactionary....
Remember.. He's trying to sell us his book okay....
Still love you bunches though, and feel free to keep on posting 
anything you feel interesting... If not for nothing, as I wrote 
Samurai Allen off list, at least a little controversy keeps our 
wheels a'turning! :)
Love ya Bon, why not give Dr. Andrew Weil a shot... Yes he does 
have lot's of books too, but he seems to really have a good rep as a 
credible source of medical wisdom...
Love,
Deb...
