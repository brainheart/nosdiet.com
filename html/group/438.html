I have yet to find the time to exercise as in exercises as well....But I 

do find ways to get around that. At my work, we have a basement, that I 

occasionally have to go into...I often take one set of stairs down, and 

another up, just for that extra distance of walking...Then I make sure I 

jog them. Other assorted things like that...I try to stand, or pace 
around as much as possible (I'm lucky to not be stuck behind a desk most 

the time.). I suppose I could take the few minutes I'm on the internet 

to go make a shovelglove, or ride the exercise bike in my basement (I 
get in about one ride a week on that), but it really is my time to cool 

down after 13 hours of &quot;work&quot; so I'm not gonna rev myself back 

up....Once summer comes, and I'm not working so much, I'll fit it in. 
ANYWAY, my suggestion is this for the exercise, work it in to your daily 

routine. That'll help with the energy, at least somewhat...trust me on 

that....Days when I do nothing at work, I've been known to take naps in 

my bathroom :)
If it doesn't succeed....DMAE, which is a natural phish oil (often 
powdered) helps alert your brain. I dont' have the info on it infront 
of me, but it activates the creation of colines (I believe I'm correct, 

don't chastise me if I'm wrong) in your brain, which in turn helps clear 

your mind. I took it for a while at one point in my life...All it did 
for me was make me have to pee more. Though MANY people have claimed it 

to be great. It has &quot;side effects&quot; of headaches (I didn't 
get...Supposedly only if you take too much, starting at 100-200mg is 
sufficient), lucid dreams (it helps keep you in the REM state of sleep, 

which is where your brain apparently gets the most rest....Lucid dreams 

can come out of this...Problem with that, is those are easy to wake out 

of) (I did not have any of these, many people claim they have more vivid 

dreams, I was not effected here, though it did help me wake up in the 
morning, the main reason I started taking them, not enough to keep me 
taking them though). There may be other stuff that you could find if 
you look it up...I know WebMD has some stuff on it. Finding it? 
Walgreens carries it, GNC, Vitamin World...Either in the fish oil 
section, or sometimes in the skin care (it's supposed to clear up skin 

as well. Super wonder drug I guess) . It's not expensive for a bottle 
(compaired to bottles of other suppliments). Do I suggest taking it? 
Well, like I said, it didn't help me, but many people I spoke to about 

it (on a internet forum) it helped them alot. If you're desperate, if 
no one else has good advice, give it a shot..I wouldn't suggest going 
out and buying the biggest bottle...And give it a week or two before you 

pass judgement...(though if you're getting headaches, stop...It's not 
worth it)
Good luck!!

&gt;well. Snacking, seconds, sweets. IT's frustrating! I do well for a 

&gt;few days and then I fall. On a much lighter note I have kicked the 

&gt;soda addiction! That S is licked! I'm also still not finding the 
&gt;time to exercise. I am very busy and when I do have 2 seconds to 
&gt;myself I fall asleep because it's the end of the day and I am 
&gt;exhusted! 
&gt; Does anyone know how I can find and energy boosting suppliment that 

&gt;doesn't have ephdra in it? I need an edge and I feel like i'm 
&gt;dragging the second part of the day. Any suggestions?
