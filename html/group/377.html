50 pounds! Ladies and gentlemen, I think we may have a
new champion...

You are absolutely right about treating yourself.
Appetite wants something in return for getting less.

&gt; Hi Portia
&gt; 
&gt; What's helped me through this is, yes to fence
&gt; around the diet, but to give myself good generous
&gt; meals when i sit down to have one. I fill the plate.
&gt; No skimping on the butter either. That way I feel
&gt; satisfied I can have some enjoyment, yet stay within
&gt; the boundaries. 
&gt; 
&gt; I think if we go too extreme it's bound to collapse.
&gt; It's not about deprivation or starvation. It's a
&gt; diet of moderation, that means not getting hung up
&gt; about it. Three tasty proper satisfying meals every
&gt; day. I've slipped loads of times, but I've lost
&gt; nearly 50 pounds since last summer. I'm now within
&gt; the 'normal' weight for my height.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're angry go out and punch something, or
&gt; scream. Eating is how we learned to deal with it as
&gt; kids. We don't have to do that any more. We're
&gt; allowed be angry.
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome back.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is what always happens to me on a diet, and I
&gt; hate it. A few 
&gt; weeks thrilled with it, then a slip, then an extra
&gt; S-day, then a 
&gt; slide, then no fence around the diet, then a
&gt; downward spiral into 
&gt; discouragement. Then a few weeks spent looking
&gt; for the next diet.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sick of it! I love the No-S diet, its
&gt; elegance, its simplicity, 
&gt; its adaptability to anyone's real life. I want to
&gt; return to it. 
&gt; 
&gt; I read about Atkins, that you have one &quot;golden
&gt; chance&quot;, that if you 
&gt; slip and try to return, you won't be successful. 
&gt; You blew it. 
&gt; 
&gt; I refuse to believe it. Certainly my will can
&gt; direct me to any diet 
&gt; I choose. Anyone agree? Anyone deviate from the
&gt; diet and then 
&gt; return to renewed success?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks in advance.
