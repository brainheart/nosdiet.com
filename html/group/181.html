Hi Teresa,
You mentioned that you love to bake goodies around the holidays. I was
thinking that if you got yourself a baking substitute list, then eating 
your
baked goodies won't do so much damage this year.

I'm talking about a list that will tell you that you can substitute
applesauce for butter and the like. I know there are plenty of lists like
that. You could probably find one on the internet or at Amazon.com.

If you can cut the calories and fat in some of your recipes, then you can
still enjoy your baking without feeling too guilty.

My mom always used applesauce in her recipes and there was no sacrifice 
in
taste or texture in her baked goodies.

Here are 2 recipes for imitation icecream. I haven't tried them, yet. But,
I plan to do so, soon. I have my bananas in the freezer ready for me when 
I
get the time. I have heard rave reviews about the taste and texture of
these recipes.

Recipe 1
Take very ripe bananas, peel them, chop them up and place them in a freezer
bag. Freeze solid. Puree in food processor adding a little milk or soymilk
to a creamy consistency. Yummy!


Recipe 2
Blend 4 bananas in the processor
Add	2T unsweetened cocoa powder
1tsp vanilla extract,
2T maple sugar.
Blend till smooth and put in custard cups.
Put in freezer till just frozen (serves 6)

I would think you could add strawberries or other fruit in with the bananas
for a variation of taste. I won't be adding the maple sugar to mine when 
I
make it.


I hope these recipes will help fulfill your cravings for something extra 
to
eat once in a while after dinner without adding the sugar, calories or 
fat.


As for your Father-in-Law... my bet is that he will gain all his weight 
back
and then some. :) His &quot;diet&quot; didn't teach him anything about 
portion
control, healthy choices, rewarding yourself or any other long-term,
way-of-life living habits.

I haven't been doing so well lately and the scales show it. Last night
after a satisfying dinner I still wanted soemthing sweet. I ate an apple
over the course of about an hour and then a handful of raisins. Somewhere
I've got this thing in my head that says after a meal I need something
sweet. Last night hasn't been the only infraction.

Sunday at a restaurant I told my father-in-law about the no &quot;S&quot; diet. 
He
said, &quot;I like the Atkins, I lost 12 pounds.&quot; He went on to elaborate 
that
he only did it for a few weeks a month or so ago, but it worked. I told 
him
no one can maintain such a regimen for too long, and it's too hard, besides
being unhealthy. He shrugged me off.

I don't consider this a &quot;diet&quot; but a lifestyle I must maintain the rest 
of
my life. My brain accepts that, but I also love food. I've never been
really overweight, but there are clothes in my closet I can't wear in
public. I could use a pep talk as the weekend is coming up and the holidays
are right around the corner. Did I mention I love to bake goodies around
the holidays

Teresa
