Hi Dee,

I'm here. It hasn't been that long, by my standards. I
average about half a post a day. It's a trickle, but
reasonably steady... if I did more I'd burn out. And
don't worry, I don't scare easily (on the internet at
least, in person is another story), and you're
perfectly charming, not scary in the least. Sorry
about your recent setbacks. Remember Diane's post from
a while back about how it takes 12 or so attempts on
average for a person to change a habit. Failure, if
you learn from it, is progress. 

In other news:

Amy -- your parable about the lost vacationer captures
the above beautifully. It's not defeatist at all, it's
the opposite. 

Welcome blond Amanda! Thanks too for the old man high
school story. Yes, it would have been wonderful if
we'd started being who we want to be years ago, but
here we are now. Let's be prodigal sons of gluttony
and moderation.

Congratulations Deb on the extra inch! Celebratory
machine gun fire perfectly acceptable.

Julie &amp; daughter (and Deb &amp; Richard) -- I love to hear
these parent/child nos success stories. We need more
of these. I just read another terrifying article in
the times this morning about how this is the first
generation that is going to have a shorter life
expectancy than their parents, because of obesity. I
wish it weren't so, but something has to be done. And
what other diet can you realistically, humanely do
family style?

Nathan - regarding your juicy breakfast, it's hard to
make an absolute call. If you sit in bed all day long,
what you described is probably too much, but
otherwise, and depending on the degree of otherwise,
it sounds pretty wonderful. I drink a fair amount of
grapefruit and orange juice, too. Usually just one
grapefruit at a time, though. I prefer it at room
temperature and sip it slow and airy like red wine. 

Reinhard
