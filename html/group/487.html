In your defense, I think Fat Tuesday qualifies as an &quot;s&quot; day.

&gt; Dear Group,
&gt; Mardi Gras found me eating a Polish Paczki....an extra fat doughnut
&gt; that is very popular on Fat Tuesday, and the sugar was a trigger. Well 
not
&gt; that I shot myself for a couple days back on the wagon again! I know 
for
&gt; sure that I must avoid sugar and nutrasweet, any pop ect. with that 
also.
&gt; Splenda is fine but the other two seem to set off the munchies for me. 
Even
&gt; on S days these are the two things I will swear off. Bonnie

&gt; 
&gt; someone pick me up ?? :-\ 
&gt; 
&gt; Honestly...I added another S...no eating after Supper...okay, it's just 
mine
&gt; but that's the ONLY thing I've kept so far this week. I wonder if 
all
&gt; this snacking and sweets is because of the other S word....Stress. 
My
&gt; brother is coming to stay with our family for undetermined amount of time. 

&gt; 
&gt; I knew I had fallen..and fallen hard when I ate...gulp....a peanut 
butter
&gt; and jelly sandwich **gasp** really....and now I'm sooooooooooooo hungry
&gt; for the munchies. My fruit supply is gone and I need to drink more water. 

&gt; I noticed when I started this change that when I ate good I felt REALLY 
good
&gt; And when you fall into temptation and eat that &quot;M&amp;M left on your 
computer
&gt; desk&quot; that it's really hard to say, &quot;hey it was only an M&amp;M, 
doesn't mean
&gt; you have to eat that bag of *insert favourite food here*. Which, well 
I'm
&gt; prone to do a lot more, here a nibble there a nibble so it doesn't 
&quot;Seem&quot; as
&gt; much, but in the end (like the one I'm sitting on) it all adds up. Right? 

&gt; 
&gt; I always keep in the back of my mind, tomorrow is another day. ( so 
eat
&gt; more and start over then *jk*) But really, how long will this &quot;binge&quot; 
go
&gt; on? Is there any hope for us who lay by the roadside wading in our
&gt; chocolate syruped mudpuddles? 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I've babbled, I'll return you to your previous programming. 

&gt; 
&gt; Pal...pondering how fast she can catch up to the wagon
