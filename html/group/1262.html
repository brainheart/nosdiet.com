Hi Everyone

I have been a member of the group for several months, and reading 
your posts with interest, and trying to get my habits around the No S 
idea. Thank you for sharing, it is so helpful. And thank you 
Reinhard, for your systems and your clear thinking.

As soon as I read your system (referred to it by Stephen Downes) my 
brain knew it was correct, spot on, and brilliant in its simplicity.

My habits and diet mentality indoctrination had other ideas.

BUT ............

I have done two days of No S, and its 8.30 on Saturday and I have had 
2 glasses of warm water with lemon juice. 

I followed one of your posts, Reinhard (R), that said start towards 
the end of the week for the first time.

I also used the wait till Sat and Sun .... and that worked, but it is 
interesting that I haven't rushed off to the patisserie, and my 
breakfast yoghurt is waiting for me.

Needless to say, I have tried a number of times, and not succeeded. 
It took some time to truly embrace the simplicity. As well as 
undertaking No S, I was importing all sort of other rules (good ones 
re healthy eating). Now this isn't bad, and I think I will get to 
that point more often than not, but in terms of building the new 
habits you talk of R, it isn't helpful.

This time I was at the point where I could congratulate myself for 
sitting down at the table and eating scalloped potatoes and 
hamburgers (and omigod I also added some lightly cooked spinach). No 
guilt, in fact praise, and sitting down and thoroughly chewing and 
enjoying this food.

Evenings are hardest for me. When I am at work doing breakfast and 
lunch isn't so hard. I used to have my fruit as a snack in the 
morning and afternoon, but didn't even do that. I was bearning in 
mind what you say R about the discipline and habit. So while eating 
fruit, or other nutritious snacks probably isn't bad, it is not good 
at all for the habit building. This dynamic has been interesting for 
me to observe in myself. I have always thought I had no discipline, 
control .... but through No S I am discovering that isn't true. That 
is so nice to discover. The diet mentality has so much to answer for 
in the psychological destruction it causes.

So for me, evenings have been touch. What I have added, is to chew 
(not swallow) some sugarless type chewing gum. That seems to have 
helped the with what I have realised is the need to feel something in 
my mouth.

R when you say sometimes, when you are answering questions or 
responding to people's difficulties, oh, this is in the system 
description .... do keep saying it again. I have found it very 
helpful to have a certain aspect of the system restated, and 
sometimes put in a slightly different way. So please keep talking 
with us, even if it seems a bit repetitive to you. 

You are essential. What is allowing me to take the leap of faith is 
my belief in what you say. I believe this will work, you have 
convinced me that No S along with Urban Ranger and Shovel Push will 
WORK. So once this belief comes and the concepts internalised, it is 
possible to sit down to the meal I described above without guilt, and 
in fact with a good feeling. This is truly special for a long term 
dieter - and is the beginning of a mentally and physically healthy 
life. This is a big thing for a grossly obese 40 yo, who has been 
close to despair in the last few years.

Go Reinhard :)) I am your next and greatest fan.

I adore your systems, and will write more about that in the everyday 
systems group. This post has turned out to be quite a lot more than I 
intended. But it was important for me to say and share ..... I seem 
to have been focussing on R a lot group, but I thank you all very 
much too. Being brave enough to share you journey to healthiness is 
great ...... I will from now on share my downs as well as the ups.

very best wishes to us all

Jen
