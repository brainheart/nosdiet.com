but today, i thk all of them are equally hard. i m taking more and
more sweet stuff, natural it may be but still...

Lucily I don't drink coffee, ever since the first time i tried it when
i was alittle kid, many many years ago. After reading your mail, i
have resolute to go out n get some carrots and beet roots and apples
to make a salad.

But thanks for the positive reinforcement. I will work on it bit by
bit, hopefully i can get to the BIT stage! will power -&gt; better
habit. way to go!

I need alot of peer support. So pl keep your feedback coming!

I can't say I am already there, but I am getting better. Just
remember to tell yourself you don't have to be perfect you just have
to be better. Just remember with the whole habit thing, NoS is'nt
about willpower versus habit it's about using your willpower to change
bad habits into better habits. Just remember if you have a HABIT and
you get rid of part you still have ABIT. If you get rid of still more
you still have that BIT you can get rid of even more but you still
have IT. So exchange the HABIT for something else. If drinking the
honey water is a problem on No S days just drink water. Save all
sweets even if they are natural sweets for your S days. If your a
coffee drinking I can not advise you on that one I have never touched
the stuff myself. I did read somewhere though, the enzymes in a
single apple have the same wake-up power of 2 or more cups of coffee.
I can not judge that to be true but it does perk me up to have an
apple with my breakfast or lunch when I am really dragging. Best of
luck to you. Your friend in health Melanie

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I m new here. But i really like the noSdiet system. Because it is 

&gt; something I tried n tried to do but alas,... 
&gt; 
&gt; Will power vs habits
&gt; 
&gt; My version: will power + some distraction + some &quot;I am very full now&quot; 

&gt; + don't start eating + drink diluted soya or honey water.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it playing games with the mind, play it not a day, two days. A 

&gt; life time?! 
&gt; 
&gt; Or it is changing habits so we don't need to play games anymore?
&gt; 
&gt; For those who are already there, pl enlighten me! Struggling alone is 

&gt; no fun!
