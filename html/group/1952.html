&gt; Hi everyone. I was posting here a few months ago and following=20
NoS for a couple of weeks. I love NoS and have told so many people=20
about it!! I just returned from a cruise and decided prior to the=20
cruise to go on one last `quick-fix' diet to drop a few extra pounds=20
rather quickly. I did that and now the cruise is over (wonderful,=20
wonderful time) and I am back to NoS.=20=20
&gt;=20
&gt;=20=20
&gt;=20
&gt; I have done many diets in the past =96 Weight Watchers (lifetime=20
member), Atkins, Scarsdale, Slimfast, Formula, the Zone. I am tired=20
of either being ON A DIET or ON A BINGE! I really don't know a=20
happy medium and really, truly believe that NoS is just what I=20
need. It provides just the right boundaries without being so=20
restrictive that I am either starving or craving. I know that any=20
food I want is never more than 5 days away.=20=20=20
&gt;=20
&gt;=20=20
&gt;=20
&gt; I did weigh myself this morning and gained ONLY 5 pounds on the=20
cruise =96 this included 3 days in New Orleans and 5 days on the=20
ship. I ate and drank practically around the clock =96 so 5 pounds is=20
a blessing. I know the pounds will not fall off like they did with=20
Scarsdale, but I also know that I am giving up all the mind games I=20
had to play to stick with diets in the past.=20=20
&gt; WOW- thats impressive. I have needed new clothes after a cruise:)
Good for you, just jump back in the game of Nos and we will all be=20
here for you. I hate the restrictiveness of diets and all the rules.=20
Who can remember them all. Which is why i love NOS. Good luck Julie
&gt;=20=20
&gt;=20
&gt; I am hoping to post here often and will let you know how my first=20
days go. I am going to use the RED SLASH method of marking off my=20
calendar to measure my success.
