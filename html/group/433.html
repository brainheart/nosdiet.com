Dear no S,
I have a Suisse friend who lives in France that says to lose weight do
the no P diet, in French that stands for Potatoes Pastries, bread (Pain)
Pasta. But she is a fine weight as all my European friends. They do eat 
less
and exercise more. I lived in the French part of Switzerland for 10 years
and was always a little underweight! And mostly because of no Snacking, 
not
many Sweets, except chocolate upon occasion, fruit type dessert, and if 
it
had crust I never eat pie crust,makes me sick. So what I am saying is that
it was like the no S diet without even being on any diet because I was
without an extra ounce of weight.
And yes, we would exercise, walking , swimming at the school pool, I was 
in
my late twenties and early thirties,so all was easy, granted, but it can
work for sure. Keep no Essing,
Bonnie

Ah, but think of the enormous disadvantage non-English
speakers suffer since they can't do no-s... (doesn't
always translate so well).

Seriously, it's astonishing how many contradictory
studies there are in the field of human diet and
nutrition. My suspicion is that when you filter out
the random noise, the most significant advantage
people in healthier societies have is 1) they eat less
2) they move more. It is interesting to note that they
tend to do both of these without conscious diet or
exercise plans. While we're too far gone for that,
it's important to bear in mind. A successful system
should *seem* more like a habit or tradition (or a
useful activity) than a system, once you're used to
it, at least.

&gt; For those of you who watch what you eat...Here's the
&gt; final word on nutrition
&gt; and health. It's a relief to know the truth after
&gt; all those conflicting
&gt; medical studies.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer
&gt; heart attacks than the
&gt; Americans.
&gt; 2. The Mexicans eat a lot of fat and suffer fewer
&gt; heart attacks than the
&gt; Americans.
&gt; 3. The Japanese drink very little red wine and
&gt; suffer fewer heart attacks
&gt; than the Americans
&gt; 4. The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine
&gt; and suffer fewer heart
&gt; attacks than the Americans.
&gt; 5. The Germans drink a lot of beers and eat lots of
&gt; sausages and fats and
&gt; suffer fewer heart attacks than the Americans.
&gt; 
&gt; CONCLUSION: Eat and drink what you like. Speaking
&gt; English is apparently what
&gt; kills you.
