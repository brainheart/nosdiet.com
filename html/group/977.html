I agree with you mygoal. The simplicity of NOS is what makes us keep 
trying, sticking to or coming back to it. I know I really can't 
incorporate another diet into it. I've been there, that is why I am 
here.

&gt; to respond to cat's question a couple days ago, i've averaged about 

&gt; a pound a week so far. like someone else was mentioning, it's been 

&gt; a sort of two steps forward, one step back process so far.
&gt; 
&gt; i must have missed something with all this low-carb talk. it seems 

&gt; to me that adding low-carb to no-s is making the process much 
harder 
&gt; than it needs to be. unless a person already eats very reasonably 

&gt; (i would assume that person would already be at an ideal weight and 

&gt; have little need for diets) following the no-s diet will certainly 

&gt; lead to weight loss, and it allows for eating carbs, protein, and 

&gt; fat in a proportion that tastes and feels normal. i would think 
&gt; that adding further restrictions would just make it more difficult 

&gt; to stick with, and more difficult to achieve permanent results.
