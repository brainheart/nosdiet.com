Hi Guys, am I on a major adrenaline rush!
Again the freaking scale &quot;siren&quot; was calling my name, only to crash 

on the rocks again! I was up 1 or 2 lbs, who really knows, but that 
is all over now...I decided that this girl needs some tough love1
I was going to throw the scale out my window, but as I got up to 
open it, I saw my trusty shovelglove in the corner of my eye and 
found the inspiration I needed to do a very productive, and &quot;useful&quot; 

movement...
I took the $40 scale out, which has been &quot;costing&quot; me way more than 

this, these days, to the backyard, peeked around to see if any 
mental hospital police might be lurking in my yard (they are 
everywhere, just waiting for me! LOL) and took a great big step 
backwards, planted my feet firmly on Gods good soil, and hit the 
thing like there was no tomorrow!!!!!
It won't have the final word on my state of mind anymore! Not one 
more peep out of that torture machine :)
It is completely flattened and has no more number dial to look at!!!
Then I took it upstairs into my room, and hung it on my wall as a 
trophy and an homage to my new empowerment! Guess what folks? 
There is nothing inside that scale...Behind that dial of numbers it 
is an empty fuckin box!
I feel like The Donald and I just told my least productive part of 
my team &quot;YOUR FUCKIN FIRED!&quot;
Wow! You should all try this...I am totally stoked! So, if you 
people think I am crazy, you are probably right, no secret there, 
LOL!...But my heart is pounding still, and I am really happy I did 
it!
(sorry for my excessive descriptive language, but getting good and 
angry is healthy sometimes! And I only hurt an empty metal box made 
in China)
Of course I was playing some live Dead to accompany this feat of 
power! Maybe Led Zep would have been better, but you know me, 
Deadhead forever :)
I FU*#$'N Rock!!!!
Love,
Deb
