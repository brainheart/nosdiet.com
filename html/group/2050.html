I am reluctantly reporting in. I fell off the wagon veteran's day 
and had quite the 4 days. I feel physically awful -- sluggish and 
plump. What did I expect to happen? Well, I am back on track 
today. It is amazing how good you can feel when you treat your 
body better. 

....Hi *Lee*, :)
It's great that you are re-resolved...I am feeling totally 
physically exhausted and uncomfortable in my body today because I 
have my &quot;.&quot;
I agree that when you treat you body &quot;better&quot;, your mind follows and 

it makes for a &quot;happy circle&quot; rather than a &quot;vicious&quot; 
one...
Hey if we only fall off the wagon once in a while, as opposed to 
living that way every day, minimal damage will occur and it's 
reversable...Keep plugging away, and tweak the system to fit your 
needs...I am realizing that I don't drink enough water, and I have 
been not eating too many filling salads.... Also, when I stop 
exercising, forget it, this diet only works for me if I stay 
consistently active....I am knee deep in my cycle right now, so I 
think it would be self torture to weigh myself, but I know that I am 
up in weight...By the end of the week I'll check in on that...
All in all, even though I'm really at a weight standstill, I 
wouldn't consider any other plan...You watch, we will all succeed!
I am totally confident in that. I will say, that after not eating 
this for years, I had a craving last week for some bacon, and on one 
of my S days, I had a large Coke Slurpee...NoS diet approved or not, 
they weren't helpful to my weight situation...Okay, so now that I've 
had them (certainly the bacon I could live without, and so could my 
arteries and blood pressure, but, hey, bacon and eggs rocked last 
weekend!) I will really focus on making very healthy diet 
choices...No need to go anal about it, and start chewing 84 times, 
and keeping a strict log, but hey, in general, I could stand to cut 
down on cheese and skip the Slurpees. I actually did better, when I 
was eating 1 chocolate Haagen Daz bar a week, go figure...Sodas are 
a caloric killer! So even though it's not restricted on S days, 
it's simply not working for me and I want to win!
Okay, that's enough...I feel so blech today...People let's all say a 
little prayer that this week is a good one for all! :)
Love and Peace
Deb
