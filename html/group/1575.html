&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; i have noticed that lots of people are reporting a weight at 3 

weeks of NOS...is this stardard time to weigh,, 

Hi Donna :)
The three weeks in are, in terms of No S Diet, that period of time 
which is supposed to be the &quot;hump&quot; we must cross till the new habits 

really kick in...Many people have had difficulty staying completely 
on program during this period and it is the part of No S which 
requires the most behavioral changes &quot;up front&quot;
But weighing in is not specifically &quot;recommended&quot; or encouraged at 

the end of this three weeks...We all have different personal goals 
and some people feel happy weighing once a month, once a week....
If you look at Reinhards original experiences while developing No S, 
he didn't even weigh himself until about two months into the process.
You didn't miss anything. Set a realistic goal for yourself and try 
to use your scale as a once in a while reality check...If you stick 
with this method, over time, as long as you compliment it with 
moderate exercise, you will lose weight...Slowly, but at a healthy 
rate, and you will be forming habits which will last a lifetime.
Are you new?
Good luck :) 
Debbie
I am 37 and have been on NoS for a month.
I need to lose about 50 to 60 lbs...so far my weight went like this 
with No S, and I am kindof slowing down due to having a bad virus 
the last 10 days, which threw off my exercise.
1st week 215lbs (major change in eating, plus alot of water weight)
2nd week 207lbs 
3rd (pms) 210lbs (3lbs easily put on during menstrual cycle)
4th week 209lbs I am fine with this :)

Net loss 6 lbs...Goal,,keeping it off and easing back into some 
exercise once I have full energy back and am over this bloody cold.

I will *probably* weigh myself around 2xs a month, but it is subject 
to change depending on my general mood and outlook...If I feel awful 
I don't need to &quot;rub it in&quot; with the frickin scale, so I only weigh 

myself when I am feeling good and I know the results won't rock my 
world...
