Dear Debbie
How true about eating sugar, wanting sugar and for dessert more sugar. 
It
drives me crazy having to serve ice cream all summer, but we started years
ago when I was slimmer and fortunately it is the only Sugar I love. I never
was one for pastries nor cakes.
My son sings and plays guitar, and composes. One of my brothers sings and 
is
an art teacher and an artist in MA. My other brother plays guitar a little,
and is an artist, and has been a hippie professor at Berkely since the 
60's.
He is semi retired now, but still a hippie, in the graphics business. My 
Mom
and sister and my daughter are painters, and so am I and I was a bit of 
a
hippie type back in the 70's as was my younger sister. So we are an artistic
family, but my son does not paint, all his efforts are music, and I love 
it.
The only thing is only my Mom had the weight problem, and not til after 
age
50 like me. I feel they think &quot;What happened to her, can't she control
herself&quot; Maybe not, but that was always my attitude towards some of 
my
husbands family members, many of who were overweight. Now I am one, but 
dont
plan to stay this way much longer, making every effort.
Bonnie
