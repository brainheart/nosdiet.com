&gt; Hi Sheila, just wondering how the week is going for you,been 
following your post and am rooting for you for June. Keep reading 
and posting you wild woman ! Dont forget to plan for a sweet this 
weekend.Thats the beauty of this EP is that you get rewarded not 
only by losing weight, having people cheer you on, feeling better, 
but every weekend you get to sss a little if you want.I find if i 
dont then its harder to start fresh on MOnday. I dont over do it by 
any means, my personal addiction is Starbuck FF caramel macchiato.I 
lay in wait for saturday for my treat. I pass SB everyday, so its a 
visual reminder i will get one on saturday but not today !:) I al 
slowly cutting my addiction to coffee, and have conquered the pepsi 
addiction, so am on a roll. So anyway, welcome &amp; have fun taking 
control of your eating and losing the bulge(as deberoo put it so 
aptly)TTYL Julie
&gt; It's marvelous finding like-minded people who sound so sane.
&gt; 
&gt; I got thru my first weekend, having to remind myself to let up 
just 
&gt; a bit, like I had an orange between lunch and dinner, and a plate 

of 
&gt; salad before my main course! Wild woman!
&gt; 
&gt; People are telling me I look better. Have a great week, 
everyone.You 
&gt; are all looking good to me.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sheila

&gt; &gt; &gt; Time to go un-incognito... 
&gt; &gt; .....Hey nice that you are now cognito Sheila, welcome and 
&gt; congrats 
&gt; &gt; on your first week :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I knew immediately that this is the answer!!!!For life!!!! It's 

&gt; like 
&gt; &gt; finding your soulmate... you can't find the right one until 
you're 
&gt; &gt; ready, 
&gt; &gt; ......That's excellent! Your enthusiasm is well warranted and I 

&gt; &gt; feel the same.. It's an instantaneous &quot;click&quot; in the brain with 

&gt; NoS 
&gt; &gt; reasoning.. very clear, no BS.... the &quot;Diet of our dreams!&quot; 

Tall 
&gt; &gt; dark and something we want to be with and no resentment for 
&gt; secrets 
&gt; &gt; and baggage.. it's an honest, intelligent and respectful 
partner :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;I also have a June goal -- I don't wanna turn 50 and be fat! I 

&gt; &gt; think I can handle a 20 lb. weight loss during the next four 

&gt; months, 
&gt; &gt; don't you think?
&gt; &gt; .....You can do it Sheila!!!! You are armed for the battle of 

&gt; &gt; the &quot;bulge&quot; LOL :)
&gt; &gt; Good luck to you...
&gt; &gt; Deb
