Hi Deb,

Good question. My rule is (to violate a registered
trademark) that if it's a &quot;soup that eats like a
meal,&quot; then that's your plate. Example: a big old
lentil or pea soup with hocks of ham. Especially if
you've got bread and what not on the side. If it's a
more retrained soup, then use the &quot;virtual fruit&quot;
rule: eat the soup in a separate bowl but just make
sure to adjust your subsequent portions accordingly,
either use a smaller plate or leave a patch of plate
clear. 

The &quot;virtual fruit&quot; rule:

&quot;Strict doesn't
necessarily mean putting the fruit on same physical
plate (that's a little barbarous) but it means
reducing your other portions so that it *could* fit on
your plate.&quot;

From:

<a href="http://nosdiet.com/group/698">http://nosdiet.com/group/698</a>

Have trouble imagining how much space a &quot;virtual soup&quot;
should take up? Imagine it frozen. Can't handle it?
Then I'm afraid I'm going to have to advise fence
around the law literalism. But I can't imagine this
should be much of a problem for most people.

&gt; Hi Reinhard and all :)
&gt; I know that No S is supposed to be flexible yet
&gt; strict on some basic 
&gt; rules...I think I have encountered an everyday
&gt; problem, which as the 
&gt; months get cooler, will become even more &quot;everyday&quot;
&gt; (esp with flu 
&gt; season etc...)
&gt; Here's my little conundrum...I like to have soup for
&gt; lunch or 
&gt; dinner, along with either a salad or sandwich...This
&gt; is not 
&gt; something I can do using the &quot;One physical plate&quot;
&gt; rule...Okay, maybe 
&gt; I have to give up soup, or just combine my salad and
&gt; soup (boy would 
&gt; that be messy)
&gt; Help me Reinhard or anyone else...I really don't
&gt; want to cheat this 
&gt; system...Is there any loophole or provision for
&gt; soup? Or do I have 
&gt; to adhere to a fourth, NO S &quot;Fence&quot; law, &quot;No
&gt; S...oup&quot;, in order to 
&gt; adhere to the 3 Commandments of No S?
&gt; If the answer is, to make the portion really smaller
&gt; on one of the 
&gt; two courses, I will do this...
&gt; Soup to me is very filling and comforting, but I
&gt; don't want to fool 
&gt; myself into thinking that this is ok, unless
&gt; approved from a &quot;higher 
&gt; authority&quot; :)
&gt; Fondly,
&gt; Debbie
&gt; PS FYI...The &quot;Fence&quot; Laws are the extra rules in
&gt; Orthodox Judaism, 
&gt; which are the first line of defense to protect
&gt; against breaking any 
&gt; of the over 600 Biblical Laws...EG: One of the
&gt; Biblical Laws 
&gt; is &quot;Thou Shalt Not Cook a Calf in Her Mothers Milk&quot;,
&gt; in order to 
&gt; ensure that no one break this rule, a &quot;Fence&quot; rule
&gt; was created later 
&gt; which states that one shouldn't eat meat with dairy,
&gt; then it 
&gt; eliminates the rare possibility of boiling a child
&gt; in it's own 
&gt; mothers milk, a gruesome idea to be sure...I really
&gt; never even 
&gt; understood this rule of keeping dairy and meat
&gt; separate until I 
&gt; looked into the whole &quot;Fence Laws&quot; explanation...I
&gt; wasn't raised 
&gt; orthodox, but I do really love Chicken Soup :) Okay
&gt; so there's the 
&gt; info on Fence Laws which are there so as not to
&gt; break those original 
&gt; Biblical Laws from, I think mainly, the Book of
&gt; Deuteronomy...I am 
&gt; not Kosher, but I do want to keep &quot;kosher&quot; with No S
&gt; :)
