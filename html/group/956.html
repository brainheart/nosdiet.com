 Dear Reinhard and Fellow No Esses,
Due to going too wild on the weekends, starting on Fri noons, as that
is when my friend and I go out to lunch and begins the weekend with my
afternoon off with an art class....so 
I tried to say, well I shall be &quot;good&quot; on Sunday, but with owning an 
ice
cream store and Sun. being the biggest day for me selling my very favorite
and my &quot;got to have a Sundae on Sunday rule&quot; my no S days were becoming 
3,
so last Sunday I decided No Sugar period. As I am hypoglycemic, and sugar
makes me crave more, this is the best approach, s day or not.
A nd three days later I have lost 4 pounds. It shall follow with the rest 
of
the No S rules....Seconds is no problem, but Snacks is almost as bad as
sugar. But my first kill is no sugar....mainly my big love affair with 
ice
cream, so that is worling. I found a low carb choc. milk, with Splenda in 
it
that I enjoy if I really must have a sweet dairy or Frozen Yougart, No 
sugar
kind, is fine also, as part of the meal. Next week I will work more on 
the
snacks, but like the other fellow no Esser who wrote in about one S at 
a
time,
This is a better approach for me too, and I only have one more S to control
now!
Bonnie

Congratulations, Lee! Hang in there. Even if I don't
respond to every post, know that I'm reading with
great interest (I'd say &quot;suspense,&quot; but I have
confidence in you).

Drinks are fine whenever (except sugar-soda). You
should go out of your way to drink as much water or
low/no calorie beverage as possible. While I wouldn't
recommend drinking gallons a day, I don't worry about
fruit juice or milk either (don't kid yourself, they
are very caloric, small glasses are probably best).

Good luck on day 3,

Reinhard

&gt; Day 2 of starting over. Doing good. My weight is
&gt; up but I know it
&gt; is from all the bad eating I have done previously so
&gt; I won't panic.
&gt; I am actually 2 lbs heavier than when I first
&gt; started so I better
&gt; eally watch it this time a stick to the rules.
&gt;
&gt; I have a question regarding having a drink or 2.
&gt; Does it have to be
&gt; with a meal? or can it be by itself?
&gt;
&gt; I don't feel as hungry tonight as I did last night
&gt; at this time.
