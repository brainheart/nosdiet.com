Just to let you know that we're not a bunch of saints, I had two Krispy Kreme donuts 

today! Today was the last day for one of my coworkers. We had a bunch of donuts 

and ice-cream cake at our group meeting. So, I made it an S-day. I think it's OK 

because I didn't get to do too much S-ing on the 4th of July weekend.

Angie, my sample diet, like Reinhard's, was a bit abnormal. I usually don't eat like 

that. Still, I do try to limit my greasy/fried foods. That's mainly because I didn't 
grow 
up with it. So, even though it's quite tasty, I try to resist. Also, I tend to feel 
much 
more satisfaction with myself (maybe not my stomach) when I eat lots of fresh 
foods.

Best of luck! I won't be around next week. I look forward to hearing about other 

peoples' progress in a week.

Justin

&gt; All right folks, I've read through your sample diets, and I'm 
&gt; wondering where the heck you all live, lol!!! I'm living in the 
&gt; south, and as you can imagine, there are a whole lot of fried foods 

&gt; on my monthly family menu plan. I'm still trying to cut down, had 

&gt; lost 10 lbs, but traveled unexpectedly 2 weeks straight, so I have 

&gt; to start over. Wahhh. Does anyone here have young children, and if 

&gt; so do you have any de-sugaring suggestions for them? -Angie
