Welcome, Cathy.

As far as I know, the current record holder has lost
50 pounds, I've lost 40. Could you lose more? I can't
guarantee it, but I don't see why not. The system has
only been around for 3 years, for 1 of which I was
pretty much the only person on it, so there's not a
plethora of empirical evidence (see the post count by
month on the groups home page to get a more nuanced
sense of this). But if you look at it another way,
there *is* a large body of evidence: it models the way
healthy people eat in traditional societies. Billions
of thin people stay thin on a fixed number of meals a
day, no or minimal snacking, and occasional festive
excesses. It's what the touted French diet,
mediterranean diet, okinawa diet and more have in
common. Nobody except some hypothetical cave man and
arctic nomads ever ate low carb.

You say this looks like something you can stick with.
That's critical, because if you can stick with it, I'm
*very* confident it'll work. Sticking with it is the
whole trick. The diet is geared towards being as easy
as possible and pleasant to stick with, but don't kid
yourself, it still takes work. I haven't heard from
anyone who followed the rules strictly for &gt; 3 weeks
and didn't see results. Big plates etc. are more
boogiemen than actual problems.

Try slashing out &quot;days on habit&quot; on a calendar until
you hit three weeks. Much easier than keeping track of
carbs, calories, etc.

Looking forward to hearing more from you,

Reinhard

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Oddly enough I discovered the No-S diet through a
&gt; South Beach diet
&gt; community on Live Journal. While reading over the
&gt; details of the No-S
&gt; diet I thought &quot;Now here's a plan I could stick to&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; However, I need to lose a lot of weight, about a 100
&gt; lbs. I've been
&gt; reading through some posts and I haven't seen any
&gt; from other people
&gt; who need to lose as much weight as I do. I was
&gt; wondering if the diet
&gt; works for people like me or if it's geared more
&gt; towards people who
&gt; only need to drop 10, 20, or 30 lbs. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am just tired of avoiding carbs and counting
&gt; points. I need to find
&gt; a low maintenance diet where I don't have to deprive
&gt; myself of my
&gt; favorite foods. 
&gt; 
&gt; -Cathy
