&gt; HI Beth,

Julie here, there is really nothing wrong with eating when one 
gets hungry and stopping when satisfied- ive been doing that for 
many years.First started soing that on Weigh Down. which is the main 
gist of that diet.and the only 2 rules. it works quite well actually.
But also entailed much journaling and self examination of why we 
over eat and go to food to fill our needs instead of God.
Listen girl we have all fallen off each and every diet we have ever 
started and it was big of you to admit it to all of us. i never 
would for sure.:)
Sometimes it takes a major fall for a person to realize that they 
are not perfect never will be and they are exactly how God made them 
to be. you being 4'11 is great- i love petite clothes, though i cant 
wear them at 5'6 :) and I envy you being able to get out and do the 
things you love to do exercise wise ! sounds like a lot of fun. The 
important thing is you are doing something for you and you alone !
As women we often forget to take care of ourselves because we are so 
busy taking care of others needs above our own.
I dont think any of us wants to be skin and bones just healthy, full 
of energy and able to do what we want to do in life !and to be happy 
most of all.So go for it !
Scale wise i agree with you, and really the way my clothes fit me is 
more of a gage than the scale. 
Not really sure how long you were on NOs before or if you actually 
started it or not. I remember seeing your name once in a while..
Weight loss would be a nice side affect- i have lost 8 since Jan. 
1st.and you can too if you follow the rules. Mind you i have been on 
NOs since October and there were many months i lost nothing but just 
tackled the problem areas one at a time. That is why it is easier 
now i guess. This EP made me realize i had alot of bad habits not 
just the three listed LOL. so one S at a time if you have to. 
whatever works for you. 
And yet I am not satisfied with that as i too would like it to be 
faster, as i have 37# to go to goal weight. but what i do know is i 
feel slimmer, clothes fit better and i am doing my best i can do 
every day. 
The one reason i like this ep is that it is reasonable, unlike so 
many diet plans out there.
Just a few simple suggestions for you that might help or may not i 
dont know really.
1)Get rid of the sweets in your home- your kids can live with out 
them too as can your husband if there is one..Like Rein says be 
comically strict with yourself.I say no sugar will pass these lips 
except on S days and only if they are really really great ! I dont 
even want a candy bar anymore- i mean its got to be really good.
2)Drink your water- not because you have to but because its good for 
you, helps you destress, and apparently ice water increses your 
metabolism or so &quot;they&quot; say. whoever they is ?
3) Take it one day at a time- forget the three week goals and such, 
we can only live one day at a time so why make unrealistic goals for 
ourselves only to break them and feel bad about ourselves again and 
again.
4) Try to do something good for yourself everyday it will make you 
feel better about yourself which will increase your self esteem !


and remember most of all we are all here for you- dont worry about 
reporting weight loss or gains. we are here for support- there are
some great people here and a few crazys too. LOL. 

BTW- whoever has told you that being 4&quot;11 means you can only eat 1-2 

times a day is full of you know what !!! i have no idea what your 
weight is but i ahve seen 4&quot;11 people put down the food and not gain 

any weight and then i jsut the opposite- tyou jsut cant put people 
in those categories0- we are all so very different in our daily 
needs, so forget about what those quacks say gf.. you are smarter 
than that. or you would still be on there quack diets !

well darling you ahve a wonderful NOS day- remembering that tomorrow 
is an S day- and according to our rules you can have sweets if you 
want them. 

Julie
