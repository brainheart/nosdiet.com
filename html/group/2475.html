Ive recently come across Reinard's interesting websites, and in 
particular, this one. So this is my first posting, apologies if 
these questions have been posed before, I couldnt spot them after a 
cursory glance through the archive.

First some words of thanks and praise.

Reinhard's NOS is a great approach and seems eminently sensible.

A couple of things occur to me that the rest of you may have 
opinions on. Reinhard suggests that everything you eat should be 
piled onto ONE plate, even if it looks a trifle bestial at first.

A) what size plate are we talking about here? seemingly trivial, but 
plates come in all shapes and sizes. If you start off with a big 
one, you may be taking into too many calories, and it'll be diffcult 
to cut down if you get used to a jumbo sized one. If it's too small, 
you arent going to stick to what's there. Perhaps you stomach should 
dictate the plate size? ie let your tum tell you when youre full? 
Mmmm, maybe not a good idea either, doing this has created the 
existing bulges. The correct answer, of course, is the plate size 
that encourages you to lose weight, so I'm back full circle here, 
since I wont know that until Ive lost a bit....I'd be interested to 
hear what others, who have just ventured onto this diet have 
discovered.

B) Does EVERYTHING have to go on one plate? What about soup? Does 
this count as your one plate? Or can you have this as a starter?
Presumably fruit doesnt count. Including calorie laden stuff like 
bananas? OK, maybe one wont hurt, but a bunch of thenm certainly 
would. And we all know how cunning the subconcious mind can be about 
getting round the &quot;rules&quot; of any dieting system.

For what its worth, one thing I've defintely found that helps with 
weight control is journalling. Writing down what you eat (though a 
tad tedious at times) bring into you conscious awareness just what 
and how much youre munching. Definitely recommended (at least to 
start with) if you do it in a non-judgemental way. 

One last thing. I wouldnt wish to deny Reinhard any well deserved 
loot made from the sale of NOS mugs etc, but I just hope if he 
becomes a billionaire that it doesnt affect his writing style, or 
more importantly, his no-nonsense approach to weight control, 
shovelgloves, or any other interesting low-cost ideas he dreams up.

Festive Greetings to all and particular thanks to Reinhard
Ceri
