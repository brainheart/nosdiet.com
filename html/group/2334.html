OK, let's cool it. I'm willing to believe no one meant
any harm so far, let's please keep it so I can
continue to believe this. I propose we end this thread
here.

Moderately,

Reinhard

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone
&gt; &gt; Marianne here in Germany
&gt; &gt; I have been a silent observer for several months
&gt; now - some of the 
&gt; comments are really amusing, some people seem to be
&gt; quite enamored 
&gt; with their socalled literary creativity
&gt; 
&gt; ....Gee, everyones a literary critic! LOL :)Just
&gt; trying to keep the 
&gt; conversation &quot;socalled&quot; lively...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was hoping you would see your error- here this
&gt; gal was all 
&gt; excited and you really slammed her 
&gt; 
&gt; .....This is why I wrote my apology, however, I will
&gt; say, 
&gt; that &quot;slam&quot; is a bit extreme... I went into a
&gt; negative place, but I 
&gt; also offered some kind comments, not in my opinion,
&gt; a total &quot;slam&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I know what I am talking about, believe me - so I
&gt; am glad you have 
&gt; corrected yourself and now carry on....
&gt; &gt; Marianne
&gt; 
&gt; ....Pardon me Mariane, I seem to have offended you
&gt; more than little 
&gt; ol'Jeanette (and again Jeanette, feel free to tell
&gt; me I am a big 
&gt; poopie pants for that first &quot;dumb letter&quot; I'll say
&gt; it again, it was 
&gt; an unthoughtful comment and I'm sorry it even got
&gt; posted! Mea 
&gt; Culpa!! :)
&gt; I *will* continue to &quot;carry on&quot; and would have
&gt; anyway... I am an 
&gt; unstoppable force! LOL :) I will end this letter
&gt; saying that two 
&gt; wrongs don't make a right....If you feel happier now
&gt; that I have 
&gt; been scolded, for my &quot;slamming&quot; and &quot;socalled
&gt; literary&quot; writing, 
&gt; then I'm glad it's off your chest...
&gt; It is easy to judge others...I realized that on my
&gt; own, thank you 
&gt; very much...I can only be an authority on my own
&gt; feelings, and not 
&gt; other peoples...I also believe in forgiveness and
&gt; compassion when 
&gt; someone makes a mistake...I corrected myself and
&gt; said I was 
&gt; sorry.....
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Debbie
