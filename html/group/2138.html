--- ...Hey Hana, hope you don't mind... I lifted that &quot;tyranny&quot; word 

out and used it in one of my Shovelglove posts...See, the British 
use of English is oh so flavorful! :) Yes scales are definitely 
tyrranical! But mine isn't anymore! Hee hee hee :) Sucker! LOL

......Wow, I have heard of this interesting and unusual phenomenon, 
where the dogs and the owners begin to look alike! But so far you 
are the first person I have known to openly admit wanting to look 
like one :) LOL Well that just shows your pure love for the 
puppies :)
Did you ever see a movie called &quot;Best in Show&quot;? It was a film by 

the director/actor Christopher (oops can't remember his last name, 
someone help, my brain cells are diminishing as we speak!) somebody-
or-other, who also directed and starred in my beloved &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; 

and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; all parodies, and what he would 
call &quot;mockumentaries&quot;... Well you can guess what &quot;Best in Show&quot; 

mocks (of course, in a lovingly way)
Dog Shows, and their Dog crazed owners... It is hillarious and I 
recommend it for a night of, very silly, but very enjoyable laughs 
on this subject. If you see no humor in it, then that is a sign 
that you are truly a hard core person who takes animals more 
seriously than most :) Let me know if you ever check it out or have 
seen it already...Bonnie, I bet you liked this one :)!

&gt;I always recite my own &quot;mantra&quot; before doing that: &quot;The number you 

see will not affect your attitude, or you are not allowed to get on! 

.....Yes my grasshopper friend Diane, I too used to try an fool 
myself into believing that mantra too, but it didn't work... I find 
the highly spirtual mantra:
&quot;AAAAAhhhhhhh! Die! You scum sucking scale, Die!&quot; highly more 

effective :)

But the important thing is the NoS stickers I have put on every 
weekday this month.
&gt; &gt; Diane
....Wow Sheats, that is a great bit of good news, and more than I 
can say for myself... I think I am going through a rebel against 
everything phase this month? The diet is going basically well, so I 
am not upset at all... Infact, in the absence of my dreadfully 
departed (I wasn't going to call it &quot;dear&quot;) scale, I measured myself 

this am, feeling pretty slim in the waistline, and it said I took 
off another 1/4 inch... These will add up folks! Before you know it 
I will be accruing many inches lost, because I really want it bad!
Love,
Deb
