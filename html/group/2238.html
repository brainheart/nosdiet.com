----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;lee33183&quot; &lt;lee33183@...&gt;
Thanksgiving wasn't too bad for me but today I have gone wild with
the leftovers. It is like this food is here, so I have to eat it so
it doesn't go to waste.

My dad used to say, &quot;Better to go to waste than to go to MY waist!&quot; =) 

Need I add, he is slim and trim? He says he works hard at it so I must 

believe him. (It always looks so easy for someone else!)

I don't feel like making a full confession of my own but I, too, had my 

legitimate and not-so-legitimate Thanksgiving pleasures. =) And I heartily 

agree with &quot;TGIM&quot; even though I didn't do too many awful things. Hey, 

&quot;TGIM&quot; might be a great new design to think about for CafePress, eh? I've 

never heard anyone say TGIMonday before so it would really provoke some 

questions!

It occurred to me that this might be a good time to encourage everyone to go 

to www.cafepress.com/everydaysystems and order one little reminder, be it 

coffee cup, mousepad or refrigerator magnet, to inspire you and help you get 

through the dangerous month ahead!! I am looking forward to the arrival of 

my supersize NoS mug and magnets, some of which I plan to share with 
friends. What a unique stocking-stuffer those would be, for friends who 

might want to join us. And if you're feeling brave and mission-minded, buy 

a button and wear it to every holiday party!

I think it will be very helpful to have a visual reminder on the 
refrigerator or in my hand, it's great publicity, AND it helps support the 

NoS website. I am feeling free to broadcast this commercial because there's 

nothing in it for me and only a little something in it for Reinhard...not 

profit, just a contribution toward expenses.

Shop till you drop!
Diane
