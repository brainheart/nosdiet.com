&gt; &gt;In FLorida we loathe wearing hose( speaking for myself of course)
&gt; 
&gt; Speak for all of us, Julie! I was just thinking the other day 
that I don't 
&gt; remember the last time I put on a pair of stockings. [As long as 
we're 
&gt; discussing terminology...it's odd, I call pantyhose stockings 
because my mom 
&gt; did but I don't think that's standard &quot;American.&quot;] Anyway, I'm in 

Florida 
&gt; too and although I used to wear them to the office years ago, I 
don't think 
&gt; I even put on a pair once last winter! Too much bother and so 
uncomfortable 
&gt; unless it's really cold (50-60 F?).
&gt; 
&gt; It's funny there are so many (vocal) Florida people on this list!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I also bought a new pair of walking shoes last night, hoping that 

will help 
&gt; &gt;with the hip problems.
&gt; 
&gt; A good chiropractor (emphasis on &quot;good&quot;!) might also help. I wish 

I could 
&gt; send you to mine but I don't think you're in West Palm Beach. He 
fixed my 
&gt; mom's hip in just a couple of visits. Everyone I send to him 
comes back 
&gt; thanking me profusely. He's a genius--and he doesn't make you 
dependent on 
&gt; him, which is very rare!
