Ah man, now I'm wanting to juice. I loved to juice and did it for &quot;health&quot;
reasons...but it is one of those things. I'll do it for 1-2 weeks and then
something will happen and nothing. I agree though, I prefer to eat my
veggies/fruits then drink them. I have to say, that breakfast sounds GREAT
and I would juice my fruit and just see if you lose weight on it. Pretty
much what everyone here said.
Also you could juice veggies. Maybe 1 grapefruit and then some carrots 
or
spinach?

Sometimes it was non-existent, sometimes it was coffee
or tea, and sometimes it was a 20 oz Pepsi with a
sausage biscuit from Whataburger!
.....Yes the good old morning belly bomb!!! LOL...
Keep up the healthy changes... Save me some juice!
What kind of grapefruit do you like? I like pink because it's not
so sour/bitter... but I read some article which said Red grapefruit
is very heart healthy... Something about Quercitin or something..
Actually all &quot;Red&quot; fruit are great for you..Strawberries,
Watermelon, Cherries... :)

&gt; Thanks for the comments. Happy Nossing!
.....You are most welcome my Samurai friend! :)

Very cool!
