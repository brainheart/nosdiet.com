Hi Reinhard and all :)
I know that No S is supposed to be flexible yet strict on some basic 
rules...I think I have encountered an everyday problem, which as the 
months get cooler, will become even more &quot;everyday&quot; (esp with flu 

season etc...)
Here's my little conundrum...I like to have soup for lunch or 
dinner, along with either a salad or sandwich...This is not 
something I can do using the &quot;One physical plate&quot; rule...Okay, maybe 

I have to give up soup, or just combine my salad and soup (boy would 
that be messy)
Help me Reinhard or anyone else...I really don't want to cheat this 
system...Is there any loophole or provision for soup? Or do I have 
to adhere to a fourth, NO S &quot;Fence&quot; law, &quot;No S...oup&quot;, in order 
to 
adhere to the 3 Commandments of No S?
If the answer is, to make the portion really smaller on one of the 
two courses, I will do this...
Soup to me is very filling and comforting, but I don't want to fool 
myself into thinking that this is ok, unless approved from a &quot;higher 

authority&quot; :)
Fondly,
Debbie
PS FYI...The &quot;Fence&quot; Laws are the extra rules in Orthodox Judaism, 

which are the first line of defense to protect against breaking any 
of the over 600 Biblical Laws...EG: One of the Biblical Laws 
is &quot;Thou Shalt Not Cook a Calf in Her Mothers Milk&quot;, in order to 

ensure that no one break this rule, a &quot;Fence&quot; rule was created later 

which states that one shouldn't eat meat with dairy, then it 
eliminates the rare possibility of boiling a child in it's own 
mothers milk, a gruesome idea to be sure...I really never even 
understood this rule of keeping dairy and meat separate until I 
looked into the whole &quot;Fence Laws&quot; explanation...I wasn't raised 

orthodox, but I do really love Chicken Soup :) Okay so there's the 
info on Fence Laws which are there so as not to break those original 
Biblical Laws from, I think mainly, the Book of Deuteronomy...I am 
not Kosher, but I do want to keep &quot;kosher&quot; with No S :)
