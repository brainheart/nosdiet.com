thanks for the supportive post. I teach 3 days a week . I had a stroke 
last
year and I haven't too much stamina now, but when the weather is fine I 
have
4 little dogs to play with.. Actually only 2 of them walk. the baby(15weeks
old) doesn't know how to walk on a leash yet, we've started learning and 
my
oldie great grandmother is too ill this will be her last illness, her heart
has failed.. When my puppy knows how we will have to do a lot of road
walking to train her to be a show dog.I hope the weather is fine this
winter. I'm not meant to get cold.

&gt; &gt; Having lost a fair bit of weight I am now stuck for a couple 
of
&gt; months. I have kept to about 1,000 to 1,500 calories as day(Idon't
&gt; count accurately) and am obeying the rules. I exercise at least once
&gt; a week.Pilates and the exercise bike and treadmill.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Hana :) This is one of those &quot;plateus&quot; My guess is that 
in
&gt; order to move those pounds that are sticking to you like unwanted
&gt; glue, you will have to do a bit more regular aerobic exercise...I
&gt; think that the walking (UR) is more beneficial for weight loss than
&gt; SG (which seems more to tone and firm up muscles) So if you aren't
&gt; walking already, and just didn't mention it for some reason, it
&gt; might really help...It's great that you like Pilates, and the other
&gt; stuff, but once a week exercise might not be enough to convince your
&gt; body to peel off the pounds.
&gt; I can't remember if you said you were actively teaching, or retired?
&gt; Whatever your schedule I'm sure you can come up with a few more days
&gt; of moving (as Brits would say) &quot;The Bum&quot; :)
&gt; Congrats on your initial loss and maintenence of it...Frustrating 
as
&gt; it seems, it is still a victory just to maintain a loss, since it 
is
&gt; so so easy to gain weight once we hit 25+ years, and Diabetes is a
&gt; formidable foe when it comes to appetite stuff being out of whack,(I
&gt; was a raving loon when I had gestational diabetes, and I'm not so
&gt; sure where I am now, since my weight skyrocketed up again last
&gt; year...) so give yourself a big hug and pat on the back and keep it
&gt; up :)
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
