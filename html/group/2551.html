Hi Reinhard, I am going to brag now to start out...I had two very 
good days and have 2 slashes down so far...It's funny when I look 
ahead at all the empty days ahead it freaks me out, so I am just 
going to get my &quot;blinders&quot; on and focus on each day, as it causes 

much less duress on my oh so fragile willpower and mind!
I did 3 days of SG, and it's funny, but like you said about &quot;Pavlovs 

Dog&quot; in the www.shovelglove.com website, when I put on my special 

song for working out, I instantly start to (metaphorically) drool 
and even if I was poopy and tired before, as last night, I get 
motivated and am instantly up and at'em...granted if I am tired I 
don't immediately start whaling on the thing, and take a bit of time 
to just wiggle around and do a bit of &quot;Fetch the Water&quot; (that's 

doing a move as if you were hand over hand lowering and lifting a 
bucket in and out of a well, with the handle of the SG as the &quot;rope&quot;)
this gets my arms and hands warmed up.... Okay so who is inspired 
now?! LOL :)
So here's my question, not diet related, but post related...
If I want to do a multiple reply post, as you did with todays posts, 
is that possible? I don't mind going to the trouble 
of &quot;snipping&quot; &quot;clipping&quot; and all that &quot;ing&quot; stuff, if I 
know that I 
can consolidate my replies, then I won't have to write 5 little 
ones... My memory is such that writing a new post, and trying to 
keep the details I wish to respond to in my head, would be all but 
impossible... Since you are the (iron lol) moderator maybe you have 
special &quot;powers&quot; which allow you to lift comments out of several 

posts and then throw them all into one...Hmmm
If there are instructions on how to do a &quot;medley&quot; post like that, 

please enlighten us....
And on another note, I wish to voice my opinion (uh oh!) on how 
important it is for people to feel they can speak up when they are 
not &quot;bragging&quot; as well... Not to say that we all should turn into 

whining babies, but if writing a &quot;I need help&quot; type of letter can 

save you from demolishing half a gallon of double fudge brownie ice 
cream, then this should be allowed and even encouraged...this is 
after all, a support group, and as nice as it would be to always 
have good news, life is not like that... But a negative can be 
turned into a positive by taking action and taking responsibility, 
and the first step is simply acknowledging that there is a problem, 
be it in post style or quietly to yourself :)
Last thing...seriously, at least till tonight :)
One of my best friends called me last night in tears on the 
phone...She recently got married, to a guy I introduced her to 
(how's that for good inspiration :) and since they have been engaged 
a few years back now, our correspondence has been so sketchy...for 
the past year now, I've been wondering what role I play in her life, 
and whether her absence has been due to business, or maybe that we 
somehow are drifting... Out of the blue, I get this call and she 
says &quot;you are one of the only people I can call when I am feeling 

this way&quot; she was bummed out because she was beginning to feel very 

out of control with food, and in her words said &quot;I can't stop...&quot; 

with a terrified sound in her voice... Well, for six months I 
questioned what was going to be the fate of our friendship, one that 
started in 5th grade, and last night that call, just reminded me 
that, even if we don't get weekly or even monthly updates on each 
other, there is a very special bond with us... I was honored and 
tried to be as encouraging as I could (even mentioned NoS but she is 
a big Weight Watchers person so I didn't want to push it).
For me, this group, is the great friend, upon whom I can call, day 
or night, and &quot;cry on&quot; the collective shoulders of others.... I 

doubt very much, that I would feel as steadfast about staying on NoS 
if it didn't involve the group! :)
To newbies, I am a postaholic in recovery! LOL So I'll try to leave 
some space for you too, heh heh, but please forgive me when I go a 
bit wacko with the length or even the things I say. I am a corny 
old fool, but my heart is sincere, and I do really care about the 
health of our collective Spirit :)
Have good days fighting the evil habit lords of S all!
Peace and Love,
Deb
