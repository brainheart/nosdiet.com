Hi Diane

Let me be the first to wish you a very happy birthday and the acquisition of new good 
habits!

I just wanted to pick up on something you mentioned about the habits of slender 
people: another one that I have heard is that, prior to eating something, they 
imagine how they will feel after having eaten it and as a result, often reject items 
that they realise will not make them feel good. The 'not feeling good' bit might 
consist of a physical feeling or an emotional feeling (guilt perhaps?) but in either 
case serves as a deterrent. I've tried this and can sometimes make it work: this 
morning I successfully resisted a croissant on the basis that I would have felt so 
angry with myself afterwards (NB I'm lowcarbing and no-essing) but at other times I'm 
halfway through the 'sin' before it even occurs to me to do this. I really liked the 
quote about habits that you posted on this list and am trying hard to establish this 
technique as a habit for myself!

(By the by, I'm also on the Low Carb UK list and saw your reference to this site 
there - thanks!)

Best wishes and keep us posted on how you are getting on.

Alison

Well, it's me again. =) My life got crazy for a few weeks so I had no time
to chat here, but I'm making up for it now! This is long, be warned. =)

One of the secrets of slender people is supposedly that they don't eat
unless they are hungry.
