You give such good advice. I love that. And you seem so together. Your significant 
other is lucky to have you. 

cheers,
tawanna

I haven't officially started, but I've been trolling about for a while building up 
inspiration.

thank you!

Hi mygoal135,

One nice things about internet groups like this is
that they give you a sense of accountability once
you've announced your intentions, but not the
inescapable shame that you might feel before people
you physically know. It's a purely voluntary
accountability, you know you can sign off and walk
away any time. You don't resent it, and yet there is
that gentle pressure that helps you succeed. Not to
mention all the built in sympathy that comes from
everyone having the same sort of problem.

Ease up on the fury. Just brush it off and get back on
the wagon. You're unconsciously budgeting for the fury
in your behavior and it's contributing to your
failures. Be encouraged. It takes a surprisingly short
amount of time to build a new habit. You're never more
than a few weeks away. And once you're there, things
get much easier.

&gt; thank you all for your support and advice after my
&gt; last post. my 
&gt; dieting history consists of a whole lot of
&gt; goal-setting and promise-
&gt; making. sometime after each of the initial
&gt; commitments, i have 
&gt; messed up. sometimes a diet has started and ended
&gt; within a single 
&gt; afternoon. i get furious with myself. i've gone on
&gt; most of my 
&gt; diets without telling anyone, because i'm afraid of
&gt; people seeing me 
&gt; fail. when i have told people that i was trying to
&gt; lose weight, and 
&gt; i've fallen off the diet, i've tried to cover it up.
&gt; as i look back, 
&gt; that system does very little for me besides make me
&gt; feel bad about 
&gt; myself. no matter what i say to myself or my
&gt; friends, the scale and 
&gt; the waistband will speak for themselves at the end
&gt; of the day. 
&gt; thank you for helping me realize that. 
&gt; 
&gt; 3 weeks in.
&gt; 148.5 lb.
&gt; 13.5 to go.
