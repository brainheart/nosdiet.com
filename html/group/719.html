Hi Gwen,

There's no magic to this system: it works because you
eat less, and you eat less largely because it's easy
to monitor how much you eat. Yes, it works slowly. But
because we have a clear sense of what is being eaten
we also have the power to tweak effectively.

From what you write, it seems like you're right about
where you want to be in terms of consumption, but not
quite. You've lost something. You're not gaining. It
might only take the tiniest adjustment to tip you over
into losing again.

I'd count the granola bars as esses. They're pretty
sugary, and I imagine they're also eaten as snacks.
Subtracting those 1 to 2 a day might be all you need.
Is that doable?

Keep bugging us if that doesn't do the trick or if you
think there might be other culprits. Do keep in mind
that little tweaks like this will probably not result
in a drastic overnight change, but they can work
wonders over time, and they are sustainable, which is
the most important and most neglected issue in
dieting.

&gt; I've been doing no-s for 6 weeks now and clearly
need some help. 
&gt; First, some vital stats: I'm 50 years old, 5'1&quot;,
about 110 pounds 
&gt; (yes, I know the insurance charts say that's
normal), I exercise 3-4 
&gt; days a week with either toning floor exercises
and/or &quot;gliding&quot; or 
&gt; jumping on the trampoline. I work in an office for
attorneys so I 
&gt; sit on my tush most of the day. At the end of the
first two weeks, 
&gt; I was thrilled to see I had lost 1/2&quot;, but nothing
more since then. 
&gt; I have no idea if I've lost any pounds because I
don't have any 
&gt; scales. While I realize my situation is not
desperate, I'm tired of 
&gt; looking like I'm 6 months pregnant. Obviously, the
weight I want to 
&gt; lose is right in the tummy. I live on a lake and I
don't want to 
&gt; feel embarrassed about the way I look when swimsuit
season rolls 
&gt; around.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the reasons I joined no-s was because I
wasn't given a strict 
&gt; list of foods to eat, or not to eat. So I continue
to eat the same 
&gt; foods as before: toast or cereal for quick
breakfast, a sandwich or 
&gt; hamburger for lunch (I have cut out the chips/fries
except for s 
&gt; days), and dinner seems to be whatever hubby and I
agree on...often 
&gt; grilled something with a salad or baked potato or
beans...we eat 
&gt; very simply at home. With spring finally having
arrived in Texas, I 
&gt; hit the ground running on the weekends. My s days
generally go with 
&gt; only two meals a day, the good news is that leaves
some calories 
&gt; available for sweets! Confession: I often have a
&quot;light&quot; beer in 
&gt; the evenings and one or two granola bars a day;
other than that I 
&gt; believe I've been pretty faithful to no-s.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas on getting more inches off?
&gt; 
&gt; Gwen
