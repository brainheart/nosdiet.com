you're probably right, brian, but i've actually been doing it for years - 
i=
t's not a matter of ambition! ever since i was in high school i haven't 
be=
en *able* to eat breakfast, and have been operating on 2 meals a day. my 
b=
ig problem is seconds... and if i go out to eat (which used to be frequent)=
, the high-fat 3-course meal. turning down the option for an appetizer 
and=
dessert is a new experience for me ;)

thanks Reinhard for the suggestions - i'll keep working on it and am trying=
a Very Wee third meal.

and big congratulations to those who are losing!

&gt;Hi Risa,
&gt;
&gt;I'm sorry to hear about your joint problem. As far as
&gt;exercise goes, I don't know how to begin to advise
&gt;you.
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me the psychology of emotional eating goes
&gt;something like this: &quot;Food is a reward. It's the
&gt;simplest, most basic kind of reward. The good kid gets
&gt;the cookie. So now I'm stressed and depressed. I feel
&gt;lousy about myself. But if I give myself a reward,
&gt;then I must have done something good, right? If I give
&gt;myself the effect, then maybe the cause will follow.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;This is irrational, of course, but you can see how
&gt;your subconscious might be wired to believe this.
&gt;What's the trick to getting around it? I don't think
&gt;mere conscious awareness will do it for most people
&gt;(though it's a start). I think you need a replacement
&gt;reward. If you can walk or exercise, that's best. If
&gt;not, a healthy or harmless food/drink reward seems
&gt;like the best alternative. I think you're on track
&gt;with the carrot and lemon water. It may take some
&gt;experimenting to come up with just the right reward
&gt;for you.
&gt;
&gt;I would strongly consider 3 vs. 2 meals. I think two
&gt;meals is overly ambitious and perhaps not even a good
&gt;in itself. Giving yourself the full 3 means no &quot;well
&gt;I've only had 2&quot; excuses for emotional eating. It
&gt;might nip it in the bud, before it becomes a problem.
&gt;
&gt;Less isn't necessarily better. Consider the following
&gt;quote from that Harvard article I linked to regarding
&gt;the Amish:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The French explanation for why Americans are so big
&gt;is simple,&quot; said Jody Adams, chef/partner of Rialto, a
&gt;restaurant in Harvard Square, speaking at the Oldways
&gt;conference. &quot;We eat lots of sugar, and we eat between
&gt;meals. In France, no one gets so fat as to sue the
&gt;restaurant!&quot; Indeed, the national response to our glut
&gt;of comestibles is apparently to eat only one meal a
&gt;day=97all day long. We eat everywhere and at all times:
&gt;at work, at play, and in transit. &quot;Japanese cars=97the
&gt;ones sold in Japan=97don't have drink holders,&quot; New York
&gt;Times health columnist Jane Brody said at the Oldways
&gt;conference. &quot;The Japanese don't eat and drink in their
&gt;cars.&quot;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Best of luck, and keep bugging us if you're having
&gt;trouble,

&gt; &gt; *embarrassed face*
&gt; &gt; actually, walking is part of the problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i've been trying to get steady exercise but i have a
&gt; &gt; serious structural problem with most of my joints -
&gt; &gt; hips being the worst. therefore, any kind of
&gt; &gt; physical activity can cause shooting pains (meaning
&gt; &gt; i don't know when or where or how it'll happen, but
&gt; &gt; when it does happen it's bad), and if the intensity
&gt; &gt; of the shooting pains is high enough it causes a
&gt; &gt; corresponding intense emotional trigger that can
&gt; &gt; last for hours, subsequently causing grinding of
&gt; &gt; teeth yadda yadda. the joint problem/pain is its
&gt; &gt; own thing i've been going to multiple drs and
&gt; &gt; allopaths for several years now to fix; it's the
&gt; &gt; emotional response i'm trying to damp down, since
&gt; &gt; that lasts so much longer than the pain does.
&gt; &gt; physical therapy exercises aren't too intensive, so
&gt; &gt; i need *something* to help.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i've been trying the carrots option offered here -
&gt; &gt; it helps a little. i'm also trying to drink a lot
&gt; &gt; more water. i sometimes put lime or lemon juice in
&gt; &gt; it. i'm also buying mass amt's of pickles, since
&gt; &gt; they have a minimal calorie load. debating going to
&gt; &gt; three meals, at 12:45 / 6 / random needed pm time
&gt; &gt; instead of my original 12:30 / 8:30 plan.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; still working on it - was sort of hoping someone had
&gt; &gt; a better idea than i'd had ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt;Emotional eating (eating because you're stressed or
&gt; &gt; &gt;depressed) is a little like emotional marksmanship
&gt; &gt; --
&gt; &gt; &gt;not a good idea. Try this instead: emotional
&gt; &gt; exercise.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing fancy, necessarily, just a little walk will
&gt; &gt; &gt;do. Doesn't have to be a safari, around the block a
&gt; &gt; &gt;few times is sufficient. Don't groan and ignore me
&gt; &gt; &gt;just yet. Consider:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;1) how the eating just makes you more depressed and
&gt; &gt; &gt;stressed (and fat).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;2) how a little walk does the opposite. And this
&gt; &gt; isn't
&gt; &gt; &gt;the only benefit: you have leisure to *think* about
&gt; &gt; &gt;whatever is stressing or depressing you. Because
&gt; &gt; &gt;walking irrationally makes you happy (both because
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt;the sense that you are moving towards a destination
&gt; &gt; &gt;and because of the endorphins or whatever) you are
&gt; &gt; &gt;more likely to find a solution or pep yourself up
&gt; &gt; than
&gt; &gt; &gt;you would be with mere stationary thinking.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Don't plead lack of time. Just get yourself out of
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;house. As for how long your walk should be, make
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt;decision once your feet are in motion. You're in no
&gt; &gt; &gt;condition to think properly, even about as little a
&gt; &gt; &gt;thing as this, cooped up inside next to the
&gt; &gt; &gt;refrigerator.
