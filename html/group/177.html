Congratulations on making it to week 2! One more week
and by my crude rule of thumb you'll be fully 
habituated.

I love it that you're able to stick to the diet
without making a big production of it -- that no one
even notices. I think that speaks well of the diet,
and of your character. Good luck, and keep us posted!

&gt; I am doing fine with it. Eating three meals a day is
&gt; a relief...I 
&gt; don't have to think about my next meal constantly,
&gt; like when eating 
&gt; those metabolically-spaced meals...six a
&gt; day...yikes. I got so sick 
&gt; of eating...and only eating a tiny bit. So I am
&gt; liking this nosdiet. 
&gt; It's the only diet I've been on, where nobody else
&gt; knows I'm on it, 
&gt; so I don't have to explain anything to anybody. The
&gt; other night, my 
&gt; Dad made a huge, yummy spaghetti dinner, complete
&gt; with garlic bread. 
&gt; I served myself a huge pile of salad, a small
&gt; portion of spaghetti, 
&gt; and a small hunk of the garlic bread. I ate slowly,
&gt; and NOBODY knew 
&gt; I was on a &quot;diet&quot;, which was a big plus for me. Last
&gt; diet I was on 
&gt; was Atkins, where I had to make a huge fuss about
&gt; eating only the 
&gt; meat and salad...the nosdiet makes eating &quot;normal&quot;
&gt; again. 
&gt; 
&gt; Avoiding the sugar is simple after having been on
&gt; Atkins. I have 
&gt; never eaten much sweets anyway...I am fat because I
&gt; have always 
&gt; OVERATE. I love food and can eat and eat and eat.
&gt; With the nosdiet, 
&gt; I control my portions (similar to the six tiny meals
&gt; like in Body 
&gt; For Life), but because at each sitting, I get to eat
&gt; a real meal 
&gt; (not a palm of protein, a fist of carb, and no fat),
&gt; I feel 
&gt; satisfied, like I'm not on a diet, actually, I'm
&gt; just not being a 
&gt; damn pig anymore!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks very much. I will keep you updated. Glad to
&gt; join the group.
