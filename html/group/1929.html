&gt; &gt; All this talk about kids and sugar jarred some memories of my 

&gt; &gt; youngest son (he is now 20) As I look back he was born a 
natural 
&gt; &gt; NOSer. Every birthday he wouldn't eat his birthday cake. I 
don't 
&gt; &gt; think he tried it until he was about 5 and then only if he was 

&gt; &gt; hungry. 
&gt; ....There was a time when Richard could take around 20 minutes to 

&gt; eat 1 cookie... He savored it...He played with it. He got half of 

it 
&gt; on his face and not in it :) In my mind, I kept thinking, we 
aren't 
&gt; born with an overeating &quot;gene&quot; we learn this behavior, and wished 

&gt; that I could be more like him, the roles reversed, as he was now 
the 
&gt; model :)
&gt; 
&gt; That is the strange thing, till this day he only eats if he is 
&gt; hungry which is usually meals and eats normal. And he doesn't 
&gt; &gt; snack for the sake of snacking. 
&gt; 
&gt; ...God Bless Him Lee, we are the strange ones, he was choosing to 

&gt; eat when hungry, which in the best of all worlds, *is* normal.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I brought the wrong baby 
&gt; &gt; home from the hospital. 
&gt; 
&gt; ...I'm sure you most certainly did not! Let him be your role 
model :)
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

I didnt tell you all earlier but my 18yo daughter is pencil thin, 
picky eater, never ever eats unless she is hungry. Funny thing is I 
taught her this when she was about 5 or 6 when i was on weigh down i 
think. Too long ago. But she still follows these rule. We will see 
what happens when she is pregnant someday(way in the future)and the 
babe is demanding she eats more.Anyway she is now finding she has 
numerous food allergies from a kenesiologist her b.f. mom took her 
to out in nevada.Isnt it wonderful our kids arent nec. taking after 
us in all aspects. :)Just the good habits hopefully. Do as I say not 
as I do !! :)Jools
