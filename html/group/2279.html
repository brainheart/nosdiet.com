----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;julie&quot; &lt;eternalrock1@...&gt;
&gt; HI Diane, I realized that also the other day, but I also realized
there are Christmas Parties,Open houses, employee dinners to go
to,food gifts showing up in the office etc..

Yes, you are absolutely right. I am back in an office again this year and I 

know there will be a steady procession of stuff...gifts from hither and yon, 

as well as things people bring in from home or other parties, or gifts given 

to them...to get rid of their own temptations!

About 10 days ago I walked into the kitchen and was confronted with a large 

box of doughnuts, and the feeling I had was very odd. It was an immediate 

dismissal: &quot;Oh, look at that. Those aren't for me.&quot; They didn't even look 

like something edible. As I said, it was an odd feeling. I realized that 

part of the reason was that my decision had already been made, as firmly as 

possible, in advance. A between-meal snack, especially a sweet, was simply 

NOT AN OPTION. I had already had breakfast and wasn't hungry, and that 

helped too.

Now, I should make it clear that I don't always feel this strong! But it 

was quite interesting that this situation wasn't even difficult!!

Another thing that helps is to remember that I already know what ALL of 

these temptations taste like. You don't get to our age without having 
tasted just about everything under the sun...and most of them aren't worth 

the trouble they will cause us later. Sometimes I look at a danish or 
doughnut or cookie and can imagine exactly what it will taste like, and I 

remember that I was a bit disappointed last time I had one, and I know I'd 

be even more disappointed this time...and that's the end of it. 
Store-bought baked goods especially are not worth eating. If I ever see a 

unique homemade goodie that I've truly never tasted before, I will probably 

have to taste it, but there's another secret...you don't have to eat the 

whole thing! You can cut off one bite, and as the saying goes, &quot;One bite 

tells it all.&quot;

I remember reading that Mrs. Fields (of cookie fame) keeps her trim figure 

by being extremely selective about the sweets she eats. If she takes a bite 

of something and it isn't absolutely incredibly scrumptious, she won't eat 

any more of it.

It's been my observation that most picky eaters aren't fat. =) I don't 

admire pickiness in general but it's something to think about.

Diane
