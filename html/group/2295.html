Dear No S,
To Deb, I am sure your Mom meant no harm, after all she did write a note
about an S day....but I always feel &quot;you sabotager&quot;
when anything out of the planned pops in my path...like my friend who always
brings me goodies, and I thank and later toss....normally,
or like my DL whom I asked yesterday to pick up a couple of big salads 
for
our lunch yesterday, as, and this is unusual, I did not get a chance to 
fix
lunch......and he picked up a pizza! I always overeat pizza and pasta...I 
am
Sicilian! But he just didn't understand ...he heard &quot;lunch.&quot;...not 
&quot;big
salad.&quot;..and I happily ate til I couldn't eat another bite, then blamed 
him
for being Saboteur! But I said it to myself, because I am the one who pigged
out, and he was only being nice, and it wasn't on his planned diet either,
he is a low carber, and was probably thinking &quot;if only she had fixed 
lunch,
I would have resisted the old &quot;pizza temptations&quot;&quot;. So less said to 
each
other the better, otherwise we shall stress and eat more!!!!!Arrrrrgh.
Someone wrote about &quot;perfection&quot; this morning, and I must say I shall 
try
progress instead....just now the Thanksgiving holiday threw me off, and 
my
thinking is &quot;if I cant be perfect, why try....well now I shall try to 
think,
if I can't be perfect, at least try to make some progress.......sounds
better!
Bonnie
