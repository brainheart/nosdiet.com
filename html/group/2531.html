well my dad is 89 he will be 90 in june and he is on no medication he reads
gardens goes for walks etc.. i am over 50 and i am not on any either :) 

so you can stay healthy i think our drs are too hasty to prescribe
medication instead of telling people sorry you need to eat right and lose
weight instead of taking a pill for your aches and pains

Greetings to all those just starting the No S diet lifestyle. This time 
of
year everyone is looking for a shot in the arm to get their life on the
right track.

I found the No S diet thru a friend about a year and a half ago. Believe 
me,
when I am not following the guidelines, my waistline suffers. This really
works. So stick with it.

My New Year's Resolution is not exactly about weight but factors in. I 
read
a feature in a local paper a few weeks ago about a 96-year-old woman who
does not take any prescription drugs. That blew me away. I thought, &quot;Is 
it
possible?&quot; Everyone I know over 50, including my dear husband, takes
medication for their heart, sugar, blood pressure....the list goes on. 
And
all those are directly related to weight control. I know there are some
factors besides lifestyle that contribute to these health conditions. But
let's be honest. Consider your family members who are overweight. What 
are
their medical conditions? Do they take prescription drugs? Now, count the
ones who are at an ideal weight. Short list in my family. What are their
medical conditions? Which group is better off?

Okay, enuf grand standing. Back to my resolution. I am 40 years old, and 
am
committing to growing old gracefully without the dependence on prescription
drugs. Who can afford them anyway? I realize anything can happen down the
line, but I plan to do my part now to keep the only body I was given healthy
and thriving.

Best wishes for a healthy and blessed 2005!
