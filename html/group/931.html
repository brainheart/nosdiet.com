Welcome, Sandra. 

I think the weekend &quot;pigfest&quot; is less a problem than
your discouragement. The habits you build on 5/7 of
your week will influence your behavior on the last 2/7
-- it just takes a little while to get into the
groove. Try to make it to a full three weeks of strict
no essing instead of just one and see what happens. My
bet is that your weekends get less piggy without much
conscious effort on your part. Get a calendar and
slash out the successful no-s days to remind you of
your accomplishments when the piggy guilt sets in.
Remember: we all have some pig in us. No S works
because it lets the pig out of the pen once in a
while, at regular controlled intervals, instead of
vainly attempting to lock it up completely. Because
the pig *will* get out eventually, and if we didn't
let it, it's going to be roaring mad and do some
serious damage.

On an unrelated note: I called &quot;mygoal135&quot; &quot;Melanie&quot;
in my attempt to defuse the &quot;religious war&quot; thread.
Sorry about that. 

Reinhard

&gt; I am about 30 lbs over weight. I found this group
&gt; on the internet about
&gt; 6 months ago and have been intrigued since. I
&gt; continue trying to go the
&gt; fast route thinking I can lose this weight by
&gt; drinking two shakes and
&gt; one meal per day and then have a huge 3 day pigfest
&gt; and then fall back
&gt; on weight watchers which lasts a few days and then I
&gt; have another 3 day
&gt; or more pigfest. I have been successful a few times
&gt; with weight watchers
&gt; and that's why I continue to try and fall back on
&gt; it. I don't stay on
&gt; any program and continue to stay at a hefty weight
&gt; for me. I workout
&gt; every day- I walk 30 minutes every morning and then
&gt; workout at night
&gt; for 1-2 hours at least 6 days a week. There is no
&gt; reason for me to be
&gt; heavy. I tried nos diet for a week - I felt good
&gt; during the week,
&gt; however overdid it on the weekend with sweets -
&gt; which is my huge
&gt; downfall. I understand the program - I need to do
&gt; something that works
&gt; for me. Could people please reply with when they
&gt; started, how much they
&gt; needed to lose, how much they have lost and how they
&gt; feel. I have never
&gt; been 30 lbs overweight, I usually played with 20
&gt; llbs, I am very
&gt; discouraged.

&gt; &gt; When you say snacks refer to When. I assume you
&gt; &gt; mean no between meal 
&gt; &gt; eating at all, is this correct.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that's what I mean. Snacking is a more
&gt; dangerous
&gt; excuse for excess than sweets or seconds because it
&gt; has this veneer of legitimacy -- it *can* be done
&gt; right, but almost never is. So I avoid it
&gt; altogether.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I bring this up,
&gt; &gt; because, I usually 
&gt; &gt; eat after exercising. How do you handle this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just make sure to do my exercise and eat my meals
&gt; at
&gt; the right times. I prefer to eat about an hour
&gt; before
&gt; exercising, so that's what I do (breakfast at 7,
&gt; shovelglove at 8). 
&gt; 
&gt; Is it difficult to arrange your exercise
&gt; routine/meal
&gt; times to your satisfaction?
