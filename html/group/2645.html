Hi Nancy -

Learning is what it's all about! If we don't start by learning about 
ourselves, nothing will ever change. And...(here's my obvious statement for 

the day)...change isn't easy.

I know what you mean about the sweets. Snacks was my #2 nemesis but I think 

he's fading away from neglect--at last. Sweets is still #1 but over a 
couple of years of more-or-less low-carbing, I'm thankful to say my 
quantities have gone way down. I don't think I could get through a hot 

fudge sundae even if I wanted to. Large quantities of sugar now make me 

feel sick. (I never thought I'd be saying that!) I think...though I'm not 

sure...that my body changed as I kept trying to avoid sugar, and becoming 

more successful with each attempt. Now it can't tolerate the sugar-abuse it 

used to take. Your body really does know best, if you give it a chance, 

&quot;listen&quot; and trust it. Now I don't like things I used to like, and I've 

gotten pickier and pickier about which sweets are even worth the bother of 

eating. Dark gourmet chocolate, yes. Hershey's milk &quot;chocolate,&quot; no. I 

could tolerate M&amp;M's in the old days, but now they just taste like waxy 

sugar and I can't get past the first one. I'm generally not a food snob, 

but I think it's okay to be snobby about desserts!

I bet sugar was (and is) as big a deal for me as it seems now for you, so 

I'm hoping that my experience will encourage you. One thing that helped me 

for a long time was to use some of the sugar-free chocolates available now. 

Many (not all) of them are really good. I feel they are useful as a crutch, 

rather like other aids to habit-breaking (nicotine patches, for example). 

You're getting the chocolate but not the sugar. They are also self-limiting 

because if you eat too many you will wish you hadn't! (Gas. Sometimes 
amazing amounts. Effectively prevents repeat offences.) I feel that the 

new sweeteners are safe enough--that there are worse things we're already 

eating and not knowing it! At one point there were some SF chocolates I 

honestly liked better than the &quot;real thing.&quot; (And they don't leave that 

yukky taste in your mouth 10 minutes later, like the ones with sugar do.) 

One or two was all I &quot;needed.&quot; Now, interestingly, I can't be bothered to 

buy them any more. I look over the selection in the store...I've tried them 

all...and now I always conclude that I just don't want them.

I do still have one jar of Nuggets (chocolate mint) on my desk at work, 

because I like to share with co-workers, and occasionally I have one, or 

two--only when feeling very stressed or very bored!--but I hope to stop 

doing that soon. I justify it on NoS by saying it's the sugar I could put 

in my coffee but don't. =P But they're not great--still not worth their 

sugar!

I am learning to appreciate fruit and I think I will start working more on 

this. I found that dependence on sweets took away my taste for fruit, but 

after staying sugar-free for a long time, the first time I have a piece of 

any kind of fruit, it's incredibly sweet and flavorful. I'm just out of the 

habit of eating fruit--and buying it. But if I get serious about 
eliminating the last few bits of sugar I'm having on weekdays, I think I 

should also be serious about eating a couple of fruits per day. Fiber, 

vitamins, lots of good things in them! I do already eat as many vegetables 

as possible, because I think they're even more important, but I'm sure God 

had a reason for creating the amazing variety of fruit that exists.

You sounded a lot like me and asked for advice, so now you know what I've 

done and what I'm doing. I know we'll lick this if we keep learning and 

trying.

Well, my first week of No-S is behind me and I have to admit I
didn't do very well at all. I was very good the first day, but it
went downhill from there. However, I feel I learned some things. For
example, I realized I really don't have a problem with two of the
s's--snacks (at least in terms of chips and crackers) and seconds.
My problem is strictly sweets. I hadn't realized how much I depend
on sweets for comfort, to relieve boredom, etc. So with that in
mind, I'm hoping to spend some time this weekend thinking about what
I can do to satisfy those needs more constructively.

If anyone has some advice to offer, I'm all ears! You folks have
been very helpful already.

Anyway, I hope you all have a good weekend.

Nancy
