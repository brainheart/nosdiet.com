yes i think it would help to watch that film a few times as a reminder 
of
how not to eat.. he did eat way to much sugar with the sodas and the milk
shakes .. but besides that lots of the information he gave about how our
kids eat in school was pretty scary too

I just saw part of the independent film Super Size Me last night. If 
you want motivation for eating in a sensible, healthy way watch this 
film. The film maker was in excellent health starting out and his 
experiment was to eat fast food three squares a day and only move as 
much as the average American for one month. By the second week he'd 
gained 17 pounds and his cholesterol was up 100 points! He was 
depressed and tired and his liver function was questionable. The 
reasons - too much sugar and other empty carbs, and saturated fat, 
with no exercise.
The film was a real eye opener!
