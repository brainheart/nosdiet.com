hello out there...you are not alone....
I have been dieting since February 15 and lost 9 pounds...
I have dieted different ways for many years off and on..
I have sugar diabetes..had it for over a year and half...if you don't do something 
about your eating habits now..you will pay for it later.. I have found a way before I 
discovered this site..that goes along with what I'm doing...
When I was first diagnosed with diabetes.. I take pills for this...I got my sugar 
under control at first..then I ate like I used to.. can't do it..my sugar skyrocketed 
up to 200-300 for several months..which is very very bad..all that sugar free stuff 
is very misleading..except for the jello and diet drinks.
Well I printed out some pages starting with 8am to 9pm and I write down what I eat on 
each time slot.. I love potato chips and bread dearly but for 6 weeks I did without 
them..Within that time frame, my sugar dropped down to the 90's -115..which is 
wonderful and has stayed there.. so I had to make a decision for my health.. I 
definitely don't eat sweets, snacks or seconds...which I was doing before I found 
this website and I agree with it.. NOW I do watch my carbs.. 
but you can't cut them out completely..you have to spread them out thru the day ..so 
last week I ate a turkey sandwich..with 2 slices of 35 calorie wheat bread and 12 
baked lays potato chips...yum..I coulda ate more but not worth my life...a once a day 
thing and not always every day... I love to munch... so I have 1/cup nuts with a diet 
soda and eat slowly... I also buy the turkey bacon and microwave it..til its 
crisp...in my mind its like a flavored potato chip...works for me and is a lot better 
for me. I have a notebook full of pages of my eating habits for the past 6 weeks so 
far...write what you eat down..look at it.. make adjustments...write down what works 
for you that day or if it didnt work.. I also made a place on that sheet for 8 
glasses of water.. I check off every space for 1 cup of water I drink...sometimes I 
drink 10 glasses...water is very very important especially if you eat a lot of 
proteins..Im walking a mile every day down..using a cane...I'm 56... diabetic,
glaucoma, hyper tension, rheumatoid arthritis, I've had back surgery and my diet 
affects all of this and these problems affect each other..so don't wait til its a 
half to case.. Good luck...its not easy but its the way to go...its a decision only 
YOU can make....Carol

Hello everyone. Well, I haven't posted here again because I figured that the noS diet 
wouldn't work for me. On my first weekend, I ate like a total pig. I wasn't able to 
keep myself from snacking, and put the 2 lbs I had lost right back on. For me, it's 
difficult to stop with one little snack. You know like with Lays potato chips - you 
can't eat just one. Well, I'm that way with LOTS of types of snacks. However, I am 
going to try REALLY HARD to get back onto this plan. Since I can eat some fruit - and 
I love fruit - then maybe I can handle it. I'll just have to follow the rules more 
closely. I also try to stay away from carbs as much as possible. Bread and pasta are 
binge triggers for me. A couple of baked potatoes a week probably will be okay. But 
honestly it doesn't take much to get me snacking indiscriminately. :( Last night I 
got up at 3:00 in the morning and had a snack cake. I have those snack cakes in the 
house for my grandson's lunch. I try to get him to eat
fruit instead of cookies or snack cakes, but he doesn't eat fruit well. I'll have to 
work on it some more with him. But he is a little underweight, so I really don't want 
to put him on any kind of a diet that will keep him from putting on weight. Why is it 
that food is such a stressor???!!! Anyway, everyone keep me in your thoughts as I am 
going to give this another try. I'm kind of desperate to find a way of eating 
healthfully that will work for me and my husband. I really need to lose at least 20 
pounds.

I am the disgusting slovenly pig who made the suggestion about starting
on a noS day. I discovered the website on a Saturday and made a decision
to start on Monday. During the weekend, I had a lot of time to pay
attention to my eating habits, which was useful in and of itself; I also
was able to think about what I wanted to eat and how I was going to
manage my meals come Monday. I am prone to hyperbole; sorry if I
offended anyone.

You didn't offend me. In fact yesterday I was beating myself up for 
being piggy. In fact I found this website by punching in the words I 
am fat on my search engine. That is how bad I felt about my weight.

I had a great week last week but during the weekend I had alot of 
food. Monday I put the 2 lbs on that I had taken off and was very 
upset. (Ladies, I am also suffering from those monthly cravings we 
get.) I did good Monday but yesterday I just broke all the rules and 
mentally beat myself up and hid from the group. I am over that now 
and can go on again. I am still having the cravings but I think my 
body has to get back to the sugar leaving my body and settling down. 
Last week that took a couple of days and then I was fine.

Thanks everyone for the help.
