As far as I can tell, from your list, the only &quot;infraction&quot; on your 
s-
days, vs. the rules of no-s days, was the Copenhagen, and the apple 
tart. If you really want to get technical, maybe the beer would be 
borderline, but really there were only 2 actual sweet sugar treats 
the entire weekend. Am I correct? Oh, and I almost missed the fortune 
cookie. My bad!

&gt; &quot;Typical&quot; is too hard to say, wishful thinking is
&gt; bound to intrude, but here's what I had this weekend,
&gt; as far as I can remember. It's not perfect, but it's
&gt; not crazily excessive either. Sunday I probably ate a
&gt; bit less than usual (somehow missed a proper lunch). I
&gt; used to eat way more than this every day, and my s
&gt; days in the beginning were also much worse, so don't
&gt; be depressed if your s days are much worse than this
&gt; right now. It takes a while. I drink a lot of water,
&gt; often with some lemon or lime squeezed in. I don't
&gt; mention that below.

&gt; &gt; Since there has been lots of discussion recently
&gt; &gt; regarding what s-
&gt; &gt; days look like, I would like to know something. I
&gt; &gt; know that 
&gt; &gt; technically, the s-days have no rules whatsoever,
&gt; &gt; but could you, 
&gt; &gt; Reinhard, give us a typical day's menu for one of
&gt; &gt; *your* s-days? Just 
&gt; &gt; for example. Tell us the exact foods you eat,
&gt; &gt; quantities, # of times 
&gt; &gt; per day, hour of the day, snacks, treats, etc. We
&gt; &gt; all know that over 
&gt; &gt; time, the habits formed on the no-s days will bleed
&gt; &gt; over into your 
&gt; &gt; behavior on the s-days, so we would (or at least I
&gt; &gt; would) like to 
&gt; &gt; know how that has shaped your own habits on the
&gt; &gt; s-days.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As always, thank you so much for creating this forum
&gt; &gt; and supporting 
&gt; &gt; us all.
