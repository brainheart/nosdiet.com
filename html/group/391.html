Hi Saleta,

I'm sorry you didn't get a nice payday at the end of
your first two weeks... A few things to keep in mind:

1) Though some people do see results right away, no-s
is not necessarily speedy. It's a marathon, not a
sprint. The emphasis is on sustainable weight loss. I
didn't look at a scale until I was a couple of months
into it. I'd encourage you to use the scale sparingly
(if at all) in the beginning. People who lose a lot up
front get their expectations get too high. People
don't lose enough use it as an excuse to quit. And the
fact of the matter is that the scale isn't going to
tell you anything very meaningful until several weeks
have gone by. Yes, people do lose a lot of weight
quickly on more drastic diets (as I'm sure you've
experienced), but they almost never stick with them
(as I take it you've also experienced).

2) It is still possible eat too much while abiding by
the literal rules. If you're in this boat, you're
still in better shape than you were before. With only
three windows of opportunity for food to get it, it's
much easier to identify the culprits. 

I'd be cautious about pursuing #2 with too much
vigilance at this point. You really may just need a
little more time. I think at this point the most
profitable way to invest your energies is still just
firming up those core habits, unless you suspect
you're sneaking in something really beyond the pale. 

Is the weight gain you describe significant? Or could
it just be random flux? I know it's a lot to ask that
you invest a few more weeks without anything tangible
to show thus far, but I do think it's the best course.
Honestly, I don't know if I was any better off than
you 2 weeks into it. I do know that 2 months into it I
was very pleased, and still am now at 2+ years.

Don't be sorry for &quot;rambling,&quot; that's the whole point
of this group. I just hope we can get you back on
track, and with better results to show for it over the
next few weeks.

Good luck, and please &quot;ramble&quot; on if this doesn't cut
it...

Reinhard

&gt; A small confession to the group. I caved in today
&gt; and had a second. 
&gt; Okay a heaping second. I guess we are bound to fail
&gt; once in a while. 
&gt; It doesn't mean I am any less accountable. 
&gt; I was doing so well and I weighed in yesturday and
&gt; I din't lose 
&gt; anything, infact I gained. Am I doing something
&gt; wrong? I am sticking 
&gt; to all the stipulations and I am even a bit hungry
&gt; at the end of the 
&gt; day and still not eating any snacks before bed
&gt; (which is a real 
&gt; hurdle for me)! Any suggestions? I guess I ate more
&gt; at dinner due to 
&gt; being so dissapointed in myself and fell into that
&gt; defeatist 
&gt; attitude crap as I'm famous for! I do have an eating
&gt; disorder 
&gt; backround but I am one of those who never got
&gt; dangerosly underweight 
&gt; and was currently back in recovery and let my weight
&gt; creep back up. 
&gt; I am 30 lbs from where I am most comfortable. I'm
&gt; terrified that I 
&gt; am stuck here at this weight and will never get back
&gt; down without 
&gt; the use of past drastic measures. I am struggling
&gt; right now. 
&gt; Sorry for rambling, it just helps to &quot;talk it out&quot;
&gt; ya know. Thank 
&gt; you for listining.
