Hi Bonnie,

I wouldn't worry about it. Doesn't sound like a
problem.

&gt; How does a couple of cups of coffee before breakfast
&gt; fit in, that is without
&gt; sugar, but I must use at least a half cup of milk
&gt; total?

&gt; Dear No S Followers, 
&gt; This person said it all. 
&gt; I, also , was making myself and my poor husband
&gt; crazy, different diet every
&gt; time I turned around. I also don't have too much to
&gt; lose, 25 to 30 pounds,
&gt; in my case, and kept saying&quot;just like when I quit
&gt; smoking, got to keep
&gt; trying until I find a way to succeed. &quot; Now I have
&gt; found the way to quit 
&gt; Dieting&quot; and still lose weight. Bonnie

&gt; 
&gt; I'm glad to hear that this is working for you. I am
&gt; just starting my third
&gt; day, but I gotta tell you that this plan is going to
&gt; be a winner for me.I am
&gt; not extremely overweight. about 15 lbs., but my way
&gt; of eating over the last
&gt; 4 years or more has been trying. I would read all
&gt; these diet plans like..
&gt; don't eat carbs,don't eat fat, never eat a speck of
&gt; sugar. I would latch on
&gt; to them for a few weeks, but realize I couldn't or
&gt; wouldn't stay on them for
&gt; life. I then began to really eat out of control in
&gt; between plans. I have
&gt; done more damage to mself by all these plans . I
&gt; didn't know what to eat
&gt; anymore. I can see how people get trapped into real
&gt; eating disorders. I
&gt; think I was close. I like the idea that I'm eating
&gt; food like everyone else.
&gt; I have freedom to not have to think about it
&gt; constantly. I also imagine I
&gt; will save alot of money buying normal food, not
&gt; energy bars and no fat this
&gt; or that. Thank you for sharing about your new found
&gt; freedom and encouraging
&gt; this newbie ! Louann
