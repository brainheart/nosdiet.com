I had a golden retriever when I was a girl. For the last 30 years I have 
had
Italians. Not the easiest breed to deal with, very wilful and hell to
housetrain.This baby girl of mine is the 4th generation of my line.It's 
her
great grandmother who is dying of heart failure, but is still feisty.At
least they don't take up a lot of room.I have a ring of beanbags around 
the
stove in the living room and little bodies covered in their blankies
toasting.I know of one couple who decided they had to stay together and
couldn't divorce because of their Maltese. They started to separate a number
of years ago and as far as I know they are still together and reasonably
content. the little dog is happy.Yes I know a bit about French healthcare,
It's the envy of Europe. I have a friend in astern France, who takes he
children to specialist doctors at the drop of a hat. I'm glad your friend 
is
doing well, so am I have identified which muscles are not responding well. 
I
cannot raise my left arm properly or rotate itOtherwise I do everything.I
work 3 days a week as a science teacher.and go to Pilates classes every 
week
as well as getting to the gym when I can.It doesn't cost too much as I 
work
for the local authority and they own the gym. Private Gyms are expensive 
to
join.Most of the people I meet there, when I go in a morning are about 
my
own age 57 and I'm hoping that going more often will get the weight moving
again there are 14 pounds to a stone about 6 1/2 kilos. I have got rid of 
10
kilos and got stuck. and I don't have ice-cream. I'm one of the few people 
I
know who doesn't really like it

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dear Hana,
&gt; I also just got a new puppy, only he is a year old Golden. Now I have 
3
&gt; Retreivers! He is very loving. Normally I have always gotten new pups, 
but
&gt; he was a casualty of divorce. So now my oldest is a cancer survivor of 
11,
&gt; and then my now &quot;middle pup&quot;is 3. They have Italian names...except 
for
Roxy,
&gt; we have Guido and Nino. I had no idea you had a stroke last year. So 
did
one
&gt; of my dearest friends, just before he turned 60. He is doing great 
now,
but
&gt; a little frustrated as he was working and very active before, he lives
&gt; outside of Paris, so the healthcare is excellant in France. But he 
knows
at
&gt; this point he can almost do everything he did before, just slower. By 
the
&gt; way, no S is kicking in for me finally. It was not the diet that was
flawed,
&gt; but I am the one who served ice cream in my shop all summer. We stopped
&gt; serving the sugar free as no one was buying it, so then I started 
eating
the
&gt; regular....bad move!
&gt; Lately, slow but sure, as I am 61, I have been dropping a pound of Fat 
a
&gt; week. My jeans are feeling looser...8 lbs so far...is that a stone? 
Less
&gt; than 4 kilos.
&gt; Bonnie
