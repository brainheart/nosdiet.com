Dear HM

Maybe this sounds silly, but one piece of advice I would have is not to 

focus so much on your weight. Focus on how good it can feel to eat less than 

you do now. As soon as you start eating less you feel lighter and better in 

your body, at least that's what I find. Think of that feeling as permanent. 

Sometimes I miss stuffing my mouth full of crap, but not very much. Really 

I'm just trying to numb myself out and avoid whatever is really going on. 

Better to face up to it.

Anyway, welcome to the gang!
Brian

Hi everyone. I'm 17, not even 5 feet tall and weight about 165 pounds last 

I checked. I've been
going crazy trying to lose weight and I have a feeling the NoS diet will be 

the trick. But I need
support!

I'd like to get down to a weight of about 120 or 125. I know its a whole 

lot to drop but I don't
think its impossible. Any suggestions? I'm starting the diet tomorrow.

Thanks

HM

=====
It has come to my attention, through numerous philosophical debates, that 

God, with countless names and shapes, is actually the same being for us all 

- GOD IS THE PERSONFICATION AND EMBODIMENT OF KARMA. This holds true for 

any religion or faith in history in which a God or muliple Gods exist.
...I wonder which name we should make sure not to use in vain...
