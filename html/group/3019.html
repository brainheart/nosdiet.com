&gt; HI and welcome Deeyala,

You sound like a fun lovin colelge girl, its always funny to us when 
people finally stop lurking and join. 
We have something in common in that Deb is one of the reasons i 
joined also, bright, funny, witty, beautiful (i know your reading 
this Deb :)
I would encourage you to tackle the habits first, as that is the 
hardest. No sweets, snacks or second helpings. Its really very 
simple, but i also know it can be hard for college students, so as i 
have told others in your position- clean out the tempting things 
you like to snack onfrom your side of the room(if thats your case)
gets your roomies support if possible. Dont keep food accessible, or 
sodas(with sugar)
Depending on where you eat your meals, just remember no seconds, no 
sugar.
Enjoy your weekends or special days, and please dont feel like you 
have to do SG gung ho. one thing at a time. 
It took me several months before i started exercising. and i dont 
regret it in that tackling those bad habits was really impt as that 
is what put the weight on to begin with. I wasnt even sure it would 
work for me,and i didnt lose right away, but i felt so much better 
and more in control of my life and without all the sugar i had been 
eating my blood sugar is so much better now. I dont get jittery like 
i used to. My daughter has lost nearly 20# on this EP and she is 
14yo. I figure if she can anyone can. Its that simple really. 
regular food in moderation is the key. I now have lost 10# since Jan 
1st- with EP, treadmill 3-4 times a week, ive also started taking 
vitamins daily again, somthing Ive not done in years. I decided i 
was worth it ! 
Well anyways i am rattling on, i wish you great success with this 
and hope you continue to post.

Julie/Jools


&gt; hi evryone
&gt; i ve been reading all your post for 3 weeks or so and i finally 
decided i am going to join in the conversation... and the nos 
diet ,too
&gt; mmm... i ve already made my shovel glove a couple of weeks ago and 

i used it TWICE..! he he he, the first time was a disaster because i 
used my back to do all the movements and winded up having a very 
funny feeling down my back. for a whole week , or so . second time 
was better (but it was 10 days ago)..! i couldnt believe how unfit i 
ve become (&amp; maybe always been , but didnt quite notice it before).. 

i still find &quot;time&quot; a major issue to deal with, i never have any ... 

not even those SG 14 mins..! and the &quot;timing&quot; too is my next major 

issue, tried to do it in the morning but i never wake up early 
enough (those 14 mins are really very crucial for me to get to my 
classes on time - or sometimes only &quot;5 mins late&quot; ) he he he.. when 

i m back from college i am usually very tired to do anything 
remotely resembling exercise so i sleep for a couple of hours and 
when i am finally awake i d rather study then jump around my room ( 
somehow i have this funny belief that even as little as 2 mins
&gt; jogging will leave me far too tired to even read anything, 
eventhough i feel quite energetic for a couple of hours whenever i 
manage to exercise)..
&gt; so i need u &quot;experienced essers&quot; to tell me how u managed 

the &quot;time&quot; and the &quot;timing&quot; issues when u first started..
&gt; and today feb 8th is my first day as a nosdieter...! (i am not 
attending any of my classes today so i might as well shovel glove..!)
&gt; and Debbie, u rock..! u re one of the reasons that made me join 
in..
&gt; and Reinhard, i think i am deeply in love with u ..! so when u 
start looking for a life-long partner take me into consideration..
&gt; he he he
&gt; XXX
&gt; Dee
