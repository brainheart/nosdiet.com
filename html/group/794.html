You don't necessarily have to have breakfast food at breakfast if you 
don't care for it. Leftovers from lunch or dinner are great also.

Even a sandwich.

Welcome

&gt; Hello, 
&gt; Have you thought of adding &quot;splenda&quot; to you tea or coffee. 

&gt; You can drink sugarless, between meals. Sometimes I enjoy 
&gt; &quot;diet rite &quot;pop or diet coke, if I cant find the other, 

pepppermint tea or
&gt; decaf coffee....I only allow me caffine before breakfast and just 

a couple
&gt; of cups as I get the shakes and hypoglycemic with too much 
caffine. I also
&gt; get a little shaky with nutrasweet, and try to avoid it as much 
as possible,
&gt; using Splenda if needed.

&gt; 
&gt; My plan is to start full swing tomorrow morning. I have already 
been 
&gt; watching my portions and my grazing in the last few weeks but 
have 
&gt; not been so as strict as I should. I know I eat more than I 
should, 
&gt; mostly through grazing. My meals tend to be small so I will have 
to 
&gt; try bigger meals to start off with to curb that need to graze. 
&gt; Sweets are not really an issue for me. I will be cutting my 
coffee 
&gt; and tea intake to try to reduce my sugar intake though as i drink 

at 
&gt; least a full pot of both a day (an IV and liquid caffination 
would 
&gt; be much simpler no?) 
&gt; Any words of advice to make it through the first day? Food 
&gt; suggestions? 
&gt; 
&gt;
