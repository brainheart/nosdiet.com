Hello;

The picture links are below.

I disagree. I looked at the Amazon book pictures of Weil, Phil, and 
Atkins. I don't think you can tell from the pictures that they are 
fat or not. They certainly don't have a runner's look, but as far as 
I know they don't push all that much exercise. I was looking around 
my classroom and faculty room today, looking at everybody's face, 
separating it mentally from the body. There were round faces on 
skinny-enough bodies and vice versa.

The suits told me nothing.

It is a fair question, though. I wonder about Spears (Zone) and the 
Eanes (Protein Power) and Shwarzbein (sp?) (Shwartzbein?). 

I haven't read Weil or Phil, but the others I think contributed a lot 
by knocking down the anti-fat high carb idea. As I've said before, 
they are often looked upon and reported in a hysterical, sensational 
way, polarized and misrepresented. Now, after they have apparently 
won the argument in the media for now, they are still misunderstood. 
The media has a hard time getting anything straight with their sound 
bites and their need to sell news.

I flat out don't believe Atkins was 70 lbs overweight as reported. 
Even his suits could not have hidden that. Having the biggest name 
out there, he and his diet ideas have been the biggest target of all. 
He died as a result of a fall (I feel safe in believing that, but who 
knows). Whether he would have eventually died of whatever other 
condition, or whether that condition was a result of his diet, is all 
just speculation.

The good news IMO is that the nosdiet can match or even beat any 
other diet out there. It is fun to compare the cost of reading the 
nos website, or even just the preamble to this group, against the 
cost and time to buy and read all the volumes of diet books and 
programs, good or bad.LOL.

&gt; 
&gt; If the prospect of millions of dollars in sales can't
&gt; inspire you to lose weight, what can? But I guess they
&gt; figured (rightly, sadly) that suckers will pay even
&gt; so.
