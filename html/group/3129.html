There's so much going on in the world of school meals here in Britain. 
Our
school(I'm a science teacher) is dropping Chips (French Fries ) and Burgers
after Easter. It's taken celebrity Chef Jamie Oliver to bring the problem
to the notice of some important people. Some schools that have gone over 
to
Healthy Eating, have reported a big improvement in behaviour and reduction
in health issues like asthma attacks
Salads are available. I eat one every day and so do other women staff, 
but
I actually saw two kids having salad today (older girls admittedly)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well, Group, I only sent the article because of the BMI test which I 
found
&gt; to be a bit much, and why don't they give the kids less sugar and 
white
&gt; flour and soda pop, more fruit, not juice, veges, not potato as the
only...
&gt; instead of giving them all the junk and saying &quot;why cant you kids 
get
slim!&quot;
&gt; Plus a lot of schools have dropped Phys Ed, the only time in the day 
that
a
&gt; lot of kids would ever get exercise. Yes, Deb, I love Dr. Weil, and 
yes
Dr.
&gt; Douglas is a bit extreme, but I never believe all from anyone, but he 
is
&gt; making a great point, and
&gt; what I got from that is &quot;No S would be better taught to kids instead 
of
grading them on BMI, that they have not been taught anything about eating
right and exercising more! &quot;And isn't Texas another one of the fattest
states among us, not to offend any of you wonderful Texans but I read it
somewhere because of all the Chicken Fried steak and all....maybe it was 
Dr.
Douglas....hmmmmmmm Bonnie
