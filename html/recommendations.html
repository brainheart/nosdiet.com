<h2>Et tu, Reinhard?</h2>

<p>Oh lay off, I could have splashed a banner ad or obnoxious popup on
the home page. I'm just trying (vainly, I fear) to make a dent in my
monthly adwords and internet bill so my wife doesn't divorce me when
she sees it.</p>

<p>The nice thing about internet affilicate programs as opposed to the
tradition marketing paradigm is that I (the publisher) choose my
sponsors, they don't choose me. I can therefore, if I have a shred of
integrity, choose to advertise products that I actually like and think
are good, which is what I've done here. You will notice by the
cheapness of the prices that I did not simply go to amazon and sort by
most expensive item to get my list.
