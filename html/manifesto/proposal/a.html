<h1><i>A Book Proposal for</i> The No S Diet</h1>


<h1>The No <img width="72" height="73" src="/images/nos.png" align="center" alt="S" /> Diet</h1>

<p>Just three rules and one exception:</p>

<ul>
<li><em class="no">No S</em>nacks</li>
<li><em class="no">No S</em>weets</li>
<li><em class="no">No S</em>econds</li>
</ul>

<p>Except (sometimes) on days that start with 'S'</p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>Too simple for you? Simple is why it works.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Is there really room for anything new under the sun as far as diet
books are concerned? Hasn't every possible gimmick already been tried
-- several times -- without making the slightest dent in the
relentless advance of obesity?</p>

<p>There's one thing left: <b>simplicity</b>.</p>

<p>The No S Diet is a diet plan so short and simple that it fits on
the cover of a book -- or a book proposal. It also fits on
refrigerator magnets, mugs, pens, plates, bumper stickers -- see the
"promotion" section, below. No pseudo science, no miracle foods, no
counting calories or carbs or fat, no disgusting recipes or draconian
meal plans, just plain old common sense, charmingly and mnemonically
codified. In brevity: a mantra, a haiku, a spell. But down to earth as
a kansas wheat field. It's the one approach people still have ears to
hear after all the snake oil they've been sold. And it works.</p>

<p>Let me guess. You're thinking either "that's absurd! I mean it's
cute and all, but it could never really work" or "maybe it
<i>works</i>, but how do you turn a 14 word mantra into a book that we
can <i>sell</i>?"  I'll address each point separately.
</p>

<h3>Does it work?</h3>

<p>Yes. It has. You can read what it did for me in "about the author,"
below, but more interesting is what the hundreds of people who've
posted to the <a href="http://nosdiet.com">www.nosdiet.com</a>
bulletin board have done. I don't want to derail your concentration
with a deluge of testimonials, but here is a small sample. See the web
site for more -- there are more every day. </p>

<p>Brian from Ireland writes:</p>

<pre>
I started this sometime last summer or fall, can't remember exactly. I
lost 40-50 lbs and seem to be holding steady around 185lbs for several
months now, which is good for my height and i'm happy with it. I'm
still doing no-s, it seems once I got to my ideal weight I stopped
losing it.

Sensible balanced eating. No way-out menu's. I love it! I've never
felt so content about my weight or my appetite.

Still have urges and break-outs from time to time, but they're not the
gluttonous food orgies they used to be.
</pre>

<p>Deb from Long Island writes:</p>

<pre>
I eat what I enjoy, and I balance that with regular exercise...  I
would rather take longer to get slim, than feel like I'm in a
biochemical war with my food.... I love it all....  It's almost my
first year anniversary with NOS and I have lost about 17 lbs... Keep
in mind I've been a bit lax about the rules in terms of my own issues
(eg: night time snacking...) Not by choice, but just because I've had
those habits since early childhood... They are really tough! So to get
to my goal, it might take another two years...

I don't care! I will never ever switch from this life plan... It is
foolproof...
</pre>


<p>Rich from Toronto, who has since lost over 30 pounds, writes:</p>

<pre>
A month in, I don't think I'm on a diet anymore. I'm just eating
normally, but it's a different normally than a month ago. There's
nothing left to stick to; eating because I'm bored is unsatisfying
now, going for seconds leaves me feeling uncomfortably full, and
sweets that aren't *treats* are nowhere near as satisfying as they
used to be.
</pre>

<p>No "Jared"s just yet, but pretty remarkable given that this is the
result of a hobby web site run out of my basement in my spare
time.</p>

<p>How could something this simple possibly work? Precisely
<em>because</em> it's simple -- or rather, following the Einsteinian
dictum, "as simple as possible, but not simpler." For all its folksy
charm, there's a lot of serious, practical wisdom packed into those 14
words.</p>

<p>Commercial diets are too complicated for people with outside
interests to follow ("eating = math"). Conventional wisdom rules
about diet are too simplistic and vague to be useful ("only eat when
you're hungry"). The No S Diet finds the happy medium between the
two. It's <b>simple <em>and</em> specific</b>. You have just enough
direction to do your job, but not so much that you resent its
imposition. You have a solid framework, but the details are up to
you. You have sufficient guidance and sufficient freedom. It's a
system without too much system.</p>

<p>The No S diet <b>solves the right problem</b>. Pretty much any diet
will lose you weight if you stick with it. The really difficult
problem isn't how to lose the weight, but how to stick with the
diet. According to the FDA, 95% of dieters fail to do this for more
than a few months at a time. And is it any wonder? Popular diets are
heavily optimized for rapid progress. They may be effective in an
abstract, biochemical sense, but they don't take human psychology and
motivation into account and are therefore extremely difficult and
unpleasant to be on for any length of time. What do you do
<em>after</em> you lose 9 pounds of bellyfat in 11 days? If
maintenance gets any attention at all it's as an afterthought. But
maintenance is more important than progress. Progress is intrinsically
temporary; maintenance is what you'll be doing the rest of your
life.</p>

<p>The No S Diet give maintenance its proper focus. It does this by
treating wieght control as a mental problem, not a physical one. It
focuses on incentives and enforcability, on leveraging limited
reserves of willpower to build sustainable habits. The simple, natural
behaviors it prescribes soon become automatic and permanent.</p>

<p>Even <em>successful</em> dieters from other systems will find the
no s diet appealing. "What next?" isn't a hypothetical question for
them, and chances are "more of the same" is not an appealing
answer. The no s diet is a good place to start, but it's a great place
to finish. It's the ultimate maintenance diet, the diet to end all
diets.</li>

<p>The No S Diet is <b>enjoyable</b>. It isn't just an unpleasant
grind towards a distant goal. Maybe you wouldn't do it solely for
pleasure, but you can do it also for pleasure. And when the goal is
distant and doubtful, or boring because already (temporarily)
attained, that makes all the difference. Popular taboo/miracle food
diets like low carb or low fat fail miserably in this regard. At the
outset, it might seem worth it to trade pasta for unlimited steaks (or
vice versa), but it gets old fast. Diets like weight watchers that
require you to be a full time calorie (or carb, or fat) accountant are
time consuming and joyless. With the nosdiet, no pleasure is denied,
just delayed and contained. Served up on the platter of limited
opportunity, pleasures become even more pleasurable than they were
before.</p>

<p>I could go on and on... which brings me to my next point:</p>

<h3>Is there enough material for a book?</h3>

<p>I'm not joking -- we can and should put the whole diet on the cover
of the book. Brevity is the gimmick, so why be coy?</p>

<p>Be that as it may, we have to put <em>something</em> between the
covers. What, then?</p>

<p>Questions and answers (and some provocative exclamations).</p>

<p>I don't suggest this out of laziness, merely because it's what I
have already at nosdiet.com (printout attached for your
convenience). I say this because:

<ul>

 <li>no one really wants to sequentially plow through long winded
chapters on diet. People do that now because diet authors have been
too uninspired to come up with alternatives and so there's no
choice.</li>

 <li>the Q&A format grabs the reader no matter where he opens up the
book. After the provacative jab of the cover, it's a great sales hook.
And it invites repeated browsing. It ensures that this will not be a
book to be started and shelved, but one that's actually worth owning
(and showing to all your friends).</li>

 <li>the Q&A format engages the reader as a participant. Maybe not
really, but it feels that way. To use that awful phrase, it's
"empowering." We anticipate just about every question and objection
the reader could have and respond straight on. It's like a self help
choose your own adventure.</li>

<li>
 The Q&A format reenforces the impression of matter of fact
 brevity. The diet is short. The book is short. Each section is
 short. The No S Diet has repeatedly be rechristened the "no sh*t"
 diet by visitors to the site. Let's run with that.
</li>

<li>
Finally, have you noticed that this proposal, so far, is in Q&A
format? Is it working?
</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>The Q&A format doesn't mean chaos. The questions will be organized
by topic (see sample table of contents below).</p>

<p>What kinds of questions could anyone possible have about 14
unambiguous words? You'd be amazed. See See www.nosdiet.com or the
attached printout. I could easily mine the bulletin board for scores
more.</p>

<h3>But why would anyone BUY this book when they can get this all for
free on the web site?</h3>

<p>That's right, anyone can now get (essentially) the complete
contents of this book at the www.nosdiet com website, and this will
continue to be the case after the book is published. We aren't coy
about the rules, we shouldn't be be coy about the Q&A. In fact, we'll
trumpet it's free availability. It's the right thing to do, and it
will sell more books.</p>

<p>People are sick of being conned. Really sick. They've been conned
not once but many times, in a big way. And each new con artist acts
like the last one invented the problem. We wash our hands of the whole
business. There's no con because there's no required money -- either
for the system itself or (far more significantly) for a whole big
lineup of necessary and expensive follow up products. We give away the
razor and there are no blades. In the context of the current public
mood about diet, this is irresistable.</p>

<p>We will never beg, or pretend that people need to buy this book or
anything else to succeed with no s. Over and over, we will emphasise
how easy and simple and <b>free</b> this is. The inside jacket will
read, "Yes, it's really that simple. You could put this book down,
walk away, and lose weight by following the simple rules on the
cover."  It's true, it challenges the reader to keep reading, and it
will sell more books. Readers won't buy out of mere gratitude, they'll
buy out of relief: finally, they're no longer suckers, they've been
shown some respect -- that's worth a few bucks.</p>

<p>People will feel good about buying this book. They'll get excited
about it. They'll talk to their friends about it. And they'll talk
about it as being free, which it is. What sells better than the word
"free?"</p>

<p>I'm not being machiavellian here. I don't have to be. It's genuinely
win-win.</p>

<h2>Competition</h2>

<p>There are basically two kinds of commercial diets: taboo foods
diets (low fat, low carb) and substance accounting diets (weight
watchers, points, etc). The situation is complicated a little by
hybrids (counting taboo food units) and fluff. Horrified scientists
occassionally publish sober descriptions of what the ideal human lab
rat should eat, but these fail so miserably as prescriptions that
they're not even worth considering.</p>

<p>Common sense is slowly creeping into the picture, but only in a
very masked way and unaccompanied by simplicity. The Leptin diet, as
desconstructed on the no s diet bulletin board, seems to boil down to
almost the same thing as the No S Diet, but it's heavily obscured by
pseudoscience and fluff. It also lacks the necessary safety valve and
motivation of S days. It's encouraging to see confirmation some of the
basic no-s principles, and that they sell despite a totally
incompetant presentation.</p>

<p>The 3 hour diet is the diet of the moment as I write this, and it
has a lot of advantages over the above mentioned taboo substance or
accounting diets. Indeed, it resembles the no s diet in some ways. The
blurb on the cover of the book, for example, "it's all about timing"
could also be applied to the No S Diet (and was, in fact, on the
nosdiet.com home page, until I saw they'd taken it). But in other more
important ways it is profoundly dissimilar. One can poke holes at the
3 hour diet from a bunch of directions, but the key issue that cuts to
its core is this: there's <em>too much</em> timing. It's like living
on orange alert all day long for the rest of your life ("oh crap, is
it time to eat?  Better set the alarm clock!"). Its reliance on
overclocking your metabolism by precisely timed mini meals is the
antithesis of the no s diet. The no s diet works <em>with</em> your
natural clock, not against it. Much better to do what thousands of
generations of skinny people have done than the precise opposite. As
with other diets, 3 hour might work biochemically, but it's doomed
psychologically.</p>

<p>I had been worried that the no s diet wouldn't translate, but then
I came accross the following:</p>

<pre>(hebrew article screenshot pending)</pre>

(translates the rules into hebrew and then states "this sounds better
in English")

<p>and this:</p>

<pre>(japanese)</pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre>(norwegian)</pre>

<p>People are so desperate for common sense it seems that they'll do
without the pun. These aren't anomolies. Look at the member list on
the bulletin board; they come from Austria, England, Germany, Israel,
Romainia, Canada, France, Australia, Denmark, "Planet Texas" and
more.</p>

<p>We don't have to go overseas to find evidence of a broad appeal. To
use the inevitable pop-demographic du jour, the emphasis on personal
responsiblity appeals to "red staters," the ironic tone to "blue
staters." Putting them together like I've done isn't some virtuoso
trick, some awkward chimera of marketing. It's precisely what gives
the system its draw and power: wit and wisdom, back together again, at
long last. It's deeply natural and obvious. If there's anything
surprising about it, it's why it hasn't been done before.</p>

<h2>The Author</h2>

<p>I is neither a doctor, a nurse, a dietician, a nutritionist, a
personal trainer, nor any other kind of health professional. I AM NOT
AN EXPERT. This is a tremendous advantage.</p>

<p>Diet is not a problem that requires specialized expertise. It is a
general problem with an obvious solution. If I were encumbered by any
form of expertise, this obviousnessness wouldn't be nearly as
striking. A doctor cannot convincingly say "DUH."</p>

<p>I am a librarian by training and a computer programmer by
accident. I noticed I was getting a little too heavy (borderline
obese, actually, if you want to get technical) and came up with this
common sense willpower trick. I lost 20 pounds in two months and kept
them off without spending too much time suffering or even thinking
about it. People I've explained it to have responded enthusiastically
and so I thought I'd stick it on the web. The response has been
overwhelming.</p>

<p>I've since lost an additional 20 pounds (so total progress has been
210 to 170), but to be fair, that may have something to do with the
fact that I started doing some exercise (also a routine of my own
devising -- we'll talk about this in a separate proposal, believe me,
you'll want to). This seems to be my natural, healthy weight. People
now describe me as "lean," which is sweet music to a lifelong
"husky."</p>

<p>I've been on the diet since March 2002, with no yo-yoing. Unlike
most diets, that get more and more insufferable as the gimmick ages,
no-s gets progressively easier and becomes largely unconscious. At
this point I'm about as tempted to break the rules as a devout Hindu
is to eat a cow, or a Muslim a pig. It's a great feeling.</p>

<p>Obligatory before and after photos enclosed.</p>

<p>Of irrelevent qualitifcations I have plenty. I got a bachelors in
English literature from the University of Wisconsin, a masters in
library science from Queens College New York, and am currently lead
software engineer on the Argo Genomic Visualization project at the
Broad Institute at MIT. This qualifies me to yawn at genetic excuses
for being overweight.</p>

<h2>Promotion</H2>

<p>This is one book that can (and asks to be!) be judged by it's cover
-- by it's spine, even (if we can get it thick enough to have a
spine). Just get it in stores and it will shout out from the
shelves.</p>

<p>Imagine how well a book with this cover would sell on the checkout
line of the supermarket, right next to all those impulse buy candy
bars. Probably too well! I imagine the supermarkets woundn't even give
us checkout line shelfspace because of the negative impact it would
have on sales of neighboring products. A product that sells too well,
now that's a problem worth having!</p>

<p>We won't need a slick marketing campaign. Slick is the opposite of
what we're going for.  variety of
promotional products. I currently sell no s diet T shirts,
refrigerator magnets, mugs and pins on cafepress.com. What makes these
no s diet promotional products particularly irresistable is that the
entire system fits on them. You can see the designs for these on the
enclosed web site printout.</p>

<h2>In Lieu of a Sample Chapter</h2>

<p>I'm a software engineer, I'm not going to give you a mere demo when
I have a working product. So instead of the customary sample chapter,
here is a printout of the www.nosdiet.com website. It has the virtue
of having been looked at by thousands of pairs of eyes, and it gives a
better cross section than a single chapter would. It'll sell you on
the system better than anything else I could show you.</p>
