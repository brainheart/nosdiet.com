<p>The No S Diet, also known as the "Grandma Diet," the "Why Didn't I Think of that Diet," and the "No $ Diet" is a program of <a href="http://everydaysystems.com/">systematic moderation</a> I invented for myself that seems to work for similarly minded people.</p>

<p>No funny science or calorie accounting involved, just a few simple
and mnemonic tricks for building sustainable "good enough" eating habits.</p>

<p>There are just three rules and one exception:</p>

<ul>
<li><em class="no">No S</em>nacks</li>
<li><em class="no">No S</em>weets</li>
<li><em class="no">No S</em>econds</li>
</ul>



<p>Except <span style="color: gray;">(sometimes)</span> on days that start with "S"</p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>Do that and you'll probably lose most if not all of your excess
weight. For subtle pyschological reasons I go into below, you'll
probably start eating <em>better</em> as well as less. And you'll
<em>enjoy</em> eating a whole lot more.</p>

<p>How could something this simple possibly work? Precisely
<em>because</em> it's simple -- or rather, following the Einsteinian
dictum, "as simple as possible, but not simpler." For all its folksy
charm, there's a lot of serious, practical wisdom packed into those 14
words. Read on if you need more convincing...</p>

<h2><a id="others"></a>Why are other diets so lousy?</h2>
<p>Most diets today can be divided into two categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pseudoscientific forbidden foods diets that pretend that you
can go on being a glutton as long as you confine your gluttony to a
particular class of foods while completely excluding others (no
agreement on what these particular kinds of foods are, of course). <br /> <br /></li>

 <li>Diets that require
you to be a full time calorie accountant.</li>
</ol>

<p>The forbidden foods diets are patent nonsense. They contradict one
another, go in and out of fashion every ten years, and never seem to
gather any serious scientific support. You won't stick with one of
these because not being able to eat whole categories of food is a real
drag. At the outset, it might seem worth it to trade pasta for
unlimited steaks (or vice versa), but it gets old fast. And it might
even <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/diet.fitness/03/20/protein.diet.heart/">make you sick.</a></p>

<p>It's funny that these diets masquerade as scientific, because
psychologically they rely on the most primitive magicism: magic potion
foods that are good for you and can be gorged on with impunity, and
cursed poison foods that corrupt with a mouthful (carbohydrates and
fat are the two biggies, alternating roles).</p>

<p>They pretend that you don't have to do the hard work of
fundamentally altering your habits. "It's not your fault," they say,
"it's the food's fault! Just eat this other magic food instead..."
It's so temptingly flattering and easy. Alas, it isn't true and
doesn't work, and in the final analysis <a href="#excuse">it isn't
even flattering</a>.</p>

<p>The calorie accounting diets are time consuming and joyless. You
won't be able to stick with one of these because it will make you
miserable. Besides the sheer tedium of compliance, if you come to
think of food as fuel, a mere quantity, you'll come to loathe it --
and your number crunching-munching self. </p>

<p>The situation is complicated a little by hybrids (i.e., counting
taboo food units -- the worst of both worlds) and fluff. Horrified
scientists occasionally publish sober descriptions of what the ideal
human lab rat should eat, but these fail so miserably as prescriptions
that they're not even worth considering.</p>

<p>The truth is, pretty much any diet will lose you weight if you
stick with it. The problem isn't how to lose the weight. The problem
is how to stick with the diet. <a
href="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/wgtloss.html">According to the
FDA</a>, 95% of dieters fail to do this for more than a few months at
a time. You need a diet that acknowledges this grim statistic and
targets the real culprit: not your belly, but your mind.</p>

<h2><a id="superior"></a>Why is this diet so much better?</h2>

<p>Because it is simple, sustainable, and you aren't really depriving
yourself of anything. You don't have to sacrifice anything -- not
time, not health, not <a href="#nodollarsign">money</a>, not any
delicious thing. No pleasure is denied, just unobtrusively delayed and
contained. Served up on the platter of limited opportunity, each
pleasure becomes even more enjoyable than it was before.</p>

<p>There are no magic potions and there are no poisons. You are
targeting just the culprit, just the bad habit of overeating
itself.</p>

<p>Ask yourself if you can imagine staying on a particular diet for
the rest of your life. If not, don't bother starting, it's a waste of
time and will.</p>

<h2><a id="featherwieght"></a>That's much too rational and
straightforward. Come on, REALLY, why is this diet so much
better?</h2>

<p>You wouldn't take diet advice from a fat person, why take it from a
fat book? Weighing in at just 14 words, the No S Diet is the ultra
featherweight of diet plans.</p>

<p>(Yes, I know, I've now written a book myself -- but it's a wee
little thing. You can easily read it in a day. And of course, for the
bare essentials of the system, all you need is the cover.)</p>

<h2><a id="evidence"></a>Is there any scientific evidence that this diet
 works?</h2>

<p>Absolutely none. But I'm not aware that I have any competition in
this regard.</p>

<p>It is more or less how billions of thin people around the world
have eaten for millenia, if that counts for anything.</p>

<h2><a id="testimonials"></a>Is there a cheesy testimonials page like all other diets have?</h2>

<p>(relatively) <b class="no">New!</b> Yes! Right <a
href="testimonials.html">here</a>. See the <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/">bulletin board</a> for a more
balanced (if less concise) view.</p>

<h2><a id="pronounce"></a>How do you <em>pronounce</em> "No S
Diet?"</h2>

<p>It's a pun, you can pronounce it the <em>Noes</em> Diet, the <em>No
Es</em> Diet, or even the <em>No Esses</em> Diet, depending on which
aspect of the pun you feel like emphasizing.</p>

<p>I used to spell it all one word, "nosdiet," for easy googling, but
no one else did, which kind of defeated the purpose, so I
stopped. You'll just have to google with quotes.</p>

<h2><a id="sdays"></a>What days start with "s"?</h2>

<p>Saturday, Sunday and "Special" days. Special days include (your)
national and (your) religious and (your) close family's and friend's
birthdays. My apologies to atheists and non-native English speakers. A
lean and hungry look becomes you.</p>

<p>Sick days also start with S. Though I don't imagine you'll be too
hungry if you're really sick, you officially have license to do
whatever it takes to get better.</p>

<p>"Days that start with S" are discussed frequently on this site, and
since that's a bit of a mouthful, you'll usually see them referred to
them as <i>S-days</i>. Days that do NOT start with (even more of a mouthful)
are referred to as <i>N-days</i> (i.e., NON-S days). You can also think N as
standing for "normal."</p>

<p>Non-weekend-S-days are sometimes referred to as <i>NWS-days</i>. Though I
coined this awful term myself, I think it's clearer to just call them
"special" days.</p>

<h2><a id="sometimes"></a>What do you mean by "sometimes"?</h2>

<p>I stuck the word "sometimes" in the exception to remind you not to
be an idiot on S-days. It's been my experience that the good habits
you build on the non-S-days will see you through the S-days without
too much excess. My S-days tend to be no worse than my pre-No S Diet
ordinary days.</p>

<p>(relatively) <b class="no">New!</b> "Don't be an idiot"
insufficiently specific for you? <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=759">Read this
discussion</a> for a little more guidance.</p>

<p>Note: readers of the No S Diet book may have noticed that the word
"sometimes" didn't make it to the print version. The reason for this
was mostly typographical (the 14 word version with "sometimes" just
didn't fit as well on the cover).  And while some people can using the
extra reminder, "sometimes" isn't really logically necessary -- OF
COURSE you shouldn't eat snacks, sweets and seconds ALL THE TIME on
S-days. I've kept the "sometimes" on the web site so pre-book
No S dieters don't feel like I've changed the system out from under
them, and as far as I'm concerned, both the 13 and 14 word
formulations of the system are equally valid and "canonical" (<a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=2784">more on this
issue here</a>).</p>

<h2><a id="seconds"></a>What do you mean by "seconds?"</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in a <a href="/group/27.html">post</a>
 to the No S diet group, by "no seconds," I officially mean one
 physical plate, and I think for beginners especially it's good to
 stick with this, even if it means a fairly overloaded plate. If the
 amount of food on your one plate is a little bestial and disgusting,
 that's part of the educational process.
</p>

<h2><a id="sweets"></a>What do you mean by "sweets"?</h2>

<p>I mean something whose principal source of calories is sugar. Go
ahead and put sugar in your coffee or oatmeal; you have my
blessing. Of course fruits are fine. </p>

<p>But beware of soda and corn syrup "juice" drinks. I'm not just
being a killjoy; adolescent Americans get <a
href="http://www.cspinet.org/liquidcandy/">an estimated 13% of their
total calories</a> from such nutritionally bankrupt "liquid
carbohydrates."</p>

<p>I wouldn't worry too much about borderline foods like yoghurt and
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. If these are a problem for you,
i.e., you eat them every day and lay it on thick, then make them
esses. If not, don't. Just by targeting the really egregious offenders
you'll be cutting out a lot of calories. And you'll be that much more
likely to stick with the plan. If you're like most first worlders,
it's a little revolting to think how much unambiguously crappy food
you consume. So forget the borderline cases, the clear cut cases are
80% of the problem and 0% of the headache.</p>

<p>Do you know how many pounds
of sugar the average American ingests each year?
 <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/AmberWaves/April03/Indicators/behinddata.htm">According
to the USDA's Economic Research Service</a>, 105 pounds (2001). That's
about 20% of total calories. You could make a snowman out of
that. That's less than 2 years till you've eaten your body weight in
sugar. If you're a real whopper, chances are you eat even more sugar
than that, so I figure it works out about the same. And this is a
pretty conservative number. The ERS assumes that over 40 pounds of
"delivered" sugar is "lost" (147 delivered, 105 ingested), which I
find a little hard to believe, but I guess we're wastrels as well as
gluttons.</p>

<p>How do you think that compares with the sugar intake of our
ancestors? We don't have to go back to hunter gatherer times to find a
striking contrast, or even before Columbus (when it was close to nil
because there was no refined sugar in most places). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/DOCKETS/03n0338/03n-0338-c000014-01-vol7.pdf">1821 will do: 10
pounds</a> (that's delivered, not ingested!).</p>

<p>You don't need to be an Atkins nut to see there's a problem
here. Indeed, why bother taking it to the next level, by severely
restricting carbs in general, with all the dubious health issues that
entails, when there is plenty problem here, at the sugar level? If
orange juice is really your problem, you don't have much of a
problem.</p>

<p>I'm not some food hating, pleasure begrudging voice in the
wilderness. I'm not telling you to give up sweets completely. I love
sweets. But I love them even more on S days. That way I can love them
unreservedly, without also hating them for what they do to my body. On
S-days, I make sure to pick out something really nice, to make it
count. Sweets weren't designed for daily, routine consumption,
physically or spiritually. Deserve your desserts. They taste much
better that way.</p>

<h2><a id="fake_sugar"></a>Does fake sugar count as an "S"?</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in a <a href="/group/40.html">post</a> to
 the No S Diet group, I would avoid fake sugar products for 3
 reasons.</p>
 
<ol>
 <li>they tend to be pretty disgusting</li>
 
 <li>you *know* that in 10 years scientists are going to
 discover that they're even worse for you than real
 sugar.</li>
 
 <li>you might be fooling your taste buds, but you're
 also fooling the habit forming portion of your brain.
 It's bad psychology, and the whole premise of the
 No S Diet is that psychology is the most important part.</li>

</ol>

<p>So does it officially count as an S? No. But I'd be surprised if
 you can eat a lot of it without reverting to genuine S. Naturally
 slim people do not cram themselves with diet products. Neither should
 you.</p>

<h2><a id="fat"></a>Aren't you worried about fat?</h2>

<p>I don't want to seem like I'm coming down as "pro-fat" in the carbs
vs. fat debate. I think the evidence strongly suggests that too much
fat is bad for you. But I also think that much (if not most) of the
fat people consume is in the form of snack foods (chips, crisps,
popcorn, etc.)  and sweets (candy bars, ice cream, pop tarts, Capt'n
Crunch, cake, etc.), which <em>are</em> restricted by the No S Diet
(these also tend to be the worst kinds of fat). So while the No S diet
does not address fat explicitly, it does so as a kind of side
effect.</p>
 
<p>Fat is a more
complex issue than sugar. There are good fats and bad fats, and it's
often less clear which foods are high in fat (whereas sugar tends to
jump right out at you). Simplicity and clarity are important. If you
have a complicated diet that is 100% in sync with the latest
nutritional research and covers every theoretical base, it won't do
you any good if you can't stick with it (never mind that the latest
nutritional research is a rapidly moving target). Zero percent of a
hundred is zero. An eighty percent solution that you can actually
stick with is infinitely preferable to that.</p>

<p>I also don't think that anyone in the medical profession would
suggest regularly going five straight days without any fat. Unlike
added sugar, it has some nutritional benefit; the body does need
it.</p>

<h2><a id="snacks"></a>What do you mean by "snacks?"</h2>

<p>Snacks are "when," not "what." For No S Diet purposes, anything you
eat between meals is a snack. The kind of food has nothing to do with
it. So pretzels with lunch is lunch. Maybe not a particularly healthy
lunch, but the No S Diet delegates that particular micro-decision to
you.</p>

<h2><a id="healthy_snacks"></a>What about healthy snacks?</h2>

<p>Eat healthy meals. If you know you have just three, you'll make
them count. I'm perfectly aware that an orange between meals is not
going kill you, that, taken in itself, it's perfectly healthy. But the
idea is to have the orange instead of, not in addition to, and in
justification of, some unhealthy part of your meal. The problem is
primarily one of self-discipline, and if you start making all kinds of
exceptions, you'll fail.</p>

<h2>But every other diet guru tells me I SHOULD snack!</h2>

<p>"No snacks" is the rule that people seem to have the most trouble
accepting. But I think it's also the most important rule. </p>

<p>People act as if snacking is this natural thing that would be cruel
to deprive themselves of. But the truth is, historically speaking,
snacking is a very recent eating behavior. No one did it to any degree
worth mentioning until very recently - when we promptly started
getting fat. According to an analysis of USDA food consumption data by
David Cutler at Harvard University, 90 percent of the increase in
calorie consumption in men in the United States since 1977 has come
from between-meal eating. For women, it's 112 percent -- calories from
meals have actually gone down. (Journal of Economic Perspectives <a
href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:2640583">"Why have
Americans Become More Obese?"</a> Page 101)</p>

<p>So with this one rule, just two words, you've got a 90-plus
percent solution to the problem of over-consumption.</p>

<p>You'll find the same correlation when you look at the issue across
societies: obesity rates move in lockstep with calories derived from
snacking. The skinny French snack
on average <a
href="http://www.webmd.com/content/pages/10/1671_51408"> less than once a day compared to our three</a>. The even
skinnier Chinese <a
href="http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v11/n8/abs/oby2003132a.html">
barely snack at all</a>.</p>

<p>The reason snackers eat so much more food is simple: it's
impossible for them to keep track of how much they're eating without
resorting to unsustainable behaviors like counting calories. They can't
eyeball excess anymore, as they could with discrete meals. Excess sneaks
right past them in lots of tiny increments, none of which seems like
much in itself, but adding up, at the end of the day, to a tremendous
amount.</p>

<p>Why is it that despite these pretty shocking statistics you almost
never hear anything but pro-snack messages? Simple. "Follow the money."
You can't sell "no snacks." Snacks, on the other hand, especially the
booming "healthy" snack segment, are a multibillion-dollar
industry. And the surest sign of having made it as a
diet guru these days is having your name on an "energy bar" of some
sort, so they're all in on it, too.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://everydaysystems.com/podcast/episode.php?id=28">Lengthier anti-snack jeremiad here</a>)</p>

<h2><a id="lists"></a>Please tell me EXACTLY every single food I
can and can't eat!</h2>

<p>No. Sorry. Don't have the time for that. And it's really not
necessary. A "sweet" as I've defined it above means "lots of sugar." If
you have to wonder, it's probably OK.</p>

<p>Just about every diet guru publishes a list of permitted and
forbidden foods. And they're bestsellers. People buy millions of
copies of these lists. I am utterly baffled by this phenomenon.</p>

<p>I'm baffled because it's so utterly hopeless an enterprise; there
are, for all practical purposes, an infinite number of foods. I'm
baffled because the things that wind up being forbidden are often so
absurd: beets, for example. I guarantee you, no one ever got fat from
eating beets. If you see a fat person eating beets, that's not why
he's fat. Carrots, formerly the quintessential health food that people
used to carry around in zip lock bags as a healthy snack, are now
vegetable non grata. But most of all, I'm baffled that anyone really
imagines they will play scavenger hunt at the supermarket for more
than a month or two. It shows an utter ignorance of human
psychology.</p>

<p>And yet, as I mentioned, people buy millions of copies of these
lists. They must get something out of it. Maybe they get an "insider
information" thrill out of reading these oddball restrictions and
think "whew, glad I know about beets. That would have killed me for
sure." What they don't get is any thinner. These books may be good for
a thrill, but they are psychological suicide as far as losing weight
is concerned. Who is really going to run around a supermarket with a
book in hand? For a week, maybe. For a month, maybe. But that's it. At
that point they'll feel justly overwhelmed. But maybe that's <a href="#excuse">all they ever wanted</a>.</p>

<p>It's not the carrots, it's the carrot cake (etc.). More to the
point, it's <i>you</i> eating so damn much of the carrot cake. People
refuse to look at the obvious suspects because the implications are so
unflattering to themselves -- that they simply eat too much and that
there is no "stab in the back" substance to blame. The forbidden food
diets pander to this suicidal vanity. They are not just harmless (if
unmaintainable) games. They are dangerous distractions. They keep you
from seeing and confronting the real problem. This isn't "murder she
wrote." It's not the mousy schoolmarm whom no one suspected who winds
up having "dunnit." This is a brazen attack in broad daylight. Take a
look in the mirror. The guilty party is staring right at you.</p>

<p>Still want to count carbs/calories/fat/whatever after all this?
Save your money and look at the <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/cgi-bin/nut_search.pl">USDA's
nutrient data library</a>. Endlessly fascinating, if you have nothing
better to do. Those bestselling guru lists are just less
accurate/comprehensive versions of this.</p>

<h2><a id="nutrition"></a>What about nutrition?</h2>

<p>The No S Diet is a framework for controlling excess. Beyond that it
makes no stipulations about your nutritional or gastronomic
choices. That doesn't mean they're not important, they're just
separate issues. Fight one enemy at a time, not three at once.</p>

<p>That said, I find that having a limited number of limited quantity
meals makes me take them more seriously, both from a gastronomic and a
nutritional point of view. Pretty much every meal I eat is delicious
or healthy or both.</p>

<p>If you feel the need to take a systematic approach towards
nutrition too, be my guest. The No S Diet is compatible with pretty
much every other diet plan I've come across. You can be a No-S/Vegan
if you want. You could even do No-S plus Atkins, or No-S/Zone if you
want to hedge your weight loss bets (though I think it's becoming
increasingly clear these last two examples are emphatically *not*
going to help you in the nutrition department, if at all).</p>

<h2><a id="exercise"></a> What about exercise?</h2>

<p>Of course you should exercise. Diet can't substitute for
exercise. You need to do both. If you're having trouble figuring out
what exercise to do, consider <a href="http://www.urbanranger.com">walking</a>. If you feel walking is
too, well, pedestrian, get over it. Health-wise, it's the best long
term exercise you can do, and the only consistently useful or
interesting one. If you need more color, you'll get plenty using my <a href="http://www.shovelglove.com/">homemade exercise device</a> as a
supplement.</p>

<p>The No S Diet is about eating in <em>moderation</em>. If you can
lose significant weight without exercise, you're not eating moderately
-- you're eating immoderately <em>little</em>. That's not sustainable
or good.</p>

<p>Don't look at your problem as being too heavy. Look at your problem
as two behavioral problems 1) eating too much 2) moving too
little. Both of these need to be solved. Solving just one "too much"
isn't a real solution. </p>

<p>I know people hate to be told they ought to exercise, but I really
think coming at it from these two directions makes it much easier,
because you don't have to do <em>that</em> much from either. You don't
need 3 hour workouts. Try <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/podcast/episode.php?id=31">14
minutes</a>. </p>

<h2><a id="kate"></a>Will this diet help me look like Kate Moss?</h2>

<p>No. It will help you attain and maintain a healthy and therefore
presumably attractive weight. I'm not sure it's healthy to look like
Kate Moss.</p>

<p>It won't help you look like Victoria Beckham, known as Posh Spice,
Courtney Cox, or Calista Flockhart, either (I just threw that in there
for the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=anorexic+role+models&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">search
engines</a>. Sneaky, yes, but who knows many young lives l'm saving). </p>

<p>WARNING: one poster to the bulletin board <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=1921">warns that a
diet like No S might be open to abuse by people with eating
disorders</a>. Please tread carefully and consult your doctor if you
think you might fall into that category.</p>

<h2><a id="idiot"></a>What if I am an idiot and insist on following the
letter of the law but breaking it in spirit by (say) eating a gallon
of ice cream every S-day and counting my second cousin's hamster's
birthday as an S-day?</h2>

<p>Then I can't help you. You will be fat and die young.</p>

<p>Seriously, this is less of an issue than you think. I haven't heard
of anyone messing this diet up because they followed the rules during
the week and overbinged on the weekends. But I have heard from plenty
of people who anticipate this being a problem, burden themselves with
weekend restrictions to prevent it, and then crack during the week
because it's too much. S-days are a necessary reward and safety
valve. As a group member succinctly <a
href="/group/1725.html">put
it</a>: </p>

<p class="quote">S days should be S days so N days aren't.</p>

<p>("N-days" are short for "non-S-days")</p>

<h2><a id="screwup"></a>What if I screw up?</h2>

<p>Say "I screwed up" and try not to do it again. Don't try to
compensate for your screw up by extra deprivations -- self-revenge
will only make you resentful and that much more likely to quit
altogether. This diet isn't about perfection, it's about staying
healthy. It's about what you do most of the time, not about achieving
some kind of world's record. </p>

<p>The other advantage of this attitude is that it deprives you of a
very seductive excuse -- I can cheat <i>because</i> I can make up for
it later. The knowledge that there is no make up test, that you have
only one chance to do each day right, will make you that much more
serious about passing the first and only time around. It's a principle
worth applying to other aspects of life.</p>

<p>Be strict before you screw up, not after, and you'll soon find you
have very few "after"s to worry about.</p>

<h2><a id="genes"></a>But I'm genetically fat!</h2>

<p>It's possible, but <i>you</i> probably aren't. If you're like most
overweight people, it's no mystery why you're fat. You're fat because
you eat too damn much. I don't care whether it's carbs or hydrogenated
oils or granola bars, you just eat <i>a lot</i> of it. Maybe you don't
metabolize your food quite as efficiently as your skinny neighbor,
I'll grant you that (maybe), but the fact remains, you eat too much. I
don't mean to be insulting, I used to eat too much too. I put it this
way because you're never going to lose any weight if you pretend that
there are more complex and flattering reasons for your condition. So
get this genes stuff out of your head, it's probably an excuse.</p>

 <p>Consider this: <a
href="http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/defining.htm">according
to the CDC</a>, the obesity rate in the United States has doubled
since 1980. Rapid mutation? Sorry folks, evolution doesn't work that
fast.</p>

<p>If you're still convinced that you've been doomed by your genes,
view this diet as an experiment. If you can stick with it for 6 months
and not lose a significant amount of weight, then you can plead
genetics with a clear conscience. And I suspect you'll be at least a
<i>somewhat</i> skinnier genetically fat person.</p>

<h2><a id="trends"></a>So why <em>have</em> people gotten so fat over
the last 30 years?</h2>

<p>The faddists say, rather predictably, though with disturbingly
little fellow feeling, that the current obesity epidemic is the result
of the <em>last</em> fad; i.e., that we're fat <em>because</em> of the
low fat craze and now need a high fat craze to undo this (any guesses
what the <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060792299/ref=ase_everydaysyste-20/102-4610536-4165714?v=glance&amp;s=books">next
fad</a> is going to claim?). Here's my question: do you really think
the decisive factor was people wolfing down fat free (and don't forget
sugar free) cookies with a feeling of impunity? Sure people did this,
to an extent. But they certainly also had plenty of super sized
fatburgers to wash it all down. At least, it doesn't seem that
McDonalds (NYSE: <a
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=MCD&amp;t=my">MCD</a>) and
Krispy Kreme (NYSE: <a
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=KKD&amp;t=5y">KKD</a>) were
particularly poor investments during this period.</p>

<p>But I don't want to say with the paranoids "it's all the evil
corporations' fault!" In fact, I view both of these stances (fad
vs. fad, corporate evil) as manifestations of the real problem: a
catastrophic loss of belief in the idea of personal
responsibility. People today are not merely irresponsible: they are
anti-responsible. They view the idea that they are responsible for
their condition as offensive. It seems ridiculous to them, beneath
contempt. And it is precisely this attitude that has been doing them
in on the diet front and so many others.</p>

<h2><a id="graze"></a>But I'm a grazer!</h2>

<p>This is a more sophisticated excuse. Under laboratory conditions,
people who eat a controlled amount of calories over the course of many
small meals <i>may</i> metabolize them more efficiently than people
who eat the same amount of calories in the traditional three. This is
the principle behind the <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060792299/everydaysyste-20/002-6564705-9371215?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;link%5Fcode=xm2">3
hour diet</a>. Where's the rub? In real world conditions, people who
eat more frequently than the traditional three square meals wind up
just plain eating more food -- substantially more. And despite their
metabolism's scrambling, they chunk up. The No S Diet isn't a lab
diet, biology divorced from psychology. It's a real world diet, built
to withstand the pressures of your stubborn, sneaky mind.</p>

<p>Scientists who study snacking behavior "in the wild" concur. From a
2005 <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15809664&amp;query_hl=1">article</a>
in the International Journal of Obesity:</p>

<p class="quote">
Obese subjects were more frequent snackers than reference subjects and
women were more frequent snackers than men. Snacks were positively
related to energy intake, irrespective of physical activity. Sweet,
fatty food groups were associated with snacking and contributed
considerably to energy intake. Snacking needs to be considered in
obesity treatment, prevention and general dietary recommendations.
</p>

<p>"Energy intake" makes it sound so positive -- they mean
calories.</p>

<p>From a 2002 <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12084369&amp;dopt=Abstract">article</a>
in Medicina Clinica:</p>

<p class="quote">
Snacking was positively associated with a higher probability of
gaining weight among men (OR = 1.88; CI 95%, 1.40-2.53) and among
women (OR = 1.38; CI 95%, 1.10-1.73). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a
direct association between snacking and weight gain in middle-aged
people. 
 </p>

<p>Indeed, discreet "snacking" is probably the wrong word for the
continuous, automatic eating most of us do nowadays. From a 2004
<a href="http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050465.html">article</a> in Harvard Magazine:</p>

<p class="quote">
"The French explanation for why Americans are so big is simple," said
Jody Adams, chef/partner of Rialto, a restaurant in Harvard Square,
speaking at the Oldways conference. "We eat lots of sugar, and we eat
between meals. In France, no one gets so fat as to sue the
restaurant!" Indeed, the national response to our glut of comestibles
is apparently to eat only one meal day all day long. We eat everywhere
and at all times: at work, at play, and in transit.
 </p>

<p>Even if you aren't one of these unconscious permasnackers, but
count every calorie and want to "graze" to better trick your
metabolism, snacking isn't a good idea. The problem with such grazing
is that it's impossible to get a sense of how much you are eating
without paying an exorbitant amount of attention -- counting calories,
points, etc.  Doing all this math is way too much conscious overhead
to sustain for the long term, and it's not something you can automate
into unconscious habit.</p>



<h2><a id="exception"></a>But I'm an exception!</h2>

<p>So is everybody else. And even if you truly happen to be the one,
it isn't <i>useful</i> to think this way.</p>

<p>Let me put it another way: chances are you're deceiving
yourself. And on the odd chance that you aren't deceiving yourself,
maybe you should be, the other direction.</p>

<p>People have done all kinds of remarkable things because they
thought they could. People routinely fail to do quite ordinary things
because they assume they can't.</p>

<h2><a id="excuse"></a>But I want an excuse, not a solution!</h2>

<p>It sounds crazy, but a lot of people think like this. They'd prefer
to stay fat and blame McDonalds or refined carbohydrates or
hydrogenated vegetable oil or their lousy genes or anyone and anything
but themselves. I'm not saying these things aren't factors, but they
are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is just that: human
decision.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of responsibility. Responsibility can be
liberating. If it's your fault, then chances are you can fix it. If
it's not your fault, then you probably can't. Would you really prefer
that a problem be insoluble than have to work to fix it? And yes,
thinking makes it so.</p>

<p>Health aside, I'm amazed at how many people prefer to trade their
sense of free will and human dignity for carte blanche to fail. It's
like Esau selling his divine birthright for a mess of pottage,
choosing to be a slave because it is easier than being free. If you're
one of those, keep searching, this diet isn't for you.</p>

<h2><a id="howmuchless"></a>How much less will I wind up eating?</h2>

<p>I have no idea. It depends. But one nosdieter has worked it out
pretty clearly for himself (<a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?p=5779&amp;highlight=#5779">see original
post in context</a>): </p>

<p class="quote">
Here's an illustration of what you were eating before.

I'm an insulin dependent diabetic using an insulin pump. For every
gram of carbohydrate I eat, I infuse a set amount of insulin. I know
the amount I infused before No-S and the amount I infuse now.

Before No-S, I infused on average 45 units a day. Now I use about 32
units a day. that's what... &lt;calculating here&gt; about a 30% drop?

A 30% drop in carbohydrate means a more than 30% drop in total
calories since the crap I ate between meals contained more fat than
what I eat at meals, in general.

A 30-40% caloric reduction just by cutting out between meal eating and
seconds.

It's no wonder it works.
</p>


<h2><a id="ideal"></a>What is the best way to determine my "ideal" weight?</h2>

<p>I don't think there is much point in having an ideal weight. Have
ideal behavior -- habits of moderate eating and exertion. Whatever you
weigh then is ideal. </p>


<h2><a id="side_effects"></a>Are there any side effects?</h2>

<p>Yes. By setting your willpower up to succeed, and succeeding a
little bit every day, you will build up general purpose
willpower. It's like doing 50 spiritual pushups every
morning. Contrast this with the effects of the repeated failures of
willpower associated with mainstream yoyo dieting.</p>

<p>You will also start to enjoy food again, instead of merely
obsessing over it. </p>

<h2><a id="sunday_thursday"></a>Can I take my Sunday Thursday?
(etc.).</h2>

<p>Not officially.</p>

<h2><a id="some_s"></a>Can I do a "some-S" diet?</h2>

<p>You can do whatever you want, I'm not going to excommunicate you,
but this isn't a good idea. No-S isn't that hard. Try doing it
strictly for 3 weeks, that's about how long it takes to form a
habit. You'll be surprised.</p>

<p>That being said, the esses don't depend on each other. Each makes
sense on its own, and each should be helpful on its own. Do what's
possible and necessary for you. Dieting in a "half-essed" manner, as a
group member put it <a href="/group/2963.html">here</a> and <a
href="/group/3031.html">here</a>, can have wholly satisfying results
-- as long as you're clear about which half (or third) and are no less
diligent in sticking to it.</p>

<p>I've often thought that gradually progressing one S at a time might
be a good way to become a full no-esser, say start with no sweets for
a week, then add no seconds the next week, then no snacks on week 3
(or go even slower and give each the full magic habit-building three
weeks). That way you could build willpower and habit even more
incrementally. Unfortunately I'm not aware that anyone has
successfully done this [ update: it seems like <a href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=6287">someone has</a> (and rather successfully!) ] . I think the trouble is that even full no-s is
slow in terms of yielding measurable results, and lack of patience is
an even bigger problem for most people than lack of short term
willpower.</p>

<h2><a id="fence"></a>Fence around the Diet</h2>

<p> There's a Jewish expression, "Fence around the Law," which means
don't do anything that might possibly be interpreted as giving even
the appearance of violating sacred law. It's a principle that has its
use even with profaner stuff. When your habit is young, be as strict
as you can be, comically strict even. Only when you're strong, when
the habit is largely unconscious, can you afford stretchers like the
above.</p>

<p>It might seem counterintuitive, but strictness makes things
easier. There is no decision to be made, no wrangling, no "can I?
can't I?". You're pre-disapproved, so forget it and move on to
something else.</p>

<p>I hope no one will consider it blasphemous that I apply this
religious principle to profaner matters such as weight loss, because I
think it's based on a profound and useful psychological insight, and
it's with great respect that I repurpose it here.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://everydaysystems.com/podcast/episode.php?id=13">more on the advantages of strictness here</a>)</p>

<h2><a id="doctor"></a>I love the No S Diet, but my doctor says I need to
eat 4/5/6 meals a day because of my medical condition!</h2>

<p>The No S Diet has a little known loophole just for you. If you look
closely at the site, you'll notice that nowhere does it specify the
actual *number* of meals. Now most people will make a <a href="http://www.threestooges.com/">certain assumption</a>, and most
people had better stick with that assumption. But if you have a
medical condition that requires you to eat more often, you can still
do so and be a proud No S dieter. Just make sure to figure out what
number of meals is right for you, stick with it (no changing the magic
number every day), and invest in some really small plates. And talk to
your doctor, of course. As for the rest of you, pretend you never read
this. It's for people with doctor's notes only.</p>

<h2><a id="recipes"></a>Are there any No S Diet recipes?</h2>

<p>No. Have you ever <em>eaten</em> a meal cooked from a recipe in a
diet book? My experience has been that they're pretty disgusting. Diet
books tend not to be written by people who actually like to
eat. Besides, the No S Diet iet isn't about <em>what</em> you
eat. It's about <em>when</em> you eat. You can eat anything you want
-- at the right time. So use your <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679422730/everydaysyste-20">normal
cookbook</a>. It's No S Diet approved.</p>

<p>Recipes do make great filler, however, which I'm sure is why diet
books are so full of them.</p>

<h2><a id="lowcarb"></a>Gratuitous potshots at low carb diets</h2>

<p>Low carb diets, whether Atkins or some spin off, are all the rage
today. So they deserve some extra, ahem, attention.</p>

<p>As a friend of mine put it "I refuse to believe that bread, the
biblical staff of life, the food that sustained our ancestors for so
many generations, is bad for you."</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>For those of you who are not so up on the bible, consider this: the
obesity rates of France, Italy, and Japan are much lower than obesity
rates in the United States. Though I don't have precise statistics,
I'd bet money that the majority of calories consumed in these
countries come from bread, pasta, and rice (respectively) -- the
staples for which their cuisines are famous. And we're not talking
brown rice, or whole grain bread, or amaranth pasta. We're talking the
very refined stuff Atkins and his fellow gurus insist is so evil.</p>

<p>The simple fact is that most people in the world for most of
history have gotten most of their calories from carbohydrates, and
most of them were skinny (too skinny!). Percentage wise, we eat far
fewer carbs than they did. They were too poor to eat much protein or
fat. Only rich people had meat regularly. Fat was a luxury; you hunted
for eyes of it in your soup.</p>

<p>What our skinny ancestors didn't eat was much sugar. They ate at
social meals, not in between. And they were lucky if they had enough
for firsts. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>I'm not saying it's <em>ideal</em> to eat a ton of refined
carbohydrates. I'm willing to concede that brown rice is
(nutritionally) a better default starch that white rice, and I even
happen to like it (short grain, at least). But it's not the chief
issue, from a weight management perspective. The chief issue is not to
eat too damn much, of anything. And the No S Diet helps you do that.</p>

<h2><a id="paradox"></a>The American Paradox</h2>

<p>People talk about the "French Paradox," that the French can eat
fatty, carby, delicious food and still stay skinny while health
conscious, calorie counting Americans are the fattest people on
earth. It seems not only improbable, but unjust. They love their food
and stay skinny, we hate our food and get fat.</p>

<p>Sometimes red wine or olive oil or some other miracle ingredient is
held to account for this. But the thing is, this phenomenon is not so
particularly French. Look to any country where meals and meal times
are still largely governed by tradition and you'll find the same
thing: people make their food choices based on taste instead of health
and somehow stay thin. Japan is often held up as another example. They
also have miracle foods. But their miracle foods are completely
different from the French miracle foods. And keep in mind that obesity
rates in <em>most</em> places are closer to those of France and Japan
than to ours. What do all these countries have in common? Not miracle
foods. We're the schmucks that believe in miracle foods. What they
have in common is traditional structures around when and what and how
you eat. The details may differ a little from country to country, but
there is a surprising degree of overlap. Eating is social, not
solitary. It occurs at set times, not all day long. There is a
difference between ordinary, everyday foods and special festive
treats. Again, sound familiar? No S is really just an attempt to stand
in for such a tradition where it has been corrupted or lost.</p>

<p>The title and some key ideas from this section were lifted from a <a
href="/group/1689.html">New
York Times Magazine Article</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="bars"></a>What about diet bars?</h2>

<p>Any diet that sells a bar or a snack food is a total scam. I'd
rather eat a snickers bar than a zone bar, because at least then I'd
be psychologically budgeting for it. They should call it the self
deception bar. The diet bar is what separates the total scams from the
mere fads.</p>

<h2><a id="timing"></a>Does it matter <em>when</em> I eat my meals?</h2>

<p>You only get a <a href="http://www.threestooges.com/">limited
number</a>, so it makes sense to space them out more or less evenly
over your waking hours. For me, that means breakfast at 7:00, lunch at
12:30, dinner at 7:00. I'm not religious about this, but it's usually
what I do, and think it's helpful. You don't want to give yourself too
long a stretch of time to crave snacks, especially after dinner.</p>

<h2><a id="drinks"></a>What about drinks?</h2>

<p>Sugar drinks, as mentioned above, are out. If you think you'll pop
unless you get your pop, have a look at my <a href="/group/121.html">hierarchy
of pop alternatives</a>.</p>

<p>I don't count alcoholic beverages as esses. I usually have a drink
or two a day, which I've read is supposed to be <a
href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/press/releases/press12101999.html">very
healthy</a>. 2 drinks is my "glass ceiling," however, because I've
read (and experienced) that more than that can be pretty awful. If you
drink that or less, I don't imagine it'll have much impact from a
caloric point of view. If you drink much more, you may have a
different sort of problem altogether.</p>

<p>The subject of drinks isn't to be viewed in purely negative
terms. It's not just about avoiding liquid calories. Drink water
proactively, to ward off hunger. Thirst is often confused with hunger,
and a glass of water can be an effective snack replacement. No, it
doesn't taste quite as good, but yes it can work.</p>

<h2><a id="vacation"></a>What about vacation?</h2>

<p>This isn't much of an issue for American wage slaves like myself;
there just isn't a whole lot of damage you can do in a mere two weeks.
Citizens of more enlightened countries may want to consider it more
closely. My policy is: vacation days are like non-S days, with extra
tolerance for screw ups. There was an interesting <a
href="/group/59.html">thread about this</a> in the discussion
group. Apparently it has worked (<a href="/group/371.html">rather
well</a>) for at least one European.</p>

<h2><a id="social"></a>Is this diet compatible with having
friends/family/a social life of any kind?</h2>

<p>What an odd question! But think about it. Eating is an inherently
social activity. Even in our nuclear age, people tend not to eat
alone. So why is it no other diet plan seems to consider this obvious
and important fact?  It's bad enough that you yourself have to eat the
nasty fare prescribed by them; there's no way you're going to succeed
if you have to convince others to eat it too, or cook separate
meals. The No S Diet dispenses with all that. You eat normal food, just
like the people you're eating with. You just eat less of it. They
don't even have to know you're doing anything different.</p>

<p>No more separate meals. No more awkward excuses at dinner
parties. No more family members secretly or not so secretly hoping
you'll get it over with and fail already so they can go back to eating
normal food again. Who needs this extra stress? Dieting is hard enough
without having to convince other people to go along with it.</p>

<h2><a id="other_s"></a>I can think of other things that start with S...</h2>

<p>So can I. S-days are a useful structure for many kinds of
habits. Among other things, I use it to regulate my <a href="http://www.shovelglove.com/">exercise routine.</a></p>

<p>Diet-wise, people have suggested "soda" (which is technically
already a sugar S, but some people can use the extra reminder) and
"supersizes," which no one really needs, and fast food junkies
especially should watch out for.</p>

<h2><a id="me"></a>Who are you?</h2>

<p>I am neither a doctor, a nurse, a dietician, a nutritionist, a
personal trainer, nor any other kind of health professional. I AM NOT
AN EXPERT. This is a tremendous advantage.</p>

<p>Diet is not a problem that requires specialized expertise. It is a
general problem with an obvious solution. If I were encumbered by any
form of expertise, this obviousnessness wouldn't be nearly as
striking. A doctor cannot convincingly say "<a href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=248">DUH</a>."</p>

<p>I am a librarian by training and a computer programmer by
accident. I noticed I was getting a little too heavy (borderline
obese, actually, if you want to get <a
href="http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/calc-bmi.htm">technical</a>)
and came up with this common sense willpower trick. I lost 20 pounds
in two months and kept them off without spending too much time
suffering or even thinking about it. People I've explained it to have
responded enthusiastically and so I thought I'd stick it on the
web.</p>

<p>I've since lost an additional 20 pounds (so total progress has been
210 to 170), but to be fair, that may have something to do with the
fact that I started doing <a href="http://www.shovelglove.com">some
exercise.</a> This seems to be my natural, healthy weight. People now
describe me as "lean," which is sweet music to a lifelong "husky."</p>

<p>I've been on the diet since <a href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=2729">late 2001</a>, with no yo-yoing. Unlike
most diets, that get more and more insufferable as the gimmick ages,
No s gets progressively easier and becomes largely unconscious. At
this point I'm about as tempted to break the rules as a devout Hindu
is to eat a cow, or a Muslim a pig. It's a great feeling.</p>

<p>(relatively) <b class="no">New!</b> Much as I'd hoped to avoid
this, it seems I have no choice. The obligatory before and after shots
can be found <a href="beforeafter.html">here</a></p>

<h2><a id="fatter"></a>But I am way fatter than you were!</h2>

<p>Then you probably eat way more than I did, and will benefit that
much more from eating less.</p>

<h2><a id="experiences"></a>What are other people saying about the
No S Diet?</h2>

<p>Well, you can always try <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22no%20s%20diet%22&amp;qt_s=Search&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=gw">google</a>.</p>

<p>On March 7th, 2008, the <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=2680">LA Times</a>
mentioned it as one of "ten hot diets", and <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=2660">Woman's
World</a> did a cover story on the No S Diet in their April 14 2008
issue. I've also been <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/interviews/">interviewed</a> a
(small) number of times now by websites, podcasts, and radio
stations.</p>

<p>Oliver Burkeman wrote a<a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/15/healthandwellbeing.features4">
nice piece in the Guardian</a> on my Everyday Systems in general
(let's hope he's wrong about the "Moderation doesn't sell self-help
books" part).</p>

<p>But the best place to look is probably the No S Diet <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewforum.php?f=3">bulletin
board</a>. People have actually started signing up recently and it's a
good place to get support. No "Jared"s just yet, but a bunch of people
have posted high double digit (and even low triple digit) losses.</p>

<p>I've collated a bunch of success stories from the bulletin board
into a <a href="testimonials.html">testimonials page</a>. Since I'm
lazy about keeping this up to date, you may wish also to check out the
<a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewforum.php?f=13">testimonials
section on the bulletin board</a> (aka "yearly check-in"), where
people post their own success stories.</p>

<p>A bunch of <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=3839">No S Diet
blogs</a> have recently started sprouting up -- some with beautiful
and inspiring photographs of what can be done with a single plate.</p>

<p>And of course, the No S Diet exists on Facebook, both as a top down
blog-style <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nosdiet">facebook
page</a>, and as a more democratic discussion <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nosdiet">facebook group</a>. The
distinction between facebook pages and groups eluded me for a while,
but it bascially boils down to this: if you want an occasional, breif
announcement from me, like the page, if you want to discuss no-s with
others, join the group. Or do both.</p>

<h2><a id="now"></a>I want to start this diet NOW. What should I do?</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that the first three weeks are the hardest. At three
weeks the auto pilot of habit starts to kick in. Until then, make your
portions sufficiently generous so that you aren't tempted to
cheat. Once you've made it a few weeks without violating any of the
literal rules, then you can start scaling the portions down a bit
(though you may find, as I did, that you don't even need any conscious
intervention on this score).  The most important part is your
mind. Once you get that lean and tough, the body will follow.</p>

<p>There's nothing like a
sympathetic audience to keep you motivated through those first few
weeks. I've recently set up a <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewforum.php?f=8">daily check-in
forum</a> to facilitate this. Less social types may wish to just slash
days off a calendar.</p>



<a href="http://everydaysystems.com/habitcal"><img alt="Habitcal screenshot" src="images/habitcal.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;"/></a>


<p> (relatively) <b class="no">New!</b> I've created <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/habitcal">HabitCal, a free online
habit tracker</a> to help build good habits like No-s.</p>


<p><a href="http://everydaysystems.com/habitcal/tags/">A rather
surprising number of people</a> are using it to track habits of all
sorts.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>For people who need a physical reminder or talisman, print out the
<a href="images/business_card.pdf">business card</a> and tape it to
your fridge. It may look enormous on your screen, but it prints out
business card size. Or splurge on a real <a
href="http://www.cafepress.com/everydaysystems.14636844">refrigerator
magnet</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="hard"></a>Is it hard?</h2>

<p>It's hard in a different way than most other diets. It can seem harder
 at first because it doesn't pretend that there is some trick to
 bypassing the work of building new habits - it does take willpower and
 patience and discipline. But the hard part is all up front. Once you
 get past this initial hump, once you've turned the rules into
 unconscious habits, it gets easier and easier.</p>

<p> This is in stark contrast to the way other diets work. Forbidden-foods
 diets, like Atkins, seem great at the outset, because you can go on
 being a glutton, gorging on unlimited steaks to compensate for never
 eating pasta or pizza or potatoes again. But it gets old fast. You
 really start to miss the forbidden foods. And then you crack. Counting
 calories is the same way. It can be fun for a week. Sort of a game. But
 after a few months it becomes a time-consuming chore. Every meal
 becomes a math assignment. It's almost a tossup whether you'd be more
 miserable sticking your diet or quitting and getting fat again. </p>
 
 <p>Which brings me to another great thing about the No S Diet: it's never really
 hard in the sense of being unpleasant, even at the very beginning. It
 might take discipline, it might take patience, but it doesn't take
 suffering. In fact, you'll enjoy food more. The spotlight of three
 single-plate meals doesn't just catch excess, it focuses appreciation.
 And you'll enjoy your sweets on weekends and holidays more than you
 ever did before. </p>
 
<p> Lastly, it's socially unobtrusive. People don't have
 to cook you separate meals, as they would on a low-carb plan, for
 instance. Most of the time, they won't even notice you're on a diet,
 much less be inconvenienced by it.</p>

<h2><a id="habit"></a>Willpower vs. Habit</h2>

<p><i>Nothing is more powerful than habit.</i> - Ovid</p>

<p><i>Habit is overcome by habit.</i> -Thomas a Kempis</p>

<p><i>Habit is either the best of servants or the worst of
masters.</i> - Nathaniel Emmons</p>

<p>Willpower can't win against habit, it's hopelessly outmatched. It's
like a bare-fisted man trying to duke it out with an elephant. But I'm
sure you know this already from personal experience, from having been
on the receiving end of bad habits for so many years.</p>

<p>The trick is to make habit work for you, not to engage it head on
or duck out of its way every time you see it coming (as the magic
pill diets would have you do). Men do tame elephants, after all, and
then ride on their backs, and compel them to pull ten ton logs that a
dozen strong men couldn't budge. In the same way, willpower can tame
habit. And habit working <em>for</em> you is a remarkable thing.</p>

<p>Carrot and stick is the proverbial way to tame an animal. S-day
and non S-day are our carrot and stick. As with animals, we insist on
only a few clear points, so the beast doesn't feel threatened and
attack. But these few points must be strictly enforced. Give the beast
some room, but stand by the lines you've made and roar like a maniac
when it tries to cross. The firmer you are, the faster your habit will
learn. Sure this takes effort up front. But once habit is trained, you
won't need much will, a slight pressure of the spurs is all it
takes.</p>

<p>Don't believe diets that tell you you don't need to alter your
habits. Because there is only so long you can duck that
elephant. Sooner or later it's going to have you in a corner, and if
you haven't tamed it, you're squashed.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a
href="/group/1142.html">Diane
Sheats</a> for the Nathanial Emmons quote.</p>

<h2><a id="try"></a>Sometimes it takes a false start (or 12)</h2>

<p>Some people, like me, get No S the first time they try it. It works
and it sticks. But most people have a bit more trouble than that. In
fact, you might do best if you assume you'll screw up the first time,
so you don't get too discouraged. Consider it a reconnaissance
mission, a trial run, just to feel out how hard it's going to be and
where problems are going to arise. If the enemy, appetite, turns out
to be such a chump that your reconnaissance mission routs him, great,
you've succeeded. It might be that easy, you won't know until you
try. If not, you've learned more about him, where he's likely to
ambush you. You're stronger, better prepared for next time. Don't feel
stupid for trying and failing. Success is the sum of many
failures. This isn't just pep talk. According to a recent <a
href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A10995-2002Jan7&amp;notFound=true">article</a>
I was pointed to (thanks, <a
href="/group/2065.html">Valerie</a>):</p>

<p class="quote">
Studies show that altering eating habits for good requires 10 to 12
concerted attempts to succeed - which is to say about a dozen failures
come before the eventual success. "That's not reason to despair," said
John Norcross, professor of psychology at the University of Scranton
in Pennsylvania and a researcher on self-initiated change. "If
anything, it's reason to say, 'I'm not doing so bad.' "
</p>

<p>So quit dawdling and get some failures under your belt!</p>

<p>Need something more inspirational than another pseudostatistic? Try
Winston Churchill: "Success consists of going from failure to failure
without loss of enthusiasm."</p>

<h2><a id="abstraction"></a>The Right Level of Abstraction</h2>

<p>Most commercial diets are too complicated for people with outside
interests to follow ("eating = math"). Most conventional wisdom rules
about diet are too simplistic and vague to be useful ("only
eat when you're hungry"). The No S Diet finds the happy medium between
the two. It's simple <em>and</em> specific. As a computer programmer,
I'm always looking for the right level of abstraction for the problem
at hand -- the simplest way of conceptualizing a problem that will
actually solve it. For diet, I think this is it.</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://www.danmcvicker.com">thoughtful poster</a> to
the No S Diet group <a href="/group/281.html">put
it</a>:</p>

<p class="quote">
It reminds me of a Buddhist proverb:

"Before I studied Zen, a mountain was just a
mountain...after I began to study Zen, a mountain was
no longer just a mountain, then, when I completed my
studies, the mountain became a mountain again."

All that means is, if you look at the problem of
weight loss in very short terms, No-S looks like a
great solution. If you start studying it, things get
confusing and it may look like No-S isn't the best
solution any more. After you've spent a few years on
the problem, you realize that No-S is a great
solution, and that there are a bunch of fairly
complicated things you can do to make it marginally
better. But is it worth years to figure out how to
make a great solution marginally better?
</p>

<h2><a id="micromanage"></a>Don't micromanage yourself</h2>

<p>Here's another analogy that illustrates the same point as the
above:</p>

<p>Commercial diets are like the boss who micromanages. It's clear what
you have to do, but you resent being dictated to in every detail, and
you soon start sending around your resume.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom ("just don't eat too much") is like the boss
whose instructions are too vague ("just do it") and refuses further
clarification ("isn't it obvious?"). The only thing that's clear is
that you aren't doing your job.</p>

<p>The No S Diet is like The Good Boss. You have just enough direction
to do your job, but not so much that you resent its imposition. You
have a solid framework, but the details are up to you. You have
sufficient guidance <em>and</em> sufficient freedom. It's a system
without too much system.</p>

<h2><a id="moderation_revolution"></a><a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewforum.php?f=3">Join</a> the
Moderation Revolution!</h2>

<p>As another insightful poster to the group has <a
href="/group/288.html">pointed out</a>, in an age when everything is
excessive, it's moderation that's revolutionary. When cereal boxes and
candy bar wrappers talk about revolution, the radical thing to do is
<a href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/profile.php?mode=register&amp;agreed=true">opt out</a>.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://everydaysystems.com/podcast/episode.php?id=21">more on the advantages of structured moderation here</a>)</p>

<h2><a id="progress"></a>I've been on the diet a whole week and I'm not
skinny yet!</h2>

<p>Don't wig out if you don't lose ten pounds the first day. This is a
marathon, not a sprint. Progress is slow, but maintainable. It's going
to take a while but it's also going to last a while -- your whole
life. Don't sabotage your efforts with quick-fix expectations.</p>



<h2><a id="diet_envy"></a>But I know someone who lost xxx pounds on some
other diet!</h2>

<p>Good for them. They're lucky. Most people who tried that diet
failed. And hey, though I wish them the best, there's still plenty of
time left for that -- a whole lifetime.</p>

<p>It's a little nightmarish to imagine spending a whole lifetime on
most diets. Think about it. If your goal is a nightmare, how can you
possibly succeed? If you can't even <em>imagine</em> it, how on earth
are you going to <em>do</em> it? Why would you even want to?</p>

<p>Conventional diets aren't ineffective, in an abstract, biochemical
sense. <i>If</i> you stick with one, you'll probably lose
weight. They're just really unpleasant and difficult to be on, so you
almost certainly <i>won't</i>. Occasionally someone does manage to
stick it out for a few months or years. But the vast majority
don't. And people live inconveniently long lives for the purposes of
scientific studies, so lifetime numbers are presumably sadder
still. So put your diet envy aside and go with a diet that not only
works (the easy part), but admits of pleasant dreams for the
future.</p>

<h2>So how long is it going to take?</h2>

<p>Sustainable weight loss tends to be very slow. A crude (but still
useful) estimate is about half a pound a week. You're not going to
notice this staring at a scale before you go crazy, it's going to get
lost in random, meaningless fluctuations. So don't try -- focus on
your <em>behavior</em> instead (the <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/habitcal">HabitCal</a> is a good,
concrete tool to help you do this).</p>

<p>Half a pound a week might not sound like much, but adds up to quite
a bit over months and years. But you're never going make it that far
if you obsess over short term results.</p>

<h2><a id="problem_worth_solving"></a>A Problem worth Solving</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in <a
href="/group/601.html">this
post</a>, most other diets are heavily optimized for short term weight
loss. It's a much easier problem to solve than long term, and it makes
for great ads ("20 pounds in 2 weeks, belly fat first!"). But it's not
really a problem worth solving, because when the weight comes back
(and it will), you're even worse off than you were before.</p>

<p>The No S Diet is slow, but it's permanent. It's humane enough that
you can do it your whole life. I find it <em>enhances</em> my
enjoyment of food.</p>

<p>And I don't think it's any harder than the quickie systems. It just
requires that you face certain issues up front. Like the fact that
ultimately, diets don't "work," <em>you</em> work. The No S Diet is a
good system in that it doesn't deceive you into believing otherwise.
It insists that you confront the problem of appetite head on and gives
you a little structure to organize your efforts.</p>

<p>There's no magic. There's no passive "wait and see." You'll lose
weight because you'll eat less. And you'll know whether you're eating
less because your windows of opportunity are few and easy to
monitor.</p>

<h2><a id="different_normal"></a>A Different Kind of Normal</h2>

<p>I'm not going to lie to you: the No S Diet <em>is</em> a diet, a
bunch of rules about how you should eat. But the idea is that the
rules are simple and intuitive enough that they'll eventually become
habit, second nature. A poster to the group <a
href="/group/628.html"> put
it beautifully</a>:</p>

<p class="quote">
A month in, I don't think I'm on a diet anymore. I'm just eating
normally, but it's a different normally than a month ago. There's
nothing left to stick to; eating because I'm bored is unsatisfying
now, going for seconds leaves me feeling uncomfortably full, and
sweets that aren't *treats* are nowhere near as satisfying as they
used to be.
</p>

<p>In the interests of full disclosure, I should point out that not
every successful nosdieter feels this way. For some, it remains an
active effort, but they still find it satisfying and worth
it. Consider the following <a
href="/group/631.html">post</a>:</p>

<p class="quote">
I personally am not like Reinhard
says, I want candy, every day, I wanna go into the fridge at work, and
grab one of those snickers that are in there...but, if I start walking
towards it, I just tell myself, "no you don't need that." and turn
around. That also is a great feeling.
</p>

<h2><a id="nodollarsign"></a>The No $ Diet</h2>

<p>As you may have noticed, this site is free. But that's the least of
it. Far more significant is that the No S Diet doesn't require you to
buy any pricey diet products or exotic foods. You buy the same food
you used to buy, just less of it -- what a novel concept!</p>

<p>You laugh, but this can really add up. The diet gurus are laughing
all the way to the bank. You know what they say, "give away the razor,
make money on the razor blades." A study in Forbes magazine showed
that <a
href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/invest/forbes/P114424.asp">most
popular diets cost hundreds of extra dollars a month</a>. All of the
diets reviewed cost more than the status quo of mere overeating. This
is a little absurd when you consider that the goal is (or ought to be)
to eat less.</p>

<p>On the No S Diet you eat less, you buy less, and you <em>save</em>
money. It feels a little strange for me to have to point this out, but
considering the competition, I guess I do.</p>

<h2><a id="payme"></a>This diet actually works! How can I repay you?</h2>

<p>You can't! At least, not directly. I used to have a tongue in cheek
paypal donation link here (the idea was you send me a <i>Merchant of
Venice</i> inspired dollar per pound of flesh lost), but as I was
subsequently informed:</p>

<p class="quote">
Google policy does not permit the
advertisement of websites that contain "the
solicitation of funds and
do not display tax-exempt status".
</p>

<p>Translation: my adwords competitors complained and this was the
only excuse they could come up with. I'm flattered! Who would have
thought a little gnat site running out of a basement could get the
attention of multi million dollar competitors? I must really be onto
something.</p>

<p>Now let's just hope google policy does not forbid the mention of
google policy...</p>

<p>I do, strangely enough. I'm giving this thing away for free and
would prefer to at least get credit for it. So please lay off Nosdiet
TM, NoSDiet TM, Nos Diet TM, Nos-Diet TM, No's Diet TM, No Es Diet TM,
No S Diet TM, S-Days TM, and No Esses Diet TM (you get the idea).</p>

<p><b class="no">New!</b> Notice the little &reg; after the "No S
Diet" at the top of the page. Having been thoroughly terrified by my
lawyer friends, I've actually gone through the trouble and expense to
officially register this thing. I don't use it everywhere because that
would be incredibly obnoxious and <a

<h2><a id="disclaimer"></a>If I somehow manage to injure myself eating
moderately as you describe, can I sue you?</h2>

<p>Not unless you can afford a lawyer good enough to punch a hole in
the following disclaimer (in which case it really isn't worth your
while going after small fry like me -- go spill some hot coffee on
yourself at McDonald's instead):</p>
