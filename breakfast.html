<h2><a href="./">NoSDiet</a>: The Breakfast Page</h2>

<p>Although people seem to have more <em>problems</em> with dinner,
they have the most <em>questions</em> about breakfast. Many good
answers have been provided in the <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/nosdiet">nosdiet yahoo group</a>, but they can be
difficult to find now that the number of messages is approaching
1000. So I'm consolodating them here.</p>

<p>The truth is, it's only one question, asked over and over again:
<b>what do I eat for breakfast if I can't eat my beloved pop tarts and
sugar cereal?</b> I personally don't have trouble with this issue, but
it does come up a lot.</p>

<p>Note: this list isn't intended to be exhaustive or exemplary. It's
for people who are wracking their brains to come up with something at
least marginally better than the pop tart they are craving. If you
don't like what you see, <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/nosdiet/join">post</a> your better ideas (or
desperate pleas) to the group. And in case I missed something, <a
href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/nosdiet/messagesearch?query=breakfast">this link</a> will take you to a list of every post that
contains the word "breakfast."</p>

<p>Enough caveats, here's the list:</p>

<p>In parting, I'd like you to keep a couple of things in mind. Before
you go off about how cruel and unusual to nosdiet is for forbidding
your breakfast pop tarts consider:</p>

<ol>

<li>What the low carb competition would have to say about it
("never!")</li>

<li>That you're at most 5 days away from a guilt free poptart or bowl
of sugar smacks.</li>

</ol>
