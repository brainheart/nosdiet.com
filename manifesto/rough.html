<h2>The No <img width="72" height="73" src="../images/nos.png" align="center" /> Diet Manifesto

<font face="arial" size="-2">[ An <a href="http://www.everydaysystems.com">Everyday Systems</a> publication</a> ]</font>

</h2>

<p>The NoSDiet, described below, is a diet I invented for myself that
I imagine might work for similarly minded people.</p>

<p>No funny science or calorie accounting
involved, just a few simple and mnemonic tricks for giving your
willpower the upper hand.</p>

<p>I spell it <i>nosdiet</i> for easy googling and pronounce it
<i>Noes</i> or <i>No Esses</i> or <i>No Es</i> diet, depending on
which aspect of the pun I feel like emphasizing.</p>

<p>There are just three rules and one exception:</p>

<ul>
<li><font color="red">No S</font>nacks</li>
<li><font color="red">No S</font>weets</li>
<li><font color="red">No S</font>econds</li>
</ul>

<p>Except (sometimes) on days that start with 's'</p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>Too simple for you?  Read on for
explanations, justifications, and rants.</p>

<h2>Why should I buy this book?</h2>

<p>...since I gave away the whole diet on the cover. And I'm not being
cute. That's really all you need. You can put this book down, walk
away, and lose weight, just be remembering and sticking to those 14
words.</p>

<p>But there are some reasons why you still might want to buy it.</p>

<ol>

<li>As a reminder for yourself. 14 words should be easy enough to
remember, but some people find having a little physical totem to carry
around helps remind them that these words apply to them. See also the
businesscards and refigerator magnet at the back of the book.</li>

<li>As a slightly obnoxious gift for someone else. It makes a great
stocking stuffer.</li>

<li>Because by buying this book you are psychologically buying into
the diet. If you don't buy it, how can you really buy it, right?
That's the American way.</li>

<li>Because it's entertaining.</li>

<li>Because I've anticipated just about every way you can weasel out
of following the rules strictly and your willpower is so depleted and
your appetite so sneaky that you need to have these hammered into you
over and over again.</li>

<li>Because you think it might really work or have already lost weight
with it and want to tip the author.</li>

<li>Because it's cheap.</li>

</ol>

<a name="others"></a><h2>Why are other diets so lousy?</h2>
<p>Most diets today can be divided into two categories:
<ol>

<li>Pseudo-science (or "focused-gluttony") diets that hold you can go
on being a glutton as long as you focus your gluttony on particular
kinds foods to the exclusion of others (no agreement on what these
particular kinds of foods are, of course). It's funny that these diets
masquerade as scientific, because psychologically they rely on the
most primitive magicism: magic potion foods that are good for you and
can be gorged with impunity, and cursed poison foods that explode with
a mouthful (carbohydrates and fat are the two biggies, alternating
roles).</li>

<p></p>

<li>Diets that require you to be a full time calorie accountant.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The pseudo-science diets are patent nonsense. They contradict one
another, go in and out of fashion every ten years, and never seem to
gather any serious scientific support. You won't stick with one of
these because it won't work and <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/diet.fitness/03/20/protein.diet.heart/">it
might even make you sick.</a></p>

<p> The calorie accounting diets are time consuming and joyless. You
won't be able to stick with one of these because it will make you
miserable. If you think of food as fuel, a mere quantity, you'll come
to hate it -- and yourself.</p>

<!-- pagebreak -->

<p>Pretty much any diet will lose you weight if you stick with it. The
problem isn't how to lose weight. The problem is how to stick with the
diet. <a href="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/wgtloss.html">According to
the FDA</a>, 95% of dieters fail to do this for more than a few months
at a time. You need a diet that acknowledges this grim statistic and
targets the real culprit: not your belly, but your mind.</p>

<a name="superior"><h2>Why is this diet so much better?</h2>

<p>Because it is simple, sustainable, and you aren't really depriving
yourself of anything. You don't have to sacrifice anything -- not
time, not health, not any delicious thing. There are no magic potions
and there are no poisons. You are targeting just the culprit, just the
bad habit of overeating itself.</p>

<p>Overeating is first and foremost a bad habit. Bad habits are
overcome by willpower. Willpower doesn't work unless it has clear,
limited goals. And that's just what the NoSDiet consists of -- a
crutch and a focus for your willpower.</p>

<p>And I imagine it's also good for your teeth (no sugar).</p>

<p>Ask yourself if you can imagine staying on a particular diet for
the rest of your life. If not, don't bother starting, it's a waste of
time and will.</p>

<a name="featherwieght"><h2>That's much too rational and
straightforward. Come on, REALLY, why is this diet so much
better?</h2>

<p>You wouldn't take diet advice from a fat person, why take it from a
fat book? Weighing in at just 14 words, the NoSDiet is the ultra
featherweight of diet plans.</p>

<a name="evidence"><h2>Is there any scientific evidence that this diet
 works?</h2>

<p>Absolutely none. But I'm not aware that I have any competition in
this regard.</p>

<a name="sdays"><h2>What days start with "s"?</h2>

<p>Saturday, Sunday and "Special" days. Special days include (your)
national and (your) religious and (your) close family and friend's
birthdays. My apologies to atheists and non-native English speakers. A
lean and hungry look becomes you.</p>

<a name="sometimes"><h2>What do you mean by "sometimes"?</h2>

<p>I stuck the word 'sometimes' in the exception to remind you not to
be an idiot on S-days. It's been my experience that the good habits
you build on the non-S-days will see you through the S-days without
too much excess. My S-days tend to be no worse than my pre-NoSDiet
ordinary days.</p>

<a name="seconds"><h2>What do you mean by "seconds?"</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in a <a
 href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nosdiet/message/27">post</a> to
 the nosdiet yahoo group, by "no seconds," I officially mean one
 physical plate, and I think for beginners especially it's good to
 stick with this, even if it means a fairly overloaded plate. If the
 amount of food on your one plate is a little bestial and disgusting,
 that's part of the educational process.
</p>

<a name="sweets"><h2>What do you mean by "sweets"?</h2>

<p>I mean something whose principal source of calories is sugar. Go
ahead and put sugar in your coffee or oatmeal; you have my
blessing. Of course fruits are fine. </p>

<p>But beware of soda and corn syrup "juice" drinks. I'm not just being a
killjoy; Americans get an estimated 10% of their calories from such
nutritionally bankrupt "liquid carbohydrates." (footnote pending)</p>

<p>I wouldn't worry too much about borderline foods like yoghurt and
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. If these are a problem for you,
i.e., you eat them every day and lay it on thick, then make them
esses. If not, don't. Just by targeting the really egregious offenders
you'll be cutting out a lot of calories. And you'll be that much more
likely to stick with the plan. If you're like most first worlders,
it's a little revolting to think how much unambiguously crappy food
you consume. So forget the borderline cases, the clear cut cases are
80% of the problem and 0% of the headache.</p>

<p>This is probably the most important S. Do you know how many pounds
of sugar the average American ingests today? <a
href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/AmberWaves/April03/Indicators/behinddata.htm">According
to the USDA's Economic Research Service</a>, 105 pounds (2001). That's
about 20% of total calories. You could make a snowman out of
that. That's less than 2 years till you've eaten your body weight in
sugar. If you're a real whopper, chances are you eat even more sugar
than that, so I figure it works out about the same. And this is a
pretty conservative number. The ERS assumes that over 40 pounds of
"delivered" sugar is "lost" (147 delivered, 105 ingested), which I
find a little hard to believe, but I guess we're wastrels as well as
gluttons.</p>

<!-- pagebreak -->

<p>How do you think that compares with the sugar intake of our
ancestors? We don't have to go back to hunter gatherer times to find a
striking contrast, or even before Columbus (when it was close to nil
because there was no refined sugar in most places). 1821 will do: 10
pounds (that's delivered, not ingested!). (footnote pending)</p>

<p>You don't need to be an Atkins nut to see there's a problem
here. Indeed, why bother taking it to the next level, severely
restricting carbs in general, with all the dubious health issues that
entails, when there is plenty problem here, at the sugar level? If
orange juice is really your problem, you don't have much of a
problem.</p>


<p>I'm not some food hating, pleasure begrudging voice in the
wilderness. I'm not telling you to give up sweets completely. I love
sweets. But I love them even more on S days. That way I can love them
unreservedly, without also hating them for what they do to my body. On
S-days, I make sure to pick out something really nice, to make it
count. Sweets weren't designed for daily, routine consumption,
physically or spiritually. Deserve your desserts. They taste much
better that way.</p>

<h2><a name="fake_sugar"></a><h2>Does fake sugar count as an "s"?</h2>

<p><p>As I mentioned in a <a
 href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nosdiet/message/40">post</a> to
 the nosdiet yahoo group, I would avoid fake sugar products for 3
 reasons.</p>
 
<ol>
 <li>they tend to be pretty disgusting</li>
 
 <li>you *know* that in 10 years scientists are going to
 discover that they're even worse for you than real
 sugar.</li>
 
 <li>you might be fooling your taste buds, but you're
 also fooling the habit forming portion of your brain.
 It's bad psychology, and the whole premise of the
 nosdiet is that psychology is the most important part.</li>

</ol>

<p>So does it officially count as an S? No. But I'd be
 surprised if you can eat a lot of it without reverting
 to genuine S.</p>
 
<a name="snacks"></a><h2>What about healthy snacks?</h2>

<p>Eat healthy meals. If you know you have just three, you'll make
them count. I'm perfectly aware that an orange between meals is not
going kill you, that, taken in itself, it's perfectly healthy. But the
idea is to have the orange instead of, not in addition to, and in
justification of, some unhealthy part of your meal. The problem is
primarily one of self-discipline, and if you start making all kinds of
exceptions, you'll fail.</p>

<a name="nutrition"><h2>What about nutrition?</h2>

<p>The nosdiet is a framework for controlling excess. Beyond that it
makes no stipulations about your nutritional or gastronomic
choices. That doesn't mean they're not important, they're just
separate issues. Fight one enemy at a time, not three at once.</p>

<p>That said, I find that having a limited number of limited quantity
meals makes me take them more seriously, both from a gastronomic and a
nutritional point of view. Pretty much every meal I eat is delicious
or healthy or both.</p>

<p>If you feel the need to take a systematic approach towards
nutrition too, be my guest. The nosdiet is compatible with pretty much
every other diet plan I've come across. You can be a No-S/Vegan if
you want (shudder). You could even do No-S plus Atkins, or No-S/Zone
if you want to hedge your weight loss bets (though I think it's
becoming increasingly clear these last two examples are emphatically
*not* going to help you in the nutrition department, if at all).</li>

<a name="exercise"><h2>What about exercise?</h2>

<p>Of course you should exercise. Diet can't substitute for
exercise. You need to do both. If you're having trouble figuring out
what exercise to do, consider <a
href="http://www.urbanranger.com">walking</a>. If you feel walking is
too, well, pedestrian, get over it. Health-wise, it's the best long
term exercise you can do, and the only consistently useful or
interesting one. If you need more color, you'll get plenty using my <a
href="http://www.shovelglove.com/">homemade exercise machine</a> as a
supplement.</p>

<a name="kate"><h2>Will this diet help me look like Kate Moss?</h2>

<p>No. It will help you attain and maintain a healthy and therefore
presumably attractive weight. I'm not sure it's healthy to look like
Kate Moss.</p>

<p>It won't help you look like Victoria Beckham, known as Posh
Spice, Courtney Cox, or Calista Flockhart, either (I just threw that
in there for the <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=anorexic+role+models&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">search
engines</a>. Sneaky, yes, but who knows <a href="lumberjack.html">how
many</a> young lives l'm saving :)).</p>

<a name="idiot"><h2>What if I am an idiot and insist on following the
letter of the law but breaking it in spirit by (say) eating a gallon
of ice cream every S-day and counting my second cousin's hamster's
birthday as an S-day?</h2>

<p>Then I can't help you. You will be fat and die young.</p>

<a name="screwup"><h2>What if I screw up?</h2>

<p>Say "I screwed up" and try not to do it again. Don't try to
compensate for your screw up by extra deprivations -- self-revenge
will only make you resentful and that much more likely to quit
altogether. This diet isn't about perfection, it's about staying
healthy. It's about what you do most of the time, not about achieving
some kind of world's record. </p>

<p>The other advantage of this attitude is that it deprives you of a
very seductive excuse -- I can cheat <i>because</i> I can make up for
it later. The knowledge that there is no make up test, that you have
only one chance to do each day right, will make you that much more
serious about passing the first and only time around. It's a principle
worth applying to other aspects of life.</p>

<a name="genes"><h2>But I'm genetically fat!</h2>

<p>It's possible, but <i>you</i> probably aren't. Go to a poor
country. Where are all the fat people? Moved to America? Fat
chance.</p>

<p>If you're still convinced that you've been doomed by your genes,
view this diet as an experiment. If you can stick with it for 6 months
and not lose a significant amount of weight, then you can plead
genetics with a clear conscience. And I suspect you'll be at least a
<i>somewhat</i> skinnier genetically fat person.</p>

<a name="graze"><h2>But I'm a grazer!</h2>

<p>This is a more sophisticated excuse. Under laboratory conditions,
people who eat a controlled amount of calories over the course of many
small meals metabolize them more efficiently than people who eat the
same amount of calories in the traditional three. Where's the rub? In
real word conditions, people who eat more frequently than the
traditional three square meals wind up just plain eating more food --
substantially more. And despite their metabolism's scrambling, they
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12084369&dopt=Abstract">chunk up</a>. The NoSdiet isn't a lab
diet, biology divorced from psychology. It's a real world diet, built
to withstand the pressures of your stubborn, sneaky mind.</p>

<a name="excuse"><h2>But I want an excuse, not a solution!</h2>

<p>It sounds crazy, but a lot of people think like this. They'd prefer
to stay fat and blame McDonalds or refined carbohydrates or
hydrogenated vegetable oil or their lousy genes or anyone and anything
but themselves. I'm not saying these things aren't factors, but they
are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is just that: human
decision.</p>

<p>Responsibility can be liberating. If it's your fault, then chances
are you can fix it. If it's not your fault, then you probably
can't. Would you really prefer that a problem be insoluble than have
to work to fix it?</p>

<p>Health aside, I'm amazed at how many people prefer to trade their
sense of free will and human dignity for carte blanche to fail. It's
like Esau selling his divine birthright for a mess of pottage,
choosing to be a slave because it is easier than being free. If you're
one of those, keep searching, this diet isn't for you.</p>

<a name="side_effects"><h2>Are there any side effects?</h2>

<p>Yes. By setting your willpower up to succeed, and succeeding a
little bit every day, you will build up general purpose
willpower. It's like doing 50 spiritual pushups every
morning. Contrast this with the effects of the repeated failures of
willpower associated with mainstream yoyo dieting.</p>

<a name="sunday_thursday"><h2>Can I take my Sunday Thursday?
(etc.).</h2>

<p>Not officially.</p>

<a name="some_s"><h2>Can I do a "some-S" diet?</h2>

<p>You can do whatever you want, I'm not going to excommunicate you,
but this isn't a good idea. No-S isn't that hard. Try doing it
strictly for 3 weeks, that's about how long it takes to form a
habit. You'll be surprised.</p>

<a name="fence"><h2>Fence around the Diet</h2>

<p> There's a Jewish expression, "Fence around the Law," which means
don't do anything that might possibly be interpreted as giving even
the appearance of violating sacred law. It's a principal that has its
use even with profaner stuff. When your habit is young, be as strict
as you can be, comically strict even. Only when you're strong, when
the habit is largely unconscious, can you afford stretchers like the
above.</p>

<p>It might seem counterintuitive, but strictness makes things
easier. There is no decision to be made, no wrangling, no "can I?
can't I?". You're pre-disapproved, so forget it and move on to
something else. Thursdays and fruit tarts take on the aspect of
concrete walls, mine fields, and concertina wire. There's no point
even trying to cross.</p>

<h2><a name="doctor"></a>I love the NoSDiet, but my doctor says I need to
eat 4/5/6 meals a day because of my medical condition!</h2>

<p>The nosdiet has a little known loophole just for you. If you look
closely at the site, you'll notice that nowhere does it specify the
actual *number* of meals. Now most people will make a <a
href="http://www.threestooges.com/">certain assumption</a>, and most
people had better stick with that assumption. But if you have a
medical condition that requires you to eat more often, you can still
do so and be a proud nosdieter. Just make sure to figure out what
number of meals is right for you, stick with it (no changing the magic
number every day), and invest in some really small plates. As for the
rest of you, pretend you never read this. It's for people with
doctor's notes only.</p>

<a name="recipes"><h2>Are there any NoSDiet recipes?</h2>

<p>No. Have you ever <em>eaten</em> a meal cooked from a recipe in a
diet book? My experience has been that they're pretty disgusting. Diet
books tend not to be written by people who actually like to
eat. Besides, the nosdiet isn't about <em>what</em> you eat. It's
about <em>when</em> you eat. You can eat anything you want -- at the
right time. So use your normal cookbook. It's nosdiet approved.</p>

<p>Recipes do make great filler, however, which I'm sure is why diet
books are so full of them.</p>

<a name="other_s"><h2>I can think of other things that start with S...</h2>

<p>So can I. S-days are a useful structure for many kinds of
habits (links pending).</p>

<a name="me"><h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>I am a librarian by training and a computer programmer by
accident. I have no training as a nutritionist. I noticed I was
getting a little too heavy and came up with this common sense
willpower trick. I lost over 20 pounds in two months and kept them off
without spending too much time suffering or even thinking about
it. People I've explained it to have responded enthusiastically and so
I thought I'd stick it on the web.</p>

<p>I've since lost an additional 15 pounds (so total progress has been
210 to 175), but to be fair, that may have something to do with the
fact that I started doing <a href="http://www.shovelglove.com">some
exercise.</a> This seems to be my natural, healthy weight. People now
describe me as "lean," which is sweet music to a lifelong "husky."</p>

<p>I've been on the diet since March 2002, with no yo-yoing. Unlike
most diets, that get more and more insufferable as the gimmick ages,
no-s gets progressively easier and becomes largely unconscious. At
this point I'm about as tempted to break the rules as a devout Hindu
is to eat a cow, or a Muslim a pig. It's a great feeling.</p>

<a name="experiences"><h2>What are other people saying about the NoSDiet?</h2>

<p>Not much, I'm afraid. But <a
href="mailto:beautiful_idiot@yahoo.com">send me email</a> and I'll put
it up on a feedback page. Or just google for <i>nosdiet</i> on <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=nosdiet&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search"
>Usenet</a>
or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nosdiet">the web</a>.</p>

<p>I set up a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nosdiet/">nosdiet
yahoo group</a> for (slightly) more intimate discussions, polls, and
other time killing nonsense. People have actually started signing up
recently and it's becoming a good place to get support if you want to
give the diet a try. You can set it to "daily digest" or "no email" if
you're afraid of getting bombarded (not much danger of that at
present).</p>

<p>If you're really bored, have a look at my <a
href="lumberjack.html">nosdiet website usage statistics page</a>.</p>

<a name="payme"><h2>This diet actually works! How can I repay you?</h2>

<p>You can't! I used to have a tongue in cheek paypal donation link
here (the idea was you send me a <i>Merchant of Venice</i> inspired
dollar per pound of flesh lost), but as I was recently informed:</p>

<pre>
Google policy does not permit the
advertisement of websites that contain "the
solicitation of funds and
do not display tax-exempt status".
</pre>

<p>Translation: my adwords competitors complained and this was the
only excuse they could come up with. I'm flattered! Who would have
thought a little gnat site running out of a basement could get the
attention of multi million dollar competitors? I must really be onto
something. And I think I can do without the 2 cents the link brought
in.</p>

<p>Now let's just hope google policy does not forbid the mention of
google policy...</p>

<p>What you still can do is mention this site to people you know, and
link to it if you have a website. A full log file is riches enough for
me. And if enough people do it, who knows, maybe I can sell T-shirts
and coffee mugs or something one day.</p>

<p>Those whose senses of generosity and gratitude are so highly
developed that this just won't do may wish to look carefully at <a
href="http://www.shovelglove.com/">my other site</a>.<p>

<a name="adwords"></a><h2>If you aren't making any money off this, why
are you advertising?</h2>

<p><a href="http://adwords.google.com/">Google adwords</a> lets me
place ads for just 5 cents a click, with a daily cap of $2. So it's
cheap. Their interface is easy and fun and your changes take effect
right away. People who pay more than the minimum 5 cents a click have
their ads placed higher up, but ads with a very high clickthrough rate
get bumped up a bit. My ads do pretty well in this regard, and it's
fun coming up with ads that place better than those of presumably much
better funded commercial plans.</p>

<p>Yes, marketing is my hobby. I'm sure this utterly perplexes the
competition. Some people spend 30 bucks a month playing online video
games, I do this. And who knows, maybe it'll actually help
someone.</p>

<a name="merchandise"></a><h2>Can I buy noSdiet branded merchandise
such as t-shirts, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons, coffee
mugs, plates, calendars, bumper stickers, business cards, lunchboxes,
etc. with the entire diet (all 14 words) printed on them?</h2>

<p>Not at the present time.</p>

<p> I've got a <a href="images/business_card.pdf">business card</a>,
which you are welcome to print out and distribute, if you can figure
out how.</p>

<p>(relatively) <b><font color="red">New!</b></font> I'm also working
working (very slowly) on a "Propaganda Pack," consisting of some of
the above, and a NoSDiet Manifesto, which will pretty much just be a
high production value, minibook sized printout of this site, but might
make a nice motivational souvenir/stocking stuffer. <a
href="mailto:beautiful_idiot@yahoo.com">Let me know</a> if you're
interested in either of these, and I might finish it within the
lifetime of the universe.</p>

<h2>Why should I bookmark this page and visit it again, and again, and
again?</h2>

<p>Because it changes frequently. I tweak it obsessively. Add it to
the litany of sites you check every day to distract you from your
job. You can tell immediately whether something has changed since you
last checked because whenever I make a change the time stamp at the
bottom of the page is updated.
</p>

<a name="tm"><h2>This is a terrific idea! Mind if I steal it?</h2>

<p>I do, strangely enough. I'm giving this thing away for free and
would prefer to at least get credit for it. So please lay off Nosdiet
TM, NoSDiet TM, Nos Diet TM, Nos-Diet TM, No's Diet TM, No Es Diet TM,
No S Diet TM, S-Days TM, and No Esses Diet TM (you get the idea).</p>
